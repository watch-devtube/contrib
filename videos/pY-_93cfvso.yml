language: English
recordingDate: 1492501950
description: "C++ programmers want fast and small code that is safe, generic and reusable. This talk shows how using the C++ type system and templates can achieve this using simple lightweight abstractions.\n\nType-rich APIs help avoid errors whilst improving readability, and template techniques provide reusable libraries for operators and their relationships with zero run-time overhead."
