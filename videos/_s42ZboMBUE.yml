description: "A new web series from Google Developers. We search high and low for awesome projects that are made with Android. In our pilot episode, we meet the CasaDeBalloon.club. They send Android equipped balloons into the atmosphere and track them as they fall to earth. This provides awesome photos and even more awesome data.\n\nWhat do you make with Android? Do you have a passion project that is using Android, is open source and does something radically cool and unexpected? Let us know...put it in the comments, maybe we'll put you on Made with Android.\n\nFor more information on this project visit: http://CasaDeBalloon.Club\nfollow the CDBC: \nhttps://plus.google.com/111566191079224201975/\nand subscribe to the Google Developers YouTube channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
