description: "Java EE encourages a lean development approach without any ceremony. The vast majority of already established J2EE and most of the GoF patterns have become superfluous. In this session, the speaker builds a Java EE 7 CRUD application, using a continuous development style, while discussing the emerging patterns and consciously highlighting and omitting already established but exaggerated and superfluous patterns and best practices. His goal is to build an entire application with unit and integration tests as well as answer any questions from the audience.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAdam Bien\nConsultant and author Adam Bien is an Expert Group member for the Java EE 6 and 7, EJB 3.X, JAX-RS, and JPA 2.X JSRs.
