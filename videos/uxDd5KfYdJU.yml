title: 'Wholly Graal: Accelerating GPU Offload for Java'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784791
description: "GPU offload is an essential technique for accelerating complex parallelizable programs, but unfortunately it has been slow to penetrate the Java space because production JVMs lack support for GPU code generation. This session discusses a joint effort of the Sumatra OpenJDK project and the Graal OpenJDK project to prototype this support on top of Oracle’s HotSpot VM. The presentation includes an overview of Graal and its status, discusses the technical approach of adding a new compiler back end for GPU architectures, and includes a demonstration of producing and running HSAIL code with Graal.\n\n\nAuthors:\nVasanth Venkatachalam\nVasanth Venkatachalam is Senior Software Engineer at Advanced Micro Devices.\nView more trainings by Vasanth Venkatachalam at https://www.parleys.com/author/vasanth-venkatachalam\n\nChristian Wimmer\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Christian Wimmer at https://www.parleys.com/author/christian-wimmer\n\nChristian Thalinger\nChristian is a member of HotSpot Compiler team.\nView more trainings by Christian Thalinger at https://www.parleys.com/author/christian-thalinger\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
