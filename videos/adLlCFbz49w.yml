description: 'There are many tools you can use to create mobile apps with JavaScript; tools like Apache Cordova, Ripple, the Cordova CLI, emulators, and a myriad of JavaScript libraries. In the Visual Studio team, we set out to make app building using Cordova a little easier, curating a set of these tools for developers using a single development environment. In this session, I''ll walk you through the tool-chain and show you how we tied them all together using JavaScript and open source. You may discover a few new tools along the way and you''ll get some insight into how we combined pre-existing tools with unique capabilities.'
