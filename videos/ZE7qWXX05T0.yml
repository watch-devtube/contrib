description: "In this video, I go over some of the state of the art advances in music generation coming out of DeepMind. Then we build our own music generation script in Python using Tensorflow and a type of neural network called a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. Congrats to Rohan Verma (Winner) and Chih-Cheng Liang (runner-up) for their classifiers for scientists. The challenge for this video is to generate a happy/upbeat song using the RBM Script. \n\nThe code for this video is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Music_Generator_Demo\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nThe WaveNet blogpost with audio samples:\nhttps://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/\n\nMore on RBMs:\nhttp://deeplearning4j.org/restrictedboltzmannmachine.html\n\nAnother write up on music generation with Neural Networks:\nhttp://www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/\n\nInteresting Machine Music Generation Project by Google:\nhttps://magenta.tensorflow.org/welcome-to-magenta\n\nTensorFlow course on Udacity:\nhttps://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730\n\nRohan's Classifier (Winner):\nhttps://github.com/rhnvrm/galaxy-image-classifier-tensorflow\n\nChih-Cheng's Classifier (Runner-up):\nhttps://github.com/ChihChengLiang/tensorflow-night-heron-classifier\n\nPlease subscribe, like, and comment!
