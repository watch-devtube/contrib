title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2016 Tom Adams - Typed Services Using Finch'
language: English
recordingDate: 1465528702
description: "Finch is an open source HTTP library built on top of Finagle, the RPC framework that powers Twitter’s infrastructure. Finch is a great candidate to use when building services, and compares favourably to other popular frameworks in languages such as Ruby, Go, JavaScript, Elixir, Clojure and Haskell. This talk outlines the types of problems faced when building small services, and how using a good type system can help. I introduce & outline Finch, highlighting how it addresses these concerns. Throughout, a concrete example of an API built for a startup using Finch is used.\n\nPrior to Redbubble, Tom Adams was principal consultant at Cogent and co-founded and led development at Oomph. His current interests are in technical leadership, high performance & cloud computing and functional programming.\n\nFor more on YOW! Lambda Jam, visit http://lambdajam.yowconference.com.au"
