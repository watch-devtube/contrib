description: "At SSW, we love Angular. We had a lot of success on AngularJS, and have been building web applications for enterprises and large government projects since Angular 2 was in early Beta.\n\nPerformance, AOT, Code Splitting, Productivity, Building for Mobile and Desktop, .…. but there are so many options, and so many unanswered questions.\n\nThis session will de-mystify Angular, highlight the lessons we wish we hadn’t had to learn the hard way and show you what's new in Angular 4. We will teach you what you need to know but aren’t going to find out until you are too far into your project to turn around. You will learn the pitfalls to avoid when building Angular in production.\n\nCome and see why we are loving Angular for everything from startups to large enterprise applications."
