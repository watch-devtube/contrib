description: "What exactly is Red Hat up with CoreOS .....and what were they thinking when they announced a Fedora CoreOS? In this talk, we'll briefly look at some of the excellent work pioneered by the Container Linux team around the self-driving, container focused operating system. We'll also overlay how the container ecosystem has changed over the past 5 years and what we're doing at the OS-level to refocus and ultimately give users a better experience.\n\n\n\nBen Breard\n\nhttps://cfp.all-systems-go.io/en/ASG2018/public/events/232"
