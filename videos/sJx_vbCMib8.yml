description: "DOES18 Las Vegas - Back in the day – five to ten years ago – business applications were orchestrated with purpose built enterprise solutions owned and managed exclusively by IT Operations. Along comes the concept of DevOps and the SDLC transitions to the fully automated delivery pipeline you know today where everything is expected to be embedded into the code. Since developers know and love scripting, or cron or Jenkins or whatever automation tool they have access to, it became those tools they used to build their operational instrumentation and called it a day! How would DevOps folks react if you suggested they should manage their delivery pipeline with cron? Yeah, that’s how everyone should react to managing payroll or inventory or payments or any sophisticated business service with Jenkins or Puppet or Chef or ANY tool not purpose built for such functionality. Come to learn how PayPal, Amadeus and similar enterprises are orchestrating their critical business applications with a DevOps enabled, Jobs-as-Code approach.\n\nYou Wouldn’t Drive Kids to School in a Golf Cart.
