description: "When Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize for developing a new model of how the brain works, it changed how we think about thinking. If you haven't had time to read Kahneman's book 'Thinking Fast and Slow,' or even if you have, Linda will 'translate' the model and what it means for us in working better. We know that our jobs involve thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. We all want to do a better job of thinking fast and slow. Linda will help you get started with that.\n\nDevConf 2018 (http://devconf.pl)\n26-28 September 2018"
