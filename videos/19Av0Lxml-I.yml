description: "Who in their right mind would ever want to work with RDBMS anymore. Especially in JavaScript, where you can just call \"save\" on your JSON and turn it into web-scale BSON, or get to choose between so many levels of DB that we don't even know which to use. This will be a story about one person's journey to try and make people believe that Node can actually be a thing for boring, early-2000's era web applications using (gasp) SQL. It'll also share some discoveries along the way including how ACID / transactions can be super useful in the everything-async world of JavaScript, and some tips and tricks for keeping a sane and organized data layer when venturing into the abyss of hybrid single-page / server-rendered applications.\n\nTranscript: https://gist.github.com/voodootikigod/36d5eb51686805459bfa"
