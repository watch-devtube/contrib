description: "Which optimizer should we use to train our neural network? Tensorflow gives us lots of options, and there are way too many acronyms. We'll go over how the most popular ones work and in the process see how gradient descent has evolved over the years.\n\nCode from this video (with coding challenge):\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/The_evolution_of_gradient_descent/\n\nPlease subscribe!
