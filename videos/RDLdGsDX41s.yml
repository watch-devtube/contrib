description: "What is this HashGraph and will it really make blockchain obsolete? In this video I talk about the consensus algorithm that it uses, what the data structure looks like, and what the application specific use cases are. I want to stress that HashGraph is a private ledger, so of course its going to be more efficient in terms of transactions per second than Bitcoin or Ethereum. Its like comparing apples and oranges. There is a public version of HashGraph in the works, but in terms of bringing that kind of scalability to a public ledger, we'll just have to wait and see if its possible. This talk includes code, theory, and of course yours truly. Enjoy! \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/HashGraph_Explained\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
