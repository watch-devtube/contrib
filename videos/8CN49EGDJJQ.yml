recordingDate: 1437556123
description: "From the software development perspective Internet of Things (IoT) is about programming sensors, connecting them with each other and integrating them with existing business applications.\n\nWhile IoT-enabled devices can use a variety of proprietary software, RESTful Web services and OAUTH protocol play a role of a glue that allows to integrate multiple devices into an application workflow. This presentation will demonstrate a sample architecture of such an application. You’ll also see a live demo of using commercial consumer devices as a part of an application that utilizes REST API, OAuth, Websockets, JavaScript and Java. This presentation will give you an idea of how to authenticate users and integrate new IoT devices as they become available on the market."
