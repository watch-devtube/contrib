recordingDate: 1479295405
description: "The Free Software Movement campaigns for computer users' freedom to cooperate and control their own computing. The Free Software Movement developed the GNU operating system, typically used together with the kernel Linux, specifically to make these freedoms possible. Free software is the only way to stop your digital devices from directly snooping on you; however, digital surveillance uses other methods too, that must be stopped through political means in order for democracy to be possible.\n\nwww.istanbultechtalks.com"
