title: 'XP practices implementation for large product development team (Vladimir Nikonov, Ukraine)'
recordingDate: 1545238978
description: "We want to share our experience in implementing a wide range of XP practices within the generated product and how they influenced the development processes and the functional quality. We will:\n\n– compare the practices that gave the greater result and those that were less successful;\n– consider the difficulties in implementation at different stages and which solutions were applied;\n– describe what tools were chosen and what changes the platform underwent to enable the use of any of them in all development branches;\n– tell how and where we increased the competence in the use of different approaches and how we scale knowledge to the entire development department;\n– speak about the changes in the release of functionality processes and team work planning;\n– share our plans and impressions why, in our opinion, it is worth going through the hard way of XP transformations to anyone who is engaged in the software development."
