description: "Matthias is software engineer and author from Hamburg, Germany. After working with Scala for 2 years, he is now interested in Clojure.\n\nCurrently, he is writing a book about \"Building Systems in Clojure\".\n\n\nHis open source work can be found at:\n\nhttps://github.com/matthiasn\n\nBuilding a System in Clojure\n\nIn this talk I will present my BirdWatch project , a system I'm building in order to discover patterns for developing distributed applications for reasoning over streaming data in Clojure and ClojureScript. It also also the sample application in the book I'm currently working on: leanpub.com/building-a-system-in-clojure\nPrevious incarnations of this application have been in Scala with an AngularJS frontend, but I fell out of love with these technologies and have more fun with the Clojure ecosystem now."
