description: "We’ll talk about some of the more recently-released CSS tools you can use now! In this session, we’ll cover some of the hottest, flashiest, and most problem-solvingest CSS standards, their use cases, syntax, and situations where you shouldn’t use them. Even if some of these concepts are unfamiliar, or if you haven’t worked on the front-end in a while, this session is for you. You don’t need to use JavaScript to create sweet animations or columns that automatically fill the space - you can do it all with CSS! We’ll cover browser support and some fallbacks you can use to get you started using these new tools today.\n\nIn this session, you'll get an intro to:\n\nFlexbox\nCSS Grids\nPseudo elements (:before, :after, :nth-child)\nTransitions & Animations\nBlend Modes\nTextured Typography\nBrowser Support and Graceful Fallbacks for all of the above!\n\nEVENT:\n\nDrupalCon Nashville 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAlexis Findiesen\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ICxtqpdo_g"
