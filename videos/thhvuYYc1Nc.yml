description: "Beyond Batch\n\nhttp://strataconf.com/stratany2012/public/schedule/detail/26519\n\nHadoop started as an offline, batch-processing system. It made it practical to store and process much larger datasets than before. Subsequently, more interactive, online systems emerged, integrating with Hadoop. First among these was HBase, the key/value store. Now scalable interactive query engines are beginning to join the Hadoop ecosystem. Realtime is gradually becoming a viable peer to batch in big data."
