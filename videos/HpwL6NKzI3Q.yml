Taxify aggregates traditional taxi companies with a sleek user facing mobile app, that connects passengers to licensed taxis at the push of a button. This speech will cover a little bit of everything about Taxify's product engineering - who are our customers, how do we build the products, what's our engineering process and culture. We'll also take a look at what are the different challenges in building mobile apps, backoffice and real-time backend systems."
