description: 'You probably work on a distributed system. Even if you don''t yet face a serverless microservice architecture using fancy NoSQL databases, you might simply call some remote services via REST or SOAP. Welcome to a world without ACID transactions which leaves you in charge of dealing with difficult problems yourself e.g. eventual consistency, distributed transactions, compensation or message delivery semantics like "exactly-once". In this talk, I’ll briefly describe why this will become the new normal and which challenges arise for us as developers. I will discuss strategies to deal with it and present real-life experiences, recipes, patterns and frameworks. Expect fun little live hacking sessions with Open Source components like Spring, Hystrix, Kafka and Camunda.'
