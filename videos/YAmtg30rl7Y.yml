description: "Chris Bailey, Chief Architect, Cloud Native Runtimes, IBM UK Ltd\n\nAlthough Java has been the historical leader for enterprise web application development, the power of full-stack development is driving massive growth of the use of Node.js for web development, by enabling developers to write end-to-end applications in JavaScript. Does this mean that Java is the next COBOL and is being consigned to running legacy back-end applications? Several emerging application architectures are increasingly multilanguage, utilizing microservices to use the best language for each component. This session compares the characteristics of Node.js, Java, and other languages, shows their complementary characteristics, and highlights how they are being used to build the next generation of web applications."
