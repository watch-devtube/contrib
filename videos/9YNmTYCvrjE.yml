description: "Want to do some embedded software? Or worse, did you get handed a project and just want to know what is going on? There are some concepts you'll need to understand: volatile variables, hardware registers, static keywords, memory maps, bit manipulation and function pointers, oh my! This webcast walks step-by-step through the most important concepts a software engineer will need to get started on the path to embedded systems.\n\nAbout Elecia White:\n\nElecia White has worked on DNA scanners, inertial measurement units for airplanes and race cars, toys for preschoolers, a gunshot location system for catching criminals, and assorted other medical and consumer devices.\n\nShe is the founder of Logical Elegance, an embedded systems consulting company based in San Jose. Elecia has developed strong skills in signal processing, hardware integration, complex system design, and performance. Having been through FAA and FDA certification processes, she understands the importance of producing quality designs and how they lead to quality implementations.\n\nElecia has spent several years in management roles but enjoys hands-on engineering and the thrill of delivering excellent products. While continuing to provide leadership and mentoring, she prefers to focus on the technical aspects of a project. A graduate of Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA, Elecia enjoys sharing her passion for science, engineering and interesting gizmos, particularly how these things can make the world a better place.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
