We thought it would be a great idea to share this keynote as part of the AI Show. In this keynote, Eric Boyd shows us what makes Azure AI great for developers, gives behind the scenes stories, and teaches how you can get started with AI today.\n\nSome helpful resources:\n\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show (https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show?ocid=AID2463683&wt.mc_id=ai-c9-sejuare)\n\nCreate a free account on Azure!
