recordingDate: 1476803950
description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nThis is the first part of the introduction to actors. Here we will cover only the negative side of actors. This presentation is complemented by a workshop which teaches 'proper' actor development. We will be debunking some common myths about the actor model. This talk is intentionally polemical and presents only one side of the story."
