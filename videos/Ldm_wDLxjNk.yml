description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nI find a program much more valuable when I can read it and understand the abstractions that collectively explain a theory of the problem and solution. In contrast, I find programs with minimal abstractions and lots of conditional logic hard to understand because there is little or no theory to be inferred. \n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers.org/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/wearedevs/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearedevelopers.org/"
