title: 'YOW! West 2016 James White - Design 101 for Programmers'
recordingDate: 1468844097
description: "Many developers at small companies, and most indies, don’t have the luxury of collaborating with genuine beret-wearing, latte-sipping designers. But never fear! There are at least 23 weird tricks you can learn to avoid your app looking like it was designed by a developer. After twenty years of designing for print, and six years making mobile apps, James White is probably still a better designer than he is a developer (although some might say that isn’t saying much). In this session he’ll talk about branding, colour, iconography, typography, whitespace, and the holy trinity of aesthetics, functionality and usability. Expect pretty slides, and to leave with a notebook full of tiny but useful tidbits of advice.\n\nJames is a mobile app designer and developer. He directs Reach Health Promotion Innovations, a Perth company providing mobile development services to public health organisations across Australia, and recently completed a PhD examining the use of socially connected apps for health behaviour change. James also provides contract mobile app design services, via Colourfool Creative. James has twice received an Apple scholarship to attend the World Wide Developers Conference in San Francisco.\n\nFor more on YOW! West, visit http://west.yowconference.com.au"
