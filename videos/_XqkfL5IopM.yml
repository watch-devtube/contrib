Rolling out big scale heterogeneous applications has just started. This talk is about real customer projects, which use docker to deploy applications in a rapidly environment changing by kubernetes and CoreOS. We followed a very strict approach, separating persistent and stateless applications and run everything in small units orchestrated by Kubernetes. With our own tools we could create descriptions of environments very rapidly, creating full complex environments with a single command. Examples in Java, Python and Ruby are shown. Security has been addressed to pass an extensive security audit. Using the latest feature of systemd on Linux on CoreOS, we could move the configuration management into the kubernetes domain."
