title: 'Cognitive biases in software development - Ian Hughes'
recordingDate: 1572518865
description: "Our brains have evolved over millions of years to help us function in a complicated and crazy world, but the heuristics of our ancestors can sometimes give rise to unfortunate beliefs and behaviours that don’t correlate to the world we live in today.\n\nAs a software consultant, part of my role is helping teams and customers to understand the problems they’re trying to solve and how best to solve them. Throughout my career I have seen and fallen into many of these common cognitive biases and helped myself and others to try to negate them.\n\nIn this talk I will explore the most common biases I’ve seen in software development teams and how we can build practices and think our way out of these misconceptions.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
