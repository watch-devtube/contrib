description: 'In the era of third party cloud service providers where enterprise critical data is hosted and shared with various vendors, third party security reviews have become essential part of Information Security. It has become a challenge for security teams to ensure parity is maintained between security controls that are available on premise, to those offered by the cloud provider. Typically, companies send a word document or excel sheet to get answers from cloud providers, however, this process is done only once and the review is point in time. In this talk, the attendees will learn about various methods of identifying security posture of the third-party cloud service using information available on Internet, how to use this information for performing cloud service review and improve their own cloud offerings. This can also supplement the tedious questionnaire process and provide an option to fast track the vendor reviews.'
