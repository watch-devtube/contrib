description: "Kubernetes Scalability: A Multi-Dimensional Analysis - Shyam Jeedigunta & Maciek Różacki, Google \n\n‘How much do our clusters scale?’ has been of interest to the developer and user communities of kubernetes for a long time. This is super important if you want to better understand how to architect your workloads by understand where are the bottlenecks of the system.

We will then illustrate limits that are currently known to us through scale-testing experiments and user experiences. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrXy"
