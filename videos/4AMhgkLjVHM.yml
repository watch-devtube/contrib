description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nRian Quinn's \"Making C++ and the STL Work in the Linux/Windows Kernels\" from CppCon 2016 showed the difficulty of making C++ code work correctly in kernel mode. For some real-time systems, though, developing C++ applications that run in kernel mode \"just works\" as most of the necessary runtime support for Modern C++ is already available. Platform limitations, though, can offset the development gains that come with easy access to hardware.\n\nThis talk will present a variety of issues — such as limited filesystem functionality, missing memory protection, limited debugging and performance monitoring tools, and constrained resources — that impact usage of standard C++ functionality and require additional due diligence on the part of the developer. Topics will include testing in user mode; kernel-mode exceptions; and programming the Intel performance monitoring hardware.\n— \nBilly Baker: FlightSafety International, Senior Staff Software Engineer\n\nBilly Baker has developed deterministic real-time flight simulation software using C++ for FlightSafety International, Evans and Sutherland and Boeing since 1997. At C++ committee meetings, he can most likely be found in LWG. He received his B.S. and M.S in Applied Mathematics from the University of Tulsa and is currently working on a Ph.D. in Computer Science. If asked, he will tell stories from his research semester at NCSA when web browsers did not yet have forms support.Website: http://www.flightsafety.com\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
