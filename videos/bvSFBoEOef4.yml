description: "A programmer or hacker hobbyist relies on their shell environment to provide shortcuts to commonly-faced situations. Shell environments like Bash allow for command aliasing, function that can take arguments, and full-on scripts. This environment is always changing and is generally ubiquitous for many.\n\nYour shell environment should be version controlled with Git. Version control will allow you to track your environment changes and bring them with you wherever you go.\n\nIn this session I will walk through a few approaches to managing your Linux shell environment in Git and point out the benefits and drawbacks with each technique. We will finish with techniques for sharing your Linux shell environment with others.\n\nAnthony Bargnesi\n\nSelventa\n\nAnthony Bargnesi is a software engineer with Selventa, a biomarker discovery company, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He is the lead engineer on the open source OpenBEL platform.\n\nAnthony has been working with Java technologies for ten years. He is an advocate and contributor to open source."
