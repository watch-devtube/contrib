description: "Web APIs are everywhere, at every corner of the web. To be \"hip,\" let’s stick to REST. For even more hype, what can we do with the Groovy programming language and RESTful web APIs? This session covers APIs, how Groovy and REST services interact, and how to test such APIs with the Spock testing framework to be \"enterprisey.\" Along the way, you’ll find out about other interesting tools and libraries for facilitating this interaction with web APIs.\n\nSpeaker:\nGuillaume Laforge, Product Ninja and Advocate at Restlet, Restlet\nAt Restlet, Guillaume Laforge is taking care of the Product Leadership around the APISpark API management platform, the Restlet Studio for crafting Web APIs and the Restlet Framework for authoring restful applications. He is also leading the Developer Advocacy team, to interact with developers using those projects. Since 2003, Guillaume has been involved in the Groovy programming language project, leading the project since about 2004, and working on it under the umbrella of G2One (our Groovy/Grails startup), then SpringSource, VMware, and the Pivotal spin-off. He is also a frequent conference speaker presenting Groovy, Grails, Gaelyk, Domain-Specific Languages at JavaOne, GR8Conf, SpringOne2GX, QCon, and Devoxx, among others.
