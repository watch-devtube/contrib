description: "Serverless computing and FaaS (Function as a Service) are the new blacks! They radically change how software is organized, deployed, and charged for, and is in the process of further disrupting the still-evolving world of cloud computing.\n\nThis hands-on session will introduce you to 'Fn Project' (http://fnproject.io), a new open source serverless platform, which features a code-first approach to building polyglot applications. We will discuss Fn Flow, a CompletionStage like API, used to compose multiple functions into meaningful applications. No flow-charts, no exoteric stuff, just plain readable and testable (Java) code! And although 'Fn Project' is polyglot, this session will focus mostly on the Java and Kotlin side of it."
