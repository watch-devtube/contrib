description: "We've built web interfaces roughly the same way for years: with a few HTML tags, some arcane CSS, and a whole lotta crossed fingers for luck.\nFortunately, a better way is on the horizon, and it promises to revolutionize the way UIs are designed. In this session, you'll learn how to use Scalable Vector Graphics to modernize your web UIs without sacrificing the code-based workflows you're used to, and bring a touch of the future to your apps along the way."
