title: 'MongoDB + CredHub = Secure By Default Data Services on PCF'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538631155
description: "Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) has evolved into the most secure platform to run both applications and data services. In order to demonstrate that being secured is not hard, i.e. 'even a caveman can do it', we'll step into a developer's shoes and walk through a PCF application that binds to MongoDB securely. As awestruck witnesses, we'll take a peek behind the curtain. Attendees will learn that although having MongoDB On-Demand to empower our developers, security standards are hard. But it doesn't have to be so, CredHub is the solution to providing managed, secured credentials and certificates. Fear no more, MongoDB with CredHub brings us an out of box secured experience from data to the application.\n\nSpeakers:\nPeter Blum\nPlatform Architect, Pivotal\n\nDiana Esteves\nSenior Consulting Engineer, MongoDB\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
