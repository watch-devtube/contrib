recordingDate: 1285866751
description: "Presented by Alasdair Allan. The iPhone has quickly become one of the primary interface devices for geographically tagged data, and underlying geo-location on the iPhone and iPad devices is the Core Location framework. The framework is of the most powerful and elegant included as part of the iPhone SDK, abstracting the heavy lifting of determining the users location away from you as a developer.\n\nThis webcast discusses how to use both the CoreLocation and MapKit frameworks to build map-based applications on the iPhone platform. It talks you through how to build, embed and annotate maps directly into you iPhone applications. We then go ahead and build a simple application which finds and continuously updates the user's location on a map, while simultaneously displaying the user's current latitude, longitude and current heading."
