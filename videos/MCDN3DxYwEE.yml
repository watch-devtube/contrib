description: "http://strataconf.com/strata2014/public/schedule/detail/33712\n\nOur legacy information architecture is not able to cope with the realities of today's business. This is because it is not able to scale to meet our SLAs due to separation of storage and compute, economically store the volumes and types of data we currently confront, provide the agility necessary for innovation, and most importantly, provide a full 360 degree view of our customers, products, and business. In this talk Dr. Amr Awadallah will present the Enterprise Data Hub (EDH) as the new foundation for the modern information architecture. Built with Apache Hadoop at the core, the EDH is an extremely scalable, flexible, and fault-tolerant, data processing system designed to put data at the center of your business."
