description: "JFrog is handling a huge amount of binary files for all of its customers. Because each customer has its own space and domain, using a global object store can be tricky. Also JFrog’s application cannot work with  eventually consistent  storage and cannot meet customer requirements with current S3 performance. Learn in this session how JFrog managed fast upload, critical replication and backups, and global download availability of the terabytes of customer binary files.\n\n\nAuthors:\nBaruch Sadogursky\nBaruch Sadogursky (a.k.a JBaruch) is the Developer Advocate of JFrog, the creators of Artifactory Binary Repository, the home of Bintray, and JavaOne 2011 Duke Choice Awards winner.
