title: 'Bare Metal In The Cloud: Isn’t it Ironic? Explaining OpenStack bare metal provisioning service'
language: English

description: "by Dmitry Tantsur and Ilya Etingof\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2213/vai_bare_metal_in_the_cloud.webm\n\n\nWith IaaS, common way to provide compute resources is to ask the hypervisor to allocate a bunch of VMs for you. Sometimes, however, allocating a bare metal machine could be essential to withstand higher workloads or harden data security. Running a container engine (like k8s) inside of a bare metal machine avoids double resource management and achieves higher density. \n\nIn this talk we will introduce the OpenStack project called Ironic - the bare metal provisioning and life cycle service that can also act as a hypervisor for the OpenStack compute service.. We will explain system design, typical hardware management workflow, upcoming features and future challenges. \n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 12:30:00+01"
