description: "Gerrit Grunwald, Senior Software Engineer, Karakun AG\n\nEverybody knows boring form-based user interfaces. What if you could add mobile devices to improve the UX of desktop or web applications? A research project at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland has tried to address this topic in a totally different way. Usually you would expect to rework the UI and make it fancier, but here the idea is to enhance controls so they can reside on a mobile device. For example, you can think about a text input field that gets the focus, with the actual data input being done on a mobile phone. This session presents an overview of the concept and shows you some results of the research project in the form of demos based on Swift, JavaFX, and Polymer."
