recordingDate: 1445442467
description: "Justin Leitgeb: This talk will start by defining high assurance as it is used in\nthe software industry, and why full-stack developers should care about such a concept. Rather than focusing on academic principles, this talk will give concrete examples of how several types of “high assurance” software practices can lead to reduced software costs and more predictable development timelines. \n\nThe talk will include: Introduction to expressive types, as present in Haskell. Dependent types, as found in languages such as Idris. Proof-carrying code, as can be created in systems such as Coq. At the end of the presentation, programmers in the audience should have a better idea of advanced software tools and techniques that may warrant further investigation in order to produce systems with reduced cost and better results.\n\nhttp://forwardjs.com"
