title: 'Managing your Black Friday Logs - David Pilato'
recordingDate: 1535528809
description: "Monitoring an entire application is not a simple task, but with the right tools it is not a hard task either. However, events like Black Friday can push your application to the limit, and even cause crashes. As the system is stressed, it generates a lot more logs, which may crash the monitoring system as well. In this talk I will walk through the best practices when using the Elastic Stack to centralize and monitor your logs. I will also share some tricks to help you with the huge increase of traffic typical in Black Fridays.\nTopics include:\n\n* monitoring architectures\n* optimal bulk size\n* distributing the load\n* index and shard size\n* optimizing disk IO\n\nTakeaway: best practices when building a monitoring system with the Elastic Stack, advanced tuning to optimize and increase event ingestion performance."
