description: "Many people don't care about security. It's OK, don't worry! I'm not judging.\n\nSecurity is the world of defense, of caution and of risk. Securing systems is hard and we don't have great solutions to the many challenges it poses. Security folk on the whole are the least exciting people to invite to your parties.\n\nThe time has come to change this.\n\nSo what if we accept that our systems can never be 100% secure and try to go fast? Really fast?\n\nCan we weave security through our software development world in a way that protects us, detects issues quickly and actually helps us move at speed? Let me show you how security can look when it stops being about fear and starts being a tool for building the amazing systems of the future."
