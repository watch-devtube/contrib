description: "Cloud Native Transformation - Pavel Nikolov & Matt Hope, Fairfax Media \n\nThis is a story about a 185-year-old publishing company which goes through cloud native transformation. In less than a year the team manages to switch from releasing their monolith monthly to releasing their microservices many times a day. Pavel will describe the process of adopting more than half of the CNCF incubating projects, creating hundreds of Kubernetes namespaces in multiple clusters, while ensuring excellent automation and observability practices. And with all this, the vast majority of developers in the team do not need to use kubectl, helm or anything other than git and chat bots. Damian will talk about what this transformation means for the business and how it affects the company culture. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/Grb7"
