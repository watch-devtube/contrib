description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nIntro: Thanos: Scale Your Prometheus Monitoring With Ease - Xiang Dai, Huawei \n\nThanos is an open-source CNCF Sandbox project that builds upon Prometheus components to create a global-scale highly available monitoring system. It seamlessly extends Prometheus in a few simple steps and it is already used in production by dozens of companies that aim for high multi-cloud scale for metrics while keeping low maintenance cost. During this talk, Xiang Dai, maintainer of Thanos will explain basic concepts behind the project, its use cases, and tradeoffs. You will learn where to start and how to quickly deploy Thanos on Kubernetes without impacting your existing Prometheus setup. This talk is recommended for beginners that want to know more about running highly available Prometheus setup at scale with potentially unlimited metric retention with the lowest possible effort and cost. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cpAS"
