description: "Server-side JavaScript on the Java Virtual Machine\r\nSteve Yegge (Google)\r\n\r\nAfter over a decade in the browser space, JavaScript is making a surprise move into the server programming space. Mozilla Rhino is turning JavaScript into a compelling option for Java programmers. Will JavaScript be the next server-side programming language?
