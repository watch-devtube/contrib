description: "Grace Nolan\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/91/\nWith more and more students learning computer science in schools, how can we encourage participation in OSS projects? \r\n\r\nThis talk is adapted from a research project Grace completed while at University investigating gender parity in Computer Science. Grace will share her findings on the student environment at university and how it relates to open source projects. She will then open the conversation up to discuss ideas on how to create a rich petri dish for prospective contributors from diverse backgrounds.\r\n\r\nShe will present to you a vision of the future; a reality check; and finally, a discussion of ideas to help us make that vision a reality."
