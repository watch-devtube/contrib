title: 'Deep Learning with CNTK and F# - Mathias Brandewinder'
recordingDate: 1535365842
description: "Deep Learning is a powerful and mysterious sounding Machine Learning technique. It is based on neural networks, and has shown impressive results in areas as different as computer vision, speech recognition, or automated language translation. And, with the recent release of the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) .NET API, it is now possible to train and use deep learning models in .NET.\nIn this talk, we will introduce some of the ideas behind the approach, explain how it works behind the scenes, and demonstrate how F# makes it easy to learn models from data and used them from within your .NET code."
