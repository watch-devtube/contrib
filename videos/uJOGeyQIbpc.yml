description: "We spend all our days striving to write the perfect code, code that is well thought out and will stand the test of time.\nThis is not a talk about that code. This is a talk about all that code you don't write because it's stupid, it doesn't solve a \"real\" problem or doesn't make any sense.\n\nWe'll explore some of my own stupid ideas, like writing my own number system in .NET or writing an IoC container in JavaScript, what I learnt from these stupid ideas and why exploring stupidity is important."
