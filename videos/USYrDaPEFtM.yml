description: "Jody Mulkey, Chief Technology Officer, Ticketmaster\n\nAs the largest live event ticketing company in the world, Ticketmaster is in the rare position of having to balance the needs of a multi-billion dollar global business with the need to defend against competitors that are hungry and very agile. Powered by legacy systems, it’s clear that Ticketmaster can’t rest on it’s laurels and must innovate to maintain it’s market leadership.\n\nBut how do you take such a large, mission critical enterprise service and make it nimble enough to compete with competitors and delight our customers?\n\nWhen Live Nation and Ticketmaster merged 5-years-ago, the executive leadership team had the vision to commit to re-architecting Ticketmaster’s 39-year old ticketing platform. While this is an incredibly exciting prospect and will lead to industry changing innovation, it does create huge challenges for Ticketmaster’s Global Technical Operations team. As with any long lived enterprise, the “muscle memory” around managing, developing and delivering our service is very well formed. Changing habits is hard and in the high stakes game of selling tickets it is fraught with risk, both perceived and real."
