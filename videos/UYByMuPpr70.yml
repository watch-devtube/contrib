The call stack may consist of a limited amount of address space, often determined at the start\n of the program. The size of the call stack depends on many factors, including the programming language, machine architecture, multi-threading, and amount of \navailable memory. When a program attempts to use more space than is available on the call stack (that is, when it attempts to access memory beyond the call stack's\n bounds, which is essentially a buffer overflow), the stack is said to overflow, typically resulting in a program crash.\nIn this video we will see Stack Overflow as use case of MapReduce Design Patterns.\n\n\nRelated Blog : http://www.edureka.co/blog/tailored-big-data-solutions-using-mapreduce-design-patterns?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=webinar&utm_campaign=stackover-mapreduce-design\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would\nprefer a hassle free and self paced learning environment, accessible from any part of the world.\n\nThe topics related to Stack Overflow have extensively been covered in our course 'MapReduce Design Patterns’.\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India: +91-8880862004"
