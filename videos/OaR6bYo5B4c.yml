description: "Speaker: Ben Marks, Magento\n\nWhile many things (Composer, PSR compliance, MVC, API layer, and test coverage) about Magento 2 will feel familiar to modern PHP developers, what better way to dig into how the framework works than by building a module? This live coding exercise demonstrates both Magento's modular architecture and its plugin system for customizing core behavior.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nBen is a voting representative in the PHP FIG and has more than 10 years in open source commerce working with some of the biggest brands. He serves as an educator and mentor for Magento, having trained hundreds of developers directly as well as thousands of others through the Magento U Fundamentals series. He's always excited to meet other developers to talk about and learn from the challenges and successes of building successful commercial sites with PHP.\n\nEvent Page: https://2018.phpconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/lcAh/"
