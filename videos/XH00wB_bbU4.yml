description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nScientists and Developers want the same thing: a simple code that does exactly what it should. For the former, it implies adhering to their knowledge base and domain idioms. For the latter, it means it compiles in a reasonable time frame and without bugs. for both, it better computes fast in the end. One way developers, especially in C++, provides scientists with usable libraries is to design them as Embedded Domain Specific Languages. Alas, in all honesty, if someone asked the Scientists, they will probably state that LaTex is *the* perfect DSLs they practice every day.\n\nThis is an old story and even if we only focus on matrix-based libraries, the current landscape of high-performance computing library -- Blaze, Blitz++, EIGEN, Armadillo, etc... -- is proof that those techniques have a decent public following. This is the point where the icky things start: stories of meta-programming, so-called expression templates and their uphill battle against new C++ features: interaction with auto, rvalue-references, move semantics and so on. The authors have spent quite a bit of their coding life trying to play with or around those techniques and this talk is about what they learned during this journey.\n\nThis talk will focus on what kind of mistakes, oversights and traps the old kind of scientific EDSLs fell into. We will investigate why the new C++ features didn't help them but pushed them further into a state of ever-growing complexity. We will present our vision of how a modern-C++ friendly EDSL for science can be built. By starting from scratch, this talk will cover the actual requirements of such a library including move-aware expression templates, symbolic formula building, type/value maps, named parameters and static visitors. As a conclusion, we will scheme over various immediate benefits of such an EDSL and new applications that old style libraries could not handle like symbolic simplification, automatic analytical derivation and more.\n— \nJoel Falcou\nLRI - Université paris 11\nassistant professor\nParis Area, France\n\nJoel Falcou is an assistant professor at the University Paris-Sud andresearcher at the Laboratoire de Recherche d'Informatique in Orsay, France. His researches focus on studying generative programming idioms and techniques to design tools for parallel software development. The two main parts of those works are : exploration of Embedded Domain Specific Language design for parallel computing on various architectures and the definition of a formal framework for reasoning about meta-programs and prove their compile-time correctness. Applications range from real-time image processing on embedded architectures to High Performance Computing on multi-core clusters.

His main scientific interests are related to cosmology and general relativity. He his particularly interested in the study of relativistic effects at cosmological scales using high performance simulations run on supercomputers. Because these simulations rely on tree data structures, he started investigating ways to optimize them. He now leads a research team working on tree data structures with main applications in simulations, machine learning, and data science. He also participates into the C++ standardization process and regularly submits proposals to improve the C++ language.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
