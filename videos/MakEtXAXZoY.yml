This year’s highlights were the news that Erlang will be Apache 2.0 licensed starting the next release and José Valim winning the ‘Erlang User of The Year’ award. If you missed the event, don’t worry! The videos and slides will be up on the website shortly. We also uploaded some photos here.\nIf you’re already thinking about next year’s Erlang User Conference, mark 15 and 16 September in your calendar right now!"
