description: "Digital event data (or click-stream data) is the collective record of users’ interactions with a website or other application. With the growing popularity of collecting this data has come waves of hype about particular approaches and tools for processing and analysing it. From spreadsheets, to dynamic reporting tools, to data warehouses, to massively parallel architectures to real time processing. Which processing approach is right for you?\n\nAs for any data system, the collection of digital event data is fundamentally about supporting, or even completely automating, our decisions and this has important implications for how it is processed. This presentation will examine some of these core considerations in formulating an approach to the processing of this data. What decisions does it support? Who uses the data? And increasingly importantly, as users become more aware of the value exchange for the data they provide, how to ensure that this data ultimately provides for a better service?\n\nSarah joined the ABC in 2015 as Senior Data Scientist to help build capability in advanced analytics and machine learning in the ABC’s Digital Network. Since joining she has helped the ABC’s digital product managers develop deeper understanding of their audiences and she has worked in the development of new audience facing, data-driven services. Prior to that, Sarah has worked to apply analytical methods and statistical models in various fields including genetic research, the optimisation of health services and digital and marketing analytics. Sarah has a BSc (Hons) degree from the Australian National University in Mathematics and Computer Science.\n\nFor more on YOW! Data, visit http://data.yowconference.com.au"
