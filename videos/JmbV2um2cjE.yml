description: "Dan Lüdtke, eGym.com\n\nWe own over a hundred different domains. They were spread over multiple registrars. DNS servers were not under active management and DNS data was neither version controlled nor reviewed. Deployments were risky and rollbacks challenging.\n\nWe gained control over the situation by reducing the number of contracts with registrars, selecting a cloud-based DNS service, and convinced the teams to manage DNS data in a version-controlled manner. To deploy DNS changes, we build tooling that we open-sourced. Today, we are able to deploy much faster and safer. We also have automated checks and implemented some safety measures to prevent the most common mistakes I made in the past. Sharing the mistakes will be part of the presentation, as well as quick outlook to the new automation options we unlocked by having a more robust DNS setup.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
