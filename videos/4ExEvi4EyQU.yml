description: "This talk was recorded at CukenFest London 2018\n\nhttp://cukenfest.cucumber.io/\n\nWe’re just two gals who like to write Gherkin. As quality managers at an agile software agency, we’ve devised and refined a process for collaborative cucumber testing done by the trifecta (3 amigos) involving product managers, developers, and quality managers. Working together, quality managers and product managers can encourage BDD and TDD best practices by throwing out everything they know (and probably hate) about traditional feature story writing, and baking Gherkin scenarios directly into the vegetable pie,  the project tracking tool of choice. From there, pop it into the oven (code repository of choice) and watch your test coverage bake to a golden hue.\n\nPlease join us as we talk through our process for writing Gherkin as quality managers and working to increase collaboration between product management and developers, with the cherry on top being the increase of awareness of BDD best practices across Originate projects."
