description: "Mitchell Tilbrook, Mobile Developer\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING YOUR DESIGNER'S, AND VECTOR GRAPHICS\n\nHave you ever had you're a designer give you SVGs that just don't render correctly? UI performance decrease since moving to vector icons from PNG? There are lots of things that can cause lower performance when drawing android vector drawables. The cause of all of them is a lack of communication. Designers know how to create beautiful and marvelous icons. What they might not know how Android works with vectors, limitation of the format and performance characteristics. \nIn this talk, we will look at some of the common mistakes both developers and designer make when moving to vector drawables. How you can retroactively correct common problems when converting an SVG to vector XML, and how you can effectively communicate with your designer to reduce bouncing back and forth."
