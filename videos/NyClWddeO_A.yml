description: "Slides: http://dl.2ality.com/2012/10/jsconf.pdf\n\nAfter giving a brief overview of JavaScript inheritance basics, this talk delves into advanced topics and answers questions such as the following ones:\n\nWhat is the difference between constructor inheritance and instance inheritance?\nWhat is the property `constructor` about?\nHow does the `instanceof` operator really work?\nHow does one reference a super-property in JavaScript?\nWhat is the `__proto__` property? Does it have a future?\nWill JavaScript ever have classes? How would they work?\nHow do I implement a type via an object instead of via a constructor function?\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
