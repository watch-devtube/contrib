description: "Speaker: Akshat Choudhary\n\nWhat does disaster look like to a WordPress plugin developer? It’s never fun to find out the hard way. This talk will be in the form of a few short stories about one disaster my company (BlogVault) faced recently: a major plugin vulnerability. I’ll be telling you what we did when more than 1000 of our customers got hacked overnight through our plugin… and how we recovered. Although this was one of the most harrowing experiences in the history of the company, it taught us quite a few lessons:\n\nAct fast\nMinimize damage, fix the root cause. Communicate, communicate, communicate\nBe honest & clear with your team, partners, and customers about your next steps. Be prepared for curveballs\nNot everything can be planned. Forgive delays and mistakes. Fix everything\nYou don’t know what’s broken (for sure). Reinforce it all. What happened when?\nStressful times call for simple measures. Note down what happened (and when). It’ll help with communications. Eliminate doubt.\nOur internal tool helped us identify signs of malware from 200,000 sites, but we also needed reaffirmation. What not to do when you face such a disaster: Panic\nThis only makes everything worse. Shy away from the truth\nWhether your customers or partners leave isn’t up to you. Your company’s integrity is. Focus inwards only\nYour business is about your customers, who are having a tough time. Help them first. The Ultimate Takeaway: Reach out to the community. Lots of people have been in the same situation.\n\nEvent Page: https://2017.singapore.wordcamp.org/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/crpJ/"
