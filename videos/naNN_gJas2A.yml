description: "Did you ever want to create an application that is never down? Have you ever been jealous of those Erlang guys, that produce applications that practically never fail? Have you tried Erlang and fled because of its baroque syntax and tooling?\n\nEnter Elixir!\n\nElixir combines Ruby's love for programmers with the absolute power that is the Erlang platform.\n\nThis talk will introduce Java programmers to Elixir and OTP. You will gain an understanding of what Elixir brings to the table and how to build highly scale-able systems with a toolset that is actually fun to use.\n\nEven if you will never use Elixir and OTP for you projects, you will learn some of the concepts, that make Erlang into such a powerful ecosystem.\n\nDavid Schmitz\nPricinpal architect at Senacor Technologies with a history of + 13 years of working in various projects using a bunch of different stacks and environments.\n\nCurrent focus is on migrating architectures and organizations, such that our customers can cope with the challenges of the digital age.\n\n[XYK-5936]"
