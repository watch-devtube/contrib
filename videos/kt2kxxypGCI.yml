description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nBringing Cloud Native Buildpacks to Kubernetes - Dr Nic Williams, Stark & Wayne \n\nApplications deployed to Kubernetes will live for next 10 years. The Dockerfile might be useful for an initial developer to get their application compiled into an OCI and deployed to Kubernetes, but over the next 10 years many different parts of the organisation will want to fix, upgrade, and audit the applications.\n\nInstead of Dockerfile, we will investigate the Cloud Native Buildpack (incubator) project that is based on the last 10 years of success at Heroku, and hundreds of Cloud Foundry installations around the world.\n\nBuildpacks provide automatic discovery of your applications' dependencies, the latest security patches, and are a homogenous method for all your organisation's application to be built into OCI/docker images over the next 10 years, and for all the running images to be upgraded without developer intervention.\n\nPlease, no more bespoke, unmaintained Dockerfiles."
