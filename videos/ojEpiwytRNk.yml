title: 'Algorithms for Data Management and Migration'
recordingDate: 1201171776
description: "Google Tech Talks\nJanuary, 23 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nI will describe some algorithms for addressing some fundamental optimization\nproblems that arise in the context of data storage and management. In the\nfirst part of the talk we will address the following question: How should\nwe store data in order to effectively cope with non-uniform demand for\ndata? How many copies of popular data objects do we need? Where should\nwe store them for effective load balancing?\n\nIn the second part of the talk we will address the issue of moving\ndata objects quickly, to react to changing demand patterns. We will\ndevelop approximation algorithms for these problems.\n\nThe first part of the talk is joint work with Golubchik, Khanna,Thurimella and Zhu. The second part is joint work with Kim and Wan.\n\nSpeaker: Samir Khuller\nSamir Khuller received his M.S and Ph.D from Cornell University in 1989\nand 1990, respectively. He spent 2 years as a Research Associate at the\nInstitute for Advanced Computer Studies at the University of Maryland,\nbefore joining the Computer Science Department in 1992, where he is a Professor\nand Associate Chair in the Department of Computer Science.\n\nHis research interests are in graph algorithms, discrete optimization, and\ncomputational geometry. He has published about 130 journal and conference\npapers, and several book chapters on these topics.\nHe received the National Science Foundation's Career Development Award,\nthe Dean's Teaching Excellence Award and also a CTE-Lilly Teaching Fellowship.\nIn 2003, he and his students were awarded the \"Best newcomer paper\" award for\nthe ACM PODS Conference. He received the University of Maryland's\nDistinguished Scholar Teacher Award in 2007."
