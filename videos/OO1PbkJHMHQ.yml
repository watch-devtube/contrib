description: "Do you care about your web application’s performance in production? The answer to that question is hopefully a clear  YES,  which leads to this question: How can you make sure you do not deploy changes to your production site that impair performance and scalability? Load tests might come to mind, but more often than not, these are run only rarely, not continuously throughout the development lifecycle. Wouldn’t it be great to detect scalability issues based on the automated tests you’ve already written? This session shows how you can measure relevant metrics such as the number of database statements or the number of calls to third-party services along your delivery pipeline, and it addresses common problem patterns you can identify and solve with those metrics.\n\n\nAuthor:\nWolfgang Gottesheim\nWolfgang Gottesheim has several years of experience as a software engineer and research assistant in the Java enterprise space.
