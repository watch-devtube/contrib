description: "What is architecture? What is an architect?\n\nIn my experience the definition of architecture and architect in software delivery is inconsistent at best and misleading at worst.\n\nI've come across a few different implementations of \"architect\". One that I find a lot is what I call an Architectologist. There is a certain type of organisation that has architectologists and their purpose is to solve a certain type of recurring problem. It is my belief that architectology is an antipattern.\n\nI'll explain what architectology is, where to look for it and why it is an anti pattern. Hopefully you'll enjoy the journey with me."
