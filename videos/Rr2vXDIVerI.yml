title: 'The ServiceWorker is coming, look busy! with Jake Archibald'
recordingDate: 1411355126
description: "The network is the web's bottleneck when it comes to first render. Most native apps use the network too, but the best ones give us something before they even try to reach out across the internet. Well, the ServiceWorker is coming to level the playing field. We'll look at how you can use ServiceWorker to manipulate caches of content to get on the screen as fast as a native app. We'll also take a look other native features the ServiceWorker enables.\n\nJake Archibald works in Google Chrome's developer relations team, working primarily on the ServiceWorker specification. He's a big fan of time-to-render optimizations, offline-first, progressive enhancement, and all of that responsive stuff."
