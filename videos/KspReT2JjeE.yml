description: "http://strataconf.com/strata2014/public/schedule/detail/33057\n\nWhile the first big data systems made a new class of applications possible, organizations must now compete on the speed and sophistication with which they can draw value from data. Future data processing platforms will need to not just scale cost-effectively; but to allow ever more real-time analysis, and to support both simple queries and today's most sophisticated analytics algorithms. Through the Spark project at Apache and Berkeley, we've brought six years research to enable real-time and complex analytics within the Hadoop stack."
