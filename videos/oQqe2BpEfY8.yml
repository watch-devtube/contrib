description: "This session’s speaker has never seen a job she didn’t want to automate. Sometimes it’s worked out well, but other times automation has turned a small nuisance into a big, fragile, free-time-eating monster nuisance. In this presentation, she explores why we automate, when to automate, the hazards of automation, and the (big) rewards of automation. She is part of the team developing IBM’s WebSphere Liberty application server. The team members have used a mix of off-the-shelf and home-rolled tools and processes to work smarter and more productively. She describes what they have learned as WebSphere has transitioned to DevOps and continuous delivery and why she still can’t resist trying to automate everything.\n\nSpeaker:\nHolly Cummins, Delivery Lead, WebSphere Liberty Profile, IBM\nHolly Cummins is the delivery lead for IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile. She is also a committer on the Apache Aries project. She is a co-author of Enterprise OSGi in Action and has spoken at Devoxx, QCon, JavaZone, The ServerSide Java Symposium, JAX London, GeeCon, and the Great Indian Developer Summit, as well as a number of user groups."
