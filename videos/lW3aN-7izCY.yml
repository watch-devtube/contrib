In this talk we'll look in detail at the Actuator, focusing on the new features including the new endpoint infrastructure that introduces support for Jersey and Web Flux alongside the existing support for Spring MVC. You'll leave this talk with a detailed understanding of the Actuator and armed with the knowledge required to develop your own endpoints."
