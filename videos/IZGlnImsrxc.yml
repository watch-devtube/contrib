Studiotime was then immediately featured in media outlets such as Forbes, BBC, HYPEBEAST, The FADER, Complex, Pigeons & Planes, and more. Studiotime went from an evening side project, MVP that generated over $10k+ revenue in months, and is now the largest online music studio marketplace in the world. \n\nCheck out part 2: https://youtu.be/xBasvuRUm4w\n\nResources shared in this video: \n\nSharetribe (Marketplace platform): http://bit.ly/2gXICOV \nSquarespace Logo: https://logo.squarespace.com \nProduct Hunt: https://www.producthunt.com \n\nLearn more about creator Mike Williams: http://www.iammikewilliams.com\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.com\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.com\n\nAnd subscribe for new videos on technology every day: https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=freecodecamp"
