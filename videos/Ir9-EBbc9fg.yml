description: "Programming with callbacks has been every JavaScript programmer's struggle since always. \"Callback hell\" is the reason why we have created Promises, Observables, reactive programming libraries, and other smart tools to help us avoid using callbacks directly. In this talk, we'll go beyond reactive programming and take a fresh look at callbacks. We will discover an incredible pattern among simple callbacks, that allows us to do everything that Observables or Promises or Iterables can do, and through familiar functional APIs. That pattern is fondly named \"Callbags\".\n\nEVENT:\n\nAmsterdam JSNation 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAndre Staltz\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nAmsterdam JS Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nJSNation YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQM428Hwrvxla8DCgjGONSQ"
