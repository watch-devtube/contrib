description: "With the pervasiveness of mobile technology and greater opportunities for crowd sourcing, it has become possible to integrate everything that moves on the planet into a geospatial framework. Using the web infrastructure, we can pull real-time observational information into our maps and distribute them with other data and services which can be openly discovered and made available to anyone for application development. These distributed maps become living maps that can be accessed anywhere, from any device. You can sketch on top of your living map, share it back to a server, and make it available to anyone so that they, in turn, can sketch on top of it. This allows us to move to the idea of collective geographic information.\n\nJack Dangermond\n\nEsri\n\nJack Dangermond is the founder and president of Esri.
