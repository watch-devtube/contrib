Passionate, observer and commentator on new media, custom advertising and everything that is related to new technologies and their application in building brand image and promotion of business and entrepreneurship. He keeps an extremely close eye on advertising campaigns, public relations activities, more or less successful viral shares, tracks word of mouth marketing, uses and tests most of the available social networking tools. He still does not know whether the advertisments lie or not.\n\nKamil Kozieł - Founder of IT School and PrezART as well as partner at ORA-600 and Stand-up Poland. Trainer with over 10 years of experience, effective manager and acclaimed speaker. As an orthodox proponent of creativity in the art of presenting, he uses tools and techniques reserved for actors or associated with stand-up comedians and always follows the rules of good design. Former lecturer at Warsaw School of Economics, WSB Schools of Banking, and University of Economics in Poznan. He worked for over 700 clients, whom he claims he loves more than his life. His career would not be what it is without: Unilever, Carlsberg and Man. One of the youngest member of Professional Speakers Association.\n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://www.instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
