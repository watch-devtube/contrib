description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nCompile times are a pain point for C++ programmers all over the world. Google is no exception.. We have a single unified codebase with hundreds of millions of lines of C++ code, all of it built from source. As the size of the codebase and the depth of interrelated interfaces exposed through textually included headers grew, the scaling of compiles became a critical issue. \n\nYears ago we started working to build technology in the Clang compiler that could help scale builds more effectively than textual inclusion. This is the core of C++ Modules: moving away from the model of textual inclusion. We also started preparing our codebase to migrate to this technology en masse, and through a highly automated process. It's been a long time and a tremendous effort, but we'd like to share where we are as well as what comes next. \n\nIn this talk, we will outline the core C++ Modules technology in Clang. This is just raw technology at this stage, not an integrated part of the C++ programming language. That part is being worked on by a large group of people in the ISO C++ standards committee. But we want to share how Google is using this raw technology internally to make today's C++ compiles faster, what it took to get there, and how you too can take advantage of these features. We will cover everything from the details of migrating a codebase of this size to use a novel compilation model to the ramifications for both local and distributed build systems. We hope to give insight into the kinds of benefits that technology like C++ Modules can bring to a large scale C++ development environment. \n— \nManuel Klimek\nGoogle\nSoftware Engineer\nManuel Klimek is a software engineer at Google since 2008 and a professional code monkey since 2003. After developing embedded Linux terminals for the payment industry and distributed storage technology at Google in C++, he decided that C++ productivity lags significantly behind other programming languages and set out to change this. He led the effort to grow Clang (http://clang.llvm.org) into a world class tooling platform for AST-based C++ tools and spearheaded large scale distributed semantic C++ code transformations both at Google and in the broader industry. Besides being sad that Germany lost against France in the Euro 2016, he is currently modularizing Google's internal C++ codebase and leading the development of the next generation of Clang-based C++ tools that range from editor based code completion to deep API refactorings.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
