description: "I'm not an Android developer by far, but I've been working in a mobile\ndevelopment team as the DevOps guy, which basically translates to do anything that\nis not related to development proper. When I was introduced to the team, they had\nhacked something on a Bamboo server, based on custom Python scripts that uploaded\nthe binaries to a Hockeykit server, completely decoupled from the Maven build and\nthe Nexus repository. The they decided to switch to Gradle... In this presentation,\nI will describe how I migrated from this situation to a standard build on a full-fledged\nJenkins server and more importantly the pain points I encountered regarding the\nprovisioning of Gradle , the updates of the Android SDK platforms, extras and repositories\nand the management of Robolectric behind the entreprise proxy."
