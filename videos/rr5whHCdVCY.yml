Impossible you say? “Everything is possible, even the impossible.” (- Mary Poppins)\n\nYour users care about how fast your app works. Learn how to load just what they need when they need it, adapt your user experience to low or no wifi, and experience what supercalifragilisticexpialidocious feels like. See how understanding user behavior and combining that with preloading strategies and RxJS can make a hugely positive impact on their user experience. You’ll never need a reason, never need a rhyme, when you make your app step in time.\nWatch all the ng-conf: Hardwired presentations/videos at https://videos.ng-conf.org\n\nng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.\n\nng-conf: Hardwired is brought to you by:\n- https://thinkster.io/ The best Angular and JavaScript tutorials on the web\n- https://herodevs.com/ Engineering and consulting by web development experts\n- https://xlts.dev/  Extended support for AngularJS\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
