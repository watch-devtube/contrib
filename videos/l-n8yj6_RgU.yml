description: "This is a talk about language design. It is also a talk about language implementation, and how the two go hand in hand. We've spent the past 5 years building Cypher for Neo4j, and have now opened it up for other vendors as well. This is the story of what we learned along the way so far.\n\nThis is a talk for anyone who is interested in learning about the things that are important to consider when designing a language for wide use.\n\nWe set out to build a language that was specialised while being expressive, a language where simple things are easy, and complex things possible. We desired a language that is easy to learn, with a straight path to mastery. We wanted a high level declarative language for which we could write a high performance implementation. We knew that we would make mistakes and needed a way to correct those, our language needed to be able to evolve while being reliable. We have not been very scientific about our process, but have still learned a lot along the way. In this talk we will share those learnings with you, so that you too can learn from our successes and mistakes.\n\nThis is not a story from an ivory tower, but a story about moving fast and breaking things. We never intended to build a language, but reluctantly found ourselves there anyway. With a small team and no budget we still produced something that a lot of people find very useful. We built something we are proud enough about to want to share the story of with the world."
