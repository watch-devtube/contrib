recordingDate: 1530788602
description: "Coding education has been a hot topic ever since the dawn of computing. Over the last decades we have seen an increase in creativity around how to bring programming to the masses, starting with BBC Micro in the 80s, and more recently with the launch of Raspberry Pi, MOOC platforms (massive open online course) and bootcamps. The panel discusses and explores these topics, with an emphasis on how viable these recent non-traditional developer education paths are, and how the landscape looks in 2018.\n\nModerator: \nRobert Axelsen, Web Developer at Sipwise\n\nPanelists:\nThomas Bachem, Founder & Chancellor at CODE University of Applied Sciences\nKathleen Mullaney, Vice President of Careers at Udacity\nMicael Holmström, CEO and Co-Founder of Academy\nMarwa El houasli, Founder of InspireHer\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”.
