description: "Tim Berners-Lee, credited as the inventor of the internet, defined a concept of linked data (HTTP + RDF) that defines how applications can use Web standards to build scalable applications that span a wide range of technology backgrounds and datasources. This approach has been successfully used across industries such as life sciences, government, and software development (OSLC). This session gives some background on the current state of linked data and an update on standardization activity at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) by IBM, Oracle, EMC, Fujitsu, and other companies.\n\n\nAuthor:\nSteve Speicher\nSteve Speicher is an IBM Senior Technical Staff Member who focuses on Rational change management solutions and integrations.
