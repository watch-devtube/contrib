description: "Internet of Things” (IoT) is a term to describe how physical objects are being connected to the Internet so that they can be monitored, controlled or interacted with. The problem arises when devices only work with respective standard or protocol which limits users choice of using various devices.\n\nThe future of connected devices should be more like the open web. The future should be decentralized, and should put the power and control into the hands of the people who use those devices. “Project Things” is an experimental framework of software and services to help developers connect “things” to the web in a safe, secure and interoperable way."
