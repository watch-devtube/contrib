description: "Kurt explores why a developer would want build an open source JavaScript runtime, how to go about it, and the interesting problems you can solve once you get the basics right. Devs who are never going to build a runtime will learn a bit about how they work, which will hopefully help them build better JS apps!\n\nEVENT:\n\ndotJS 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nKurt Mackey\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-1hXDvOoHA"
