description: "Bees are dying – in recent years an unprecedented decline in honey bee colonies has been seen around the globe. The causes are still largely unknown. At CSIRO, the Global Initiative for Honey bee Health (GIHH) is an international collaboration of researchers, beekeepers, farmers, and industry set up to research the threats to bee health in order to better understand colony collapse and find solutions that will allow for sustainable crop pollination and food security. Integral to the research effort is RFID tags that are manually fitted to bees. The abundance of data being collected by the thousands of bee-attached sensors as well as additional environmental sensors poses several challenges regarding the interpretation and comprehension of the data, both computationally as well as from a user perspective. In this talk, I will discuss visual analytics techniques that we have been investigating to facilitate an effective path from data to insight. I will particularly focus on interactive and immersive user interfaces that allow for a range of end users to effectively explore the complex sensor data.\n\nHuyen is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the EPICentre, UNSW Art & Design in Sydney, NSW, Australia. My academic background focuses on Mixed Reality, Human-Computer Interaction, and Human Factors in Collaborative Mixed Reality. She was an OCE postdoctoral fellow at Data61, CSIRO in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, working on the Global Initiative for Honey bee Health (GIHH) and focusing on Data Visualisation and Immersive Analytics in Collaborative Frameworks. She received her M.Sc. degree in Intelligent Systems and Multimedia from University of La Rochelle, France in 2011 and my Ph.D. degree in Virtual Reality and 3D User Interaction from INSA Rennes, France in 2014.\n\nFor more on YOW!
