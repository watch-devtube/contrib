description: "Using agile methodologies like Scrum or XP has become common place in a lot of organizations, but what do you do when you want to scale your business or department in size. Just being Agile in it self won't stop growth of your business and teams descending into chaos. In this talk we will look at different techniques and team dynamics changes you can make to allow you to scale Agile across your business.\n\nIn this talk we will take a look at the Spotify model that has been gaining in popularity recently and discuss how this works for consumer facing products and how you can adapt it to work in more regulated business to business enterprises. I will give examples of where I have started to apply this model to a start-up working with regulated insurance companies, that is currently going through a hyper growth stage."
