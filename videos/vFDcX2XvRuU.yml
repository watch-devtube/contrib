recordingDate: 1431330768
description: 'Over the past few years a few JVM languages have gained adoption. Suppose on your next project, you’re asked to use an alternate language. Which one would you pick? In this presentations, we’ll put our personal biases away, look far beyond the syntax, and into the capabilities, the strengths and weaknesses of select prominent JVM languages. We will objectively compare them and create a configurable metric that will help us select the right language for that next project.'
