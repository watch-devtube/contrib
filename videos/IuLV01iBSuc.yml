description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nOctober 9, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Gregory Benford.\r\n\r\nGenescient is the world's first computational biology company founded on the use of artificial biological selection to cure the diseases of aging. Our laboratory animals have been selected for longevity through 750 generations  for the equivalent of 15,000 human years. I will describe Genescient's multiple pathways toward accelerating human longevity, with parallel enhancements of vigor and function. Genescient applies 21st century genomic technology to identify, screen and develop benign therapeutic substances at precise doses, to defeat the diseases of aging. Our singular approach addresses the complex genomic networks that underlie aging and aging-associated diseases such as cardiovascular disease, Type II diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. I shall display some results and our first product, due in 2009. \r\n\r\nGregory Benford is a Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Irvine, where he was a Professor of Physics.  He is a Woodrow Wilson Fellow, a Fellow of the American Physical Society and was Visiting Fellow at Cambridge University and the Universities of Turin and Bologna. In 1995 he received the Lord Prize for contributions to science. With more than 200 scientific publications, his research encompasses both theory and experiments in the fields of astrophysics and plasma physics. His research has been supported by NSF, NASA, AFOSR, DOE and other agencies. He is an ongoing advisor to NASA, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and the CIA.\r\n\r\nDr. Benford is also the author of more than thirty books, nearly all still in print. His work has won many awards, including the Nebula Award for his novel Timescape. His non-fiction Deep Time received much praise in 1999 and he won the United Nations Medal in literature in 1994.\r\n\r\nGregory Benford became Emeritus form the University of California, Irvine, in 2006 in order to found and develop Genescient."
