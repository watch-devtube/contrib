description: "Sunil Mallya, AWS\n\nAbstract: \nServerless computing reduces infrastructure complexity, provides fine grained billing and easy scalability. Setting up concurrent data processing infrastructure pipelines that supports many users is a complex task, moreover utilization, cost and performance are hard to tune for these pipelines. Machine Learning (ML) workloads are on the uptick, and likes of Apache Spark aim to provide an end to end data to ML story, but run in to the same complexities previously mentioned. These aren't two disjoint data and ML workflows, but share a lot in common.\n\nIn this talk, I will present a serverless data and machine learning pipeline that includes a MapReduce framework built on using Amazon S3 and AWS Lambda. We'll see how it can help alleviate issues like concurrent processing, cost and scaling. I will also showcase how machine learning algorithms like K-Means clustering can be built on top of this framework, exploiting the inherent distributed architecture. We'll then discuss the benefits and challenges of the framework with a focus on production deployments for ML models.\n\nView the full LISA18 Program at https://www.usenix.org/lisa18/conference-program"
