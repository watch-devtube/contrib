description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nDecember 15, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nReliable two-way communications are a central component of the effort to modernize the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Wireless mesh networks are particularly suited to the task, offering a robust, self-healing architecture that is independent of the grid's own conductors, capacity that can carry not only meter and sensor data but also support video monitoring of critical infrastructure and broadband communications for line crews, and versatility to support many other applications, including public safety, intelligent transportation systems, and public access. Utilities are increasingly deploying Wi-Fi mesh networks as communications backbones, and in some cases as complete solutions for connectivity all the way down to the meter. This talk will discuss the state of the art in wireless mesh technology, including innovations that came about through building and operating the GoogleWiFi network in Mountain View in collaboration with Google.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Cyrus Behroozi\r\nCyrus Behroozi is Chief Scientist at Tropos Networks. He joined the company in 2000 and developed its first wireless mesh networking hardware. He currently researches network performance in large-scale city-wide Wi-Fi mesh networks, exploring techniques to improve reliabilty, enhance coverage, and increase capacity. Toward these goals, he has developed advanced distributed algorithms for route selection, power and bit rate control, airtime coordination, and channel selection. He is also exploring other licensed and unlicensed wireless technologies that can benefit from a femtocellular mesh architecture and Tropos' innovations in radio resource management.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining Tropos, Mr. Behroozi was in the graduate program in Applied Physics at Harvard University. He was part of the research team that slowed light to 38 miles per hour in a Bose-Einstein condensate and subsequently stopped it outright. He co-authored two articles in Nature on this work.\r\n\r\nMr. Behroozi holds a B.S. in Physics from the California Institute of Technology and an A.M. in Applied Physics from Harvard University."
