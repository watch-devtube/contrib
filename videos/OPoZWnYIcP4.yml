description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nBattle.net is the online service that runs Blizzard's games. As such, it is a large scale distributed system with many interacting parts and dependencies on various services and data. While developing Battle.net servers, I needed a way to isolate and test functionality that I was working on.\n\nIn this talk I will cover my experience designing for testability of components in a distributed system, and practical ways to structure classes and data to facilitate testing. I will also present my solution to the problem of testing my code for correctness, performance and scalability without having to deploy a full-scale environment and spin up a million clients.\n— \nBen has been writing games for almost 20 years, and in C++ for most of that. He is currently a Principal Engineer at Blizzard Entertainment where he works on the Battle.net team. He's always looking for useful new techniques in C++, and he likes functional programming.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
