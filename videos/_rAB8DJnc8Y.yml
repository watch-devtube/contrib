title: 'DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Workflow Initiative (Drupal is a CMS)'
recordingDate: 1463076384
description: "The session formally known as \"Drupal is a CMS, so how can we better manage content?\"\n\nYay, we have UUIDs in core, but given a UUID you can't find what it identifies without looping through every entity.\nYay, we have revisions in core, but we have to specifically turn them on, they are only on two core entity types, and we don't have a revision tree, so we can't see where a revision stemed from.\nYay, we can delete entities, actually, that's not a \"yay\", once they are gone they're gone, no way to retieve them, no way to archive them.\netc.\netc.\nThese are just some of the things that are trying to be solved in contrib to make a platform where we can better manage content. Also it's not only the storage level stuff we have been looking at, it's staging content and reviewing content. Many people use a dev-stage-production workflow with code, and now with configuration, why can't we do this with content? We can! So now's the time to slowly but surely add these into core.\n\nThis session will look at some of the quick wins, and how we go about getting them into core. we will then briefly look at further goals, and a road map to get there. It will step through all related issues in the queue and what we need to do in the sprints to get these patches written and committed.\n\nEach of the points raised in the session will have a d.o issue attached to it so as a collective group we can focus the efforts from the session into actual deliverables.\n\nAbout the presenter\n\nTim Millwood (aka timmillwood) has been working with Drupal since 2008, he is the core maintainer of the statistics module, and contributor to many contrib modules. After working at Mark Boulton Design, and Acquia, Tim is now a Senior Developer for Appnovation working on Composer based builds and content staging solutions."
