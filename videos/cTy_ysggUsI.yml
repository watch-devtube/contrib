description: "Project Avatar enables developers to create hybrid Java/JavaScript applications on the Java Virtual Machine, enabled by the high-performance Nashorn JavaScript engine, available in Java 8. In this session, learn how single-threaded Node applications can benefit from a multithreaded JVM, seamlessly interoperate with existing Java libraries, and utilize feature-rich Java EE services such as JPA with JavaScript APIs.
