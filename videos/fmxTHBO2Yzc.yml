description: "RubyConf 2018 - Cheating with Ruby by Cameron Dutro\n\nI used Ruby to cheat at a computer game, and it was so much fun. Come to this talk to hear about a game solver that analyzes a screenshot of the game and calculates the correct answer. We'll chat about dynamic image analysis, perceptual hashes, and the traveling salesman problem. I promise, it's going to be great."
