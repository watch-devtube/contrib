title: '"Life Amongst the Authentica-ceans " - William Brown (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612091785
description: "William Brown\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/37/\n\nAuthentication and IDM technologies are at the core of our system and network security. Whether it's logging into our personal laptop, or a corporate website, authentication is how we define roles and privileges to our users and ourselves. Opensource has a number of IDM offerings, as do corporate offerings. In this talk, we'll explore some of the history of these projects and what they offer, the direction that authentication and security is moving in. We'll also introduce Kanidm, a new opensource IDM system that has been created to adapt to these changes in IDM and security, and talk about what it's achieved in a short space of time, and what the future holds for it.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nSun Jan 24 13:30:00 2021 at Pia Andrews Conservatory"
