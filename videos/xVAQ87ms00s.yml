description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMogens Heller Grabe - NServiceBus core team member at Particular Software and Technology Evangelist at d60\n\nABSTRACT\nMany software development teams have already realized that big systems equal big price and big risk, whereas small systems equal small price and small risk, so it is becoming increasingly apparent that we're better off building several smaller systems instead of a huge monolith. This means that your architecture will be sliced many times vertically, and each slice will probably not need as many layers as you may be used to.\n\nThis makes building each slice an easier and more lightweight task, but it demands that you have the right tools to \"integrate the slices\". In this session, we'll take a look at Rebus, which can be the glue that binds the pieces together. We'll take a look at three typical problems in enterprise software development, tie those problems to a real world setting, and then we'll see how Rebus with its reliable asynchronous messaging capabilities can help alleviate each problem.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
