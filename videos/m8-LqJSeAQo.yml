description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nVirtual Machines as First Class Citizens in Service Mesh - Denis Jannot, Solo.io\n\nThe adoption of containerization is accelerating and running modern applications on Kubernetes became the standard. But what about the legacy applications that can't be deployed on Kubernetes ? Service Mesh seems to be the bridge that everyone wanted to unify these 2 worlds. You can now (somewhat) easily add Virtual Machines (and even Bare Metal servers) into your Mesh. In this talk, I'm going to show how to do that on Istio and speak about the different challenges someone needs to keep in mind: - how to automate the process (from the creation of Service Accounts on Kubernetes to the deployment of the prerequisites in the VMs). - how to add VMs in the Mesh in a multi cluster deployment. - how to allow canary deployments between Pods and VMs I'll also do a demo where I'll show how to automate the testing using Kind and Docker containers (yes, testing the VM integration without a VM !"
