description: "Electron is a cross-platform open source platform for building desktop applications using web technologies and NodeJS, used in tools like Visual Studio Code, Atom, Slack, Nylas N1 and Brave.\nIn this talk I'll walk through the internals of Electron, explain how it all comes together at runtime, and show how it integrates with the operating system underneath.\n\nWhether you're brand new to Electron, getting started or you already have a large-scale application using Electron, there's plenty to learn under the hood."
