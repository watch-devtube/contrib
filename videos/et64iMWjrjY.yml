description: "The Smart City - Where mammals and computers live together in mutually programming harmony like pure water touching clear sky\n\nSpeaker: Herr Flupke (🐰)\n\nTalk of 20 minutes\n\nAs the internet trickles through society it starts to transform the very places where people live. Some think it can change cities in this century as much as electricity did in the last one. The governments of the world, the weary giants of flesh and steel, also tap into this new home. This talk will step away from the computer screen to look at the design patterns of current toolchains for the so-called \"smart city\" and their implications. Is there a way the free/libre open (source software) spirit can be baked into the infrastructure that society runs on?\n\nAbout Herr Flupke:\n\nherr flupke explains machines to humans and humans to machines. His work involves security and privacy, community and ethics.\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.fossasia.org/schedule/#ISC-01\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCcE/"
