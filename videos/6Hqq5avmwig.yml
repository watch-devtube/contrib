description: "CredHub and Secure Credential Management - Peter Blum & Scott Frederick, Pivotal\n\n From the platform all the way down to the microservices which run upon it, secrets are everywhere and leaking them can be a costly experience. Understanding security best practices, such as encrypting secrets while in transit; encrypting secrets at rest; rotating secrets regularly; preventing secrets from unintentionally leaking when consumed by the final application; and strictly adhering to the principle of least-privilege, where an application only has access to the secrets that it needs—no more, no less.....can be daunting. A new Cloud Foundry Foundation project, CredHub, was designed for these reasons. This session will take a fresh look at how to enhance security within Cloud Foundry and applications through secret management by utilizing CredHub in conjunction with Spring Cloud Services. \n\nAbout Peter Blum\nPeter is a Platform Architect with Pivotal and has worked with several customers to help deploy and run Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Prior he contributed to Diego Persistence components in Cloud Foundry, as well as the RackHD CPI for BOSH.\n\nAbout Scott Frederick\nScott Frederick is a Sr. Software Engineer at Pivotal, working on Spring Framework and Cloud Foundry open-source and commercial projects.\n\nScott has been using CloudFoundry, Java, Groovy, and Spring since the early days of each of these technologies, to solve real-world problems. Before joining Pivotal, Scott spent many years in the travel and transportation industry."
