description: "Remember the times when you needed to hardcode an API response because the actual APIs are still to be implemented? Making it impossible to simulate edge cases with the real APIs or the network? The wait is over! Khang has created just the tool for those situations.\n\nKhang works as React Native developer at Employment Hero by day. He is a JavaScript hacker & open source contributor by night. He organizes the React Native facebook community group for Vietnam.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 25+26 November 2016.\n\nSource: https://2016.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
