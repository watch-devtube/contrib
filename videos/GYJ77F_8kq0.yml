description: "Picasso's The Bull is a series of eleven prints showing his process of abstraction, step by step. Starting with a realistic image, he progressively deconstructs and compresses the bull into an abstract geometric form. Artists, mathematicians, and software developers alike have been captivated by Picasso's creative process.\n\nHow could we teach a computer to imitate this style? With neural style transfer? That method transfers color and texture, but preserves geometry, so it works better with Van Gogh's Starry Night than Picasso's Bulls. Picasso explained, \"A picture used to be a sum of additions. In my case a picture is a sum of destructions.\"\n\nWe can approximate Picasso's \"destructions\" with a series of geometric transformations and image processing functions. We'll explore these techniques with Python code, using libraries like OpenCV, for open source computer vision.\n\nWe'll learn about the underlying mathematics, not through formulas in research papers and textbooks, but with code and visuals, in Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter enables us to experiment with interactive, animated output, and show our work step by step like Picasso.\n\nWe'll apply our transformations to generate new art inspired by Picasso's Bulls. The results will be far from perfect, but the mistakes are interesting!\n\nSpeaker: Ryan Herr"
