description: "Continuous Monitoring in DevOps for Large Health Care\n\nProfessor Phil Lerner, Distinguished Engineer, UHG/Optum\n\nSecurity has become a stakeholder in the new DevOps as a rugged partner to the teams. As we evaluate new tools, their interconnectivity, isolation, sandbox and enablement for the DevOps community we have developed a conceptual security architecture that would allow DevOps to move at the rapid delivery pace they are used to while security will become a transparent set of controls and part of the fabric or control plane of the tools suites we choose to enable to transform the DevOps experience. This presentation will cover those advanced technical topics with a strong focus on cyber security in DevOps.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
