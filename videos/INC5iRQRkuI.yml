title: 'GraalVM: Run Programs Faster Anywhere by Oleg Slajev'
recordingDate: 1550058157
description: "GraalVM project enhances the Java ecosystem with an integrated, polyglot, high-performance execution environment for Java, Scala, Kotlin, Groovy, and other JVM-based languages and also JavaScript, Ruby, R, and Python, and C/C++ too.\n\nIn this session you'll learn what you can do with GraalVM, from using it as the JVM JIT compiler, enhancing the JIT, running native and polyglot programs, compiling them ahead of time for faster startup, debugging your polyglot code using exact same tools for any language, to profiling performance and memory of your application and embedding GraalVM in a native application for portability.\n\nGraalVM offers you the opportunity to write the code in the language you want, which suits the problem the best, and run the resulting program really fast."
