description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nMay 12, 2010\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Hano Sander \r\n\r\nHano Sander built a simple programming language that's used by kids to explore robotics. His talk will focus on using the block based paradigm to write programs for TBot - a wireless, speech enabled robot that communicates to form swarms- and fits in a child's hand. He will show plenty of demos and explore how robots can be used in the classroom. \r\n\r\nHanno Sander caught the entrepreur bug after graduating from Stanford. He's now developing sophisticated robots and software in New Zealand. He has co-authored the official guide for the Parallax Propeller and co-founded the OneRobot.org foundation, a non-profit bringing robots to classrooms.\r\n\r\nAlso see the Hanno's Google Tech Talk on Dancebots here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmpPm2Di0Bo"
