description: "Deep Dive: VMware SIG – Michael Gasch & Steven Wong, VMware \n\nKubernetes allows using topology labels to affect the scheduler’s placement of pods. This is used to spread pods across availability zones, while still respecting resource access and availability concerns. When Kubernetes runs on vSphere, the hypervisor platform also supports an underlying tier of high availability and automated placement options, for both control plane and worker nodes. 2 levels of scheduling and resource management are active. Currently no automatic scheduling integration occurs, that is, Kubernetes is not aware of the underlying vSphere topology (sites, affinity groups, NUMA, etc.). This session will explain the options to gain better performance, resource optimization and availability through tuning of vSphere, and Kubernetes configuration and labeling. This is applicable to any K8s distribution running on the vSphere stack. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Grd6"
