description: "Strata Online Conference: Data That Matters\n\nIt was the best of times: open, unfettered access to data from around the world in an instant, and the tools to analyze it and put it in the hands of the many. Today's always-on society has access to the sum of all human thoughts in a click or a tap. Data can right wrongs, speak for the mute, and shine a light on corruption.\n\nIt was the worst of times: laziness, a slippery slope of legislative red tape, and closed, proprietary systems undermine our rights and invade our lives, turning Big Data into Big Brother.\n\nJoin us for our seventh Strata online conference, as we look at Data That Matters. We'll explore the ways that open access to information is changing how we live, love, work, and play. Hear from innovators, activists and defenders of the commons, and look at what we can do to improve humanity by putting petabytes of raw content to work on the problems society faces.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
