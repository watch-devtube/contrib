description: "A talk from Barcelona Ruby Conference 2013 (http://baruco.org)\n\nOver the past six years, JRuby has gone from a wobbly 1.0 release to being the alternative implementation of choice for high performance, horizontal scaling, big data, and wide ranging deployment. We've steadily improved JRuby's runtime while catching up with MRI 1.9 and 2.0 features. Now we're looking toward the future with an upcoming rework of JRuby. What will it bring? How will we boost performance? What will we add to the Ruby platform to make concurrency commonplace and painless? This talk will summarize our plans for JRuby 9000 and open a dialog on what Ruby needs to survive long term.\n\nhttp://www.baruco.org/talks/the-future-of-jruby\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)"
