recordingDate: 1514413472
description: "Monero is a cryptocurrency that enables private transactions. That means the sender, receiver, and transaction amount are not publicly viewable, unlike Bitcoin's blockchain. Monero's transactions stay private using the technology of ring signatures, ringCT, stealth addresses, and I2P routing. I'll explain how all of this works in this video. I do not condone the use of this technology for illegal transactions. This is powerful stuff, ideally, we start using this as a stepping stone towards a world where we get paid for our transactional data (and all the rest of our data). \n\nYou'll find the jupyter notebook for this video and the associated code that I demo in the github link below.  \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/how_does_monero_work\n\nMore learning resources:\nhttps://getmonero.org/\nhttps://github.com/monero-project/monero\nhttps://www.monero.how/tutorial-how-to-use-the-monero-gui-wallet\nhttps://www.monero.how/tutorial-how-to-mine-monero\nhttps://99bitcoins.com/beginners-guide-to-monero/\n\nPlease Subscribe!
