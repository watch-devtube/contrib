description: "USENIX Security '21 - Fuzzy Labeled Private Set Intersection with Applications to Private Real-Time Biometric Search\n\nErkam Uzun, Simon P. Chung, Vladimir Kolesnikov, Alexandra Boldyreva, and Wenke Lee, Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nThe explosive growth of biometrics use (e.g., in surveillance) poses a persistent challenge to keep biometric data private without sacrificing the apps' functionality. We consider private querying of a real-life biometric scan (e.g., a person's face) against a private biometric database. The querier learns only the label(s) of a matching scan(s) (e.g. a person's name), and the database server learns nothing. We formally define Fuzzy Labeled Private Set Intersection (FLPSI), a primitive computing the intersection of noisy input sets by considering closeness/similarity instead of equality. Our FLPSI protocol's communication is sublinear in database size and is concretely efficient. We implement it and apply it to facial search by integrating with our fine-tuned toolchain that maps face images into Hamming space. We have implemented and extensively tested our system, achieving high performance with concretely small network usage: for a 10K-row database, the query response time over WAN (resp. fast LAN) is 146ms (resp. 47ms), transferring 12.1MB; offline precomputation (with no communication) time is 0.94s. FLPSI scales well: for a 1M-row database, online time is 1.66s (WAN) and 1.46s (fast LAN) with 40.8MB of data transfer in online phase and 37.5s in offline precomputation. This improves the state-of-the-art work (SANNS) by 9-25× (on WAN) and 1.2-4× (on fast LAN). Our false non-matching rate is 0.75% for at most 10 false matches over 1M-row DB, which is comparable to underlying plaintext matching algorithm.\n\nView the full USENIX Security '21 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/technical-sessions"
