title: 'Express yourself with Groovy DSLs'
recordingDate: 1501170341
description: 'A DSL is a Domain Specific Language. We will learn how to use Groovy''s static and dynamic capabilities to create a usable DSL. Groovy supports for example Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) transformations which allows us to alter the code structure before it is even generated. We will see how to use with annotations and global transformations. Next we will see how we can integrate Groovy dynamically in Java. We will create a DSL and allow a Java application to execute the code, where the source code is externalized outside the Java application. For example business users could alter the code using the DSL and the running Java application will run the altered code.'
