description: "The history why we wrote our own replication tool between Oracle and PostgreSQL with a bit of low level archivelog architecture explanation.\n\nWe should buy a bar!\nOf course, we should buy a bar!!! Brilliant why we didn’t think about it earlier!?\nDo you have a few hundred thousand euros?\nA pint then?\nA pint then. We all want to have a bar and drive a Porsche... But in most of the cases, we can afford only a few pints and drive with a VW. Replication engines are expensive and buying something like Golden Gate when you only have SE database and you want to replicate it to PostgreSQL is like buying a single malt to make Cola taste more bearable. That’s why we wrote our own replicator tool. A simple one. A cheap one. Nothing fancy. But it works. And we will use this subject as an excuse to show some low-level archivelog tricks.\nIt will be a live demo, showing how to resolve replication problems in heterogeneous database environment without spending lots of money:)"
