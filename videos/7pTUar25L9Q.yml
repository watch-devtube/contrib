title: 'Removing engineering friction: Creating an evolutionary culture - Phillip Liu (SignalFx)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1502730721
description: "Phillip Liu explores the one thing that has become a driver of ever better engineering: constant removal of friction for engineers to not only build and ship code but also understand how code is used and how it works and operates. The end result is a culture that promotes many possible ways to address given challenges and surfaces novel approaches, which may have never arisen otherwise.\n\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
