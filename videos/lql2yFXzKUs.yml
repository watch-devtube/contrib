title: 'USE lisp WITH game - Making an Adventure Game with Clojure - Bryce Covert'
recordingDate: 1460853987
description: 'Old-school adventure games were infamous for their mind-bending logic. While you might pull quite a bit of hair playing one, writing one can be a lot more fun, especially when written in Clojure. We will embark on a quest, examining how some of Clojure''s features, libraries, and functional paradigms can bring some sanity and simplicity into the otherwise complex world of game development. We''ll look at how to model SCUMM-style dialogue trees, write in-game cutscene scripts, and build a game while it''s running using an nREPL server.'
