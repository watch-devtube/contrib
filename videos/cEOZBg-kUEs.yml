title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Teaching Clients How to Succeed'
recordingDate: 1506592893
description: "One of the first things I learned when taking over sales at Palantir.net was the importance of setting client expectations early in the sales process. For many clients, web projects happen once a decade. It becomes imperative that we make sure that clients understand the components that make for long-term project success.\n\nIn this session, we will look at the building blocks of successful projects, how to describe them to clients, and how to set expectations around schedules and budgets. We will take deep dives into the following project areas:\n\nBusiness strategy\nContent strategy\nDesign\nDevelopment\nTesting\nDeployment\nTraining\nSupport\nThis session is designed for sales teams and business leaders. Attendees should leave with actionable ideas for how to:\n\nTell a story about how their services drive client success\nHelp clients understand how to plan for a web project\nSet client expectations around budgets and schedules\nPrepare training materials for sales teams to use when talking about Drupal projects."
