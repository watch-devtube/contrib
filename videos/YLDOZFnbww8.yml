description: "The story of a mathematical idea that changed the world \n\nAlan Turing's paper from 1936, where he describes what came to be known as the Turing machine, is one of the truly pivotal papers in the history of computer science. Turing's description of what he called the \"universal machine\" is frequently referred to as the starting point of the technological revolution we today call the computer. He wrote his paper during a time when the world was going through a dramatic set of upheavals both scientifically, technologically and politically, and his work is a prime example of how basic research of a seemingly esoteric problem can have far reaching consequences. \n\nAre you interested in learning more about Turing's ground breaking accomplishment? Then join me and hear the fascinating story of the Turing machine! I will describe both its historical context and its implications, but first and foremost I will explain the details of Turing's fictional machine and what he was trying to accomplish with it. This is the story of how a mathematician thought outside the box and accidentally changed the course of history! \n\nØystein Kolsrud is a developer at Qlik in Lund, and has been giving public presentations on software engineering related topics. Functional programming is close to his heart, but with this presentation he gets to leverage his passion for history and science to tell the fascinating story surrounding a remarkable part of the history of computers. \n__________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
