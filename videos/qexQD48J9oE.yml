recordingDate: 1506434188
description: "PHP 7 comes with massive performance improvements, and with PHP 7.2 around the corner, it is time we update our code to be compatible with the modern, faster, and secure PHP 7.\n\nThis session will walk through the major changes and improvements in PHP 7, 7.1, and the currently finalized 7.2. This is not targeted for Drupal specifically, but there will be information on Drupal-specific changes as well, one of them being requiring a minimum PHP version project-wise and module-wise, with regular .info file and composer formats.\n\nGenerators for efficient data storage and retrieval\nScalar type hints for statically analyzable code\nStrict typing\nModern curl and TLS features (ECC keys, HTTP/2, etc)\nNull coalesce, spaceship operators\nAnonymous classes\nBetter error handling with catchable parse errors, type errors, and new Throwable exception type\nUserland CSPRNG\nLibsodium in core\nExpectations/assert\nRemoved and deprecated features\n... and more\nPHP 7 is a major step forward from 5.6, and the frequent releases of 7.1, and the new 7.2 which is currently in beta comes with a lot polishing for the language too.\n\nThis session is for everyone, including the beginners that we try to focus on how to make use of these new features, and why they are important & useful. PHP 7 has been around for a some time now, and some of the most used open source projects, such as PHPUnit now require PHP 7.0, while components of doctrine project require PHP 7.1.\n\nThat said, even though this session is a 25-minute session, we will try to squeeze as much as possible, with a few minutes for Q&A, and being open to ask questions during the session, we will try to open new possibilities, clean up the code, modernize, secure, and speed up your existing and new PHP projects."
