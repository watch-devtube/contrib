title: 'Tugdual Grall - Anomaly Detection in Telecom with Spark'
recordingDate: 1472121818
description: 'Telecom operators need to find operational anomalies in their networks very quickly. This need, however, is shared with many other industries as well so there are lessons for all of us here. Spark plus a streaming architecture can solve these problems very nicely. I will present both a practical architecture as well as design patterns and some detailed algorithms for detecting anomalies in event streams. These algorithms are simple but quite general and can be applied across a wide variety of situations.'
