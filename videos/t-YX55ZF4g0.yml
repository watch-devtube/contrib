description: "Logging is more complicated than most people realize, and when they do, it's too late to do anything about it until \"next time.\" Learn how to use a writer monad as a logging mechanism in your code. More importantly though, learn why you would want to do this, and what the benefits are.\n\nThere is a price to pay in adopting this approach, but it's more \"functional\", addresses existing challenges, and enables new, exciting capabilities.\n\nMartin Snyder\nMarch 4th, 2016\n\nProduced by NewCircle - Training & Resources for Developers:\nhttps://newcircle.com/"
