description: 'Whether your code is being reviewed by colleagues or an open source project maintainer, a smooth code review contributes to a slick development process. Every developer should be able to read code as well as write it, and becoming expert at code review is a great way for developers of all levels to improve both their coding skills and their patch acceptance rates! This session looks at how the code review process works and gives concrete advice on preparing a pull request, reviewing a change, and communicating feedback. Recommended for anyone who collaborates on a project with other people.'
