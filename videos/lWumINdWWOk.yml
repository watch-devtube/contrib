recordingDate: 1507518001
description: "The ability to get the latest greatest version of your product into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way, a.k.a Continuous Delivery is the need of the hour for every enterprise out there. Over the years, we've got very good about Continuous Delivery for server-side, web-applications. However, it's not as streamlined for Mobile or Desktop Apps.\n\nThis talk will cover the typical aspects we need to address while setting up a Continuous Delivery culture in the context of a large-scale mobile app:\n* SCM/Version Control: moving from Feature Branches to a trunk-based development model\n* Build/Test Environments: Decentralising the build & test environments using Containers(Docker) and CI Server(Jenkins)\n* Microservices Architecture: Segregating and containerize the micro-services. Also refactoring the mobile apps to be more container friendly.\n* Device Farm: Setting up a mobile device farm (using STF or ADF)\nCode-reviews: Improving the quality of code-reviews (using SonarQube, PRBuilder & PRRiskAdvisor)\n* Test Pyramid: Building the right Test Pyramid to get rapid feedback by creating different kinds of automated tests to align with the CI Pipeline\n* Code Quality: Visualising the health of our code-base (using C3)\n\nGeek...Consultant...Conference Producer...Startup Founder…struggling to stay up-to-date with technology innovation.
