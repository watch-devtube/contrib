Clustering data into subsets is an important task for many data science applications. It is considered as one of the most important unsupervised learning technique. \nThis video includes the following topics:\n\n1. What is Clustering?\n2. Why Clustering?\n3. Clustering Algorithm classification\n4. Similarity/Dissimilarity Measurement\n5. Difference between Euclidean and Manhattan\n6. Cosine Distance Measure\n7. K-Means Clustering\n8. Process Flow of K-Means\n9. Step-by-Step Pictorial Representation of K-Means Clustering\n10. K-Means Mathematical Formula\n11. K-Means Clustering Use Cases\n\nRelated Posts: \nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/application-of-clustering-in-data-science-using-real-life-examples/\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would prefer a hassle free and self paced learning environment, accessible from any part of the world.\nThe topics related to Storm are extensively covered in our 'Data Science' course. \nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co \nCall us at US : 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India : +91-8880862004"
