description: "Mercedes Wyss, CTO, Produactivity\n\nA MORE SECURE WORLD FOR ANDROID APPS\nBest Practices / Code Quality / Talk / Beginner\n\nIn the world of development, security is sometimes a subject that does not receive the importance it should have. This talk has as objective touch some points for make Android Apps more secure. \n\nWe will start the talk by studying some real-life cases where there was an absolute lack of security or poorly implemented strategies, in situations like consume web services, SSL/TLS certificates; how use JSON Web Tokens next to JSON Web Signature and JSON Web Encryption, not only for Authentication and Authorization processes, if not for Information Exchange too. Then we will evaluate use some libraries as the SafetyNet APIs like reCAPTCHA; or PaaS technologies for implement User Management, Passwordless and Multifactor Authentication using Firebase or Auth0 Technologies."
