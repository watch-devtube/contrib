description: "A Vision For API Machinery: Coming to Terms with the Platform We Built - Daniel Smith, Google \n\nKubernetes is what it is in large part due to the API Machinery it is constructed from and co-evolved with. At this point in the project’s life, we have a much richer understanding of the users API Machinery serves--and their needs. And so we propose a path forward, describing how API Machinery can better serve these and future users, and how the Kubernetes runtime, libraries, tools, and repositories can be refactored in service of this goal. API Machinery is a force multiplier for Kubernetes, but often disguised as a tax; it’s time to rectify this together. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrTu"
