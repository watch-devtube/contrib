description: "Jan Groth\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/203/\n\nPython is a great language for DevOps tasks. It’s easy to use for automation and offers an end-to-end range of tooling for managing infrastructure on-premise and in the cloud. Scripts are quickly implemented and new features easily rolled out. But what if complexity grows and all of the sudden you find yourself in a complete mess? How do you add a new feature or fix a bug in a script that you struggle to understand because it was written months ago? And do you sometimes see someone else’s code that you like but can't always put your finger on the magic ingredient? This talk is aimed at you if you are reasonably confident reading Python code and want to discover and improve beyond the basics. I'll provide you with ideas and suggestions that will help you stay on top of your coding and will bring it to the next level: Clean code which is easier to understand, more functional, testable and beautiful.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
