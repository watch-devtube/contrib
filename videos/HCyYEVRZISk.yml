description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Josh Long, Phil Webb\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/bootiful\nCore Spring Track\nAlright, so maybe \"bootiful\" won't ever work, but we tried, and it was worth it too because you're reading this. Spring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly, but pleasant! Join Spring developer advocate Josh Long and Spring Boot co-lead Phillip Webb for a look at what Spring Boot is, why it's turning heads, why you should consider it for your next application (REST, web, batch, big-data, integration, whatever!) and how to get started."
