description: "Speaker: Davide Storti, ITO Misako (UNESCO)\n\nThe YouthMobile Initiative builds on the experience of many worldwide initiatives that introduce young people to computer science programming (learning-to-code) and problem solving (coding-to-learn). It also seeks to build on experiences targeting young women who are vastly underrepresented in this field. Finally it builds on the consideration that for millions of young people, the smartphone in their pocket is a very powerful computer, it will be their only computer, and they use it for nearly every aspect of their lives: communicating, learning, taking pictures, and playing games.\n\nAbout Davide Storti, ITO Misako:\n\nWHO BENEFITS FROM YOUTHMOBILE? »Youth and Youth organizations Informal learning opportunities for youth to engage in society and earn livelihoods as mobile app entrepreneurs. ICT-enabled youth organizations creating a sustainable pool of trainers, support staff, and mentors. »Secondary School Students Acquiring high-level 21st century skills and confidence to develop/promote mobile apps to resolve local issues of sustainable development. »Teachers and Principals Teaching a new, innovative course in mobile apps development, acquiring ICT-pedagogy skills, connecting the school to other schools nationally and globally. » By gathering training materials to teach young people to develop mobile apps. The materials will be high-level and open-licensed for translation, localization, and innovations. Training materials will be pedagogically accurate for accreditation and employer recognition. » By training teachers to teach the students. UNESCO will be identifying all schools worldwide with existing programs for advanced computer studies. » By linking the learners to mobile app competitions, through the creation of the first global list of app competitors: encouraging trained students to submit apps for prizes, recognition, and employment opportunities; and let them meet and learn from those who made it.\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.fossasia.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/IIfJ/"
