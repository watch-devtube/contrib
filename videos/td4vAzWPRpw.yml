description: 'Java 8 is being around for a while already and lot of us are already using Java 8 features on our projects. But do we use these great Java 8 features correctly and efficiently? Having done lots of code reviews during last years we’ve seen some common antipatterns of Java 8 features usage. In this talk we want to show you some of the examples where Java 8 features were misused or poorly used and show you how certain things could have been better implemented.'
