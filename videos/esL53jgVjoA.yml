description: "Conference talks are often focused on big and innovative ideas that in many cases kick start brand new approaches to our people and work, which is a great thing that continually helps push our industry forward.\n\nHowever, when managing projects or leading teams, being consistently good at getting the absolute basics right can be the difference between success and failure.\n\nIn this session, Sam will discuss some of these basics, how often they’re forgotten or overlooked, why they’re so important and how to get better at them in such a way that you really see positive changes in both what you’re helping to deliver and your working relationships with the people around you.\n\nAbout Sam Barnes\nSam is a Senior Development Manager at Marks and Spencer and also the co-founder of PathfinderDPM. Although a little short for a Stormtrooper, he can be found writing at thesambarnes.com, a blog dedicated to digital project and team management."
