description: "Starting from bacteria and moving up the food chain, we’ll look at the uncanny way simple rules can create complex results. Along the way we’ll try and conquer the universe. Expect spaceships, explosions, mass extinction and some Javascript.\n\nSimon has been building the web since way back, seeing it evolve from obscure novelty to mainstream dominance. Currently he is designing and building realtime cloud solutions for connected devices. Simon created the Straw library and is a regular presenter at SydJS. On the side, he’s still trying to work out how to do Wing Chun properly.\n\nJSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia. Amara Sanctuary, Singapore - 20 + 21 November 2014.\n\nSource: http://2014.jsconf.asia/#speakers\nProject link: https://github.com/simonswain/deepspace\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
