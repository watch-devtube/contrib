description: "It’s no simple matter to explain the performance of even a simple Java program, when instruction execution time is often overshadowed by other costs. Even when the network and I/O costs have been taken into account, two programs with similar computational complexity—their big-O characteristics—can differ in cache usage, with big resulting differences in performance. For Java programmers, this means that big-O analysis no longer gives enough guidance in choosing a collection implementation for performance-critical code. This talk explores the effect of memory layout and the performance of some simple programs via alternative collection implementations and frameworks as well as the open source ObjectLayout library.\n\n\nMaurice Naftalin is Developer, author, teacher.
