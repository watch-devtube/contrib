description: "Generative Adversarial Nets are such a rich topic for exploration, we're going to build one that was released just 2 months ago called the \"DiscoGAN\" that lets us transfer the style between 2 datasets. And I'll be building this using Tensorflow.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/GANS-for-style-transfer\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment. That's what keeps me going.\n\nMore learning resources:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05192\nhttps://github.com/SKTBrain/DiscoGAN\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/5zp0eu/r_170305192_learning_to_discover_crossdomain/\nhttps://medium.com/@ageitgey/abusing-generative-adversarial-networks-to-make-8-bit-pixel-art-e45d9b96cee7\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nAnd please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
