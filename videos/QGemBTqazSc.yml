description: "The beautiful thing about software engineering is that it gives you the warm and fuzzy illusion of total understanding: Icontrol this machine because I know how it operates. This is the result of layers upon layers of successful abstractions, which hide immense sophistication and complexity. As with any abstraction, though, these sometimes leak, and that's when a good grounding in what's under the hood pays off.\n\nThis first in what will hopefully be a series of talks covers the fundamentals of storage, providing an overview of the most common storage medium on modern platforms (namely hard drives). You'll come away knowing a little bit about a lot of different moving parts under the hood; after all, isn't understanding how the machine operates what this is all about?"
