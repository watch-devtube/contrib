title: 'Tabs, spaces and salaries: a data science detective story - Evelina Gabasova'
recordingDate: 1532330107
description: "In data science, sometimes you stumble across an intriguing property in the data. I will tell you a story of a mysterious correlation - from the StackOverflow developer survey it seems that developers who use spaces have higher salaries than those who use tabs. Correlation doesn't mean causation: using spaces won't suddenly increase your salary. \nBut what does it all mean? Follow me into a detective investigation that will show you how to approach complex data science problems. I will show you some of the perils of correlation, model fitting and biases - how they can be dangerous and how to avoid these traps. And you'll also find how profitable your indentation style really is."
