description: "The landscape of stream processing frameworks gets more and more complicated. Some time ago Apache Storm was the only boy/girl in town. After that Spark Streaming emerged, then Apache Flink – European answer to Storm & Spark. What’s more – just few days ago Apache Dataflow entered incubation stage – aiming at API unification and backed by Google. I’m not even mentioning Samza, Flume nor projects that failed to gain traction.\n\nIn the talk I’d like to clear things a bit to help listeners (and myself) decide – which of above fit particular needs and which ones are stable enough to be used without fear."
