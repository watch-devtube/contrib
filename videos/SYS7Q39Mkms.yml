description: "From the 2015 Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose, Poppy Crum's keynote address, \"Data-driven Sensory Intelligence – Optimizing Our Perceptual Capabilities\".\n\nOur experience of the sensory world does not need to be constrained by our physical limitations. When navigating the environment our senses interact to perceive a robust non-veridical experience. Understanding these interactions and being able to define them perceptually and algorithmically allows technological developments that can facilitate sensory enhancement and optimization. Examples include use of targeted neuroplasticity to modify our internal experiences, personalized technologies for sensory augmentation, and maximizing the efficiency of our sensory capacity.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop San Jose 2015: http://goo.gl/k9J3GB\nVisit the conference website to learn more: http://strataconf.com/big-data-conference-ca-2015/\nSubscribe to O’Reilly on YouTube! http://goo.gl/szEauh\n\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia\n\nAbout Poppy Crum (Dolby Laboratories | Stanford University):\nPoppy Crum leads the Science Group at Dolby Laboratories and is a Consulting Professor at Stanford University in the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics and the Program in Symbolic Systems. At Dolby, Poppy is directing the growth of internal science. She is responsible for integrating neuroscience and psychophysical knowledge into algorithm and technological development and technology strategy. At Stanford, Poppy’s work and course direction is focused on the impact and feedback potential of new technologies with gaming and immersive environments on neuroplasticity.\nPoppy also represents scientific interests among external standards bodies and scientific organizations. She is currently a fellow of the US Defense Science Research Council and a U.S. representative to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Prior to joining Dolby Laboratories Poppy was Research Faculty in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine where her research focused on the functional circuitry of the auditory cortex. Poppy is a Fellow of the Audio Engineering Society. She completed her: Post-Doctoral work at Johns Hopkins in Biomedical Engineering; PhD at UC Berkeley in Neuroscience/Psychology; M.A at McGill University in Experimental Psychology, and B.Mus at the University of Iowa in Violin Performance."
