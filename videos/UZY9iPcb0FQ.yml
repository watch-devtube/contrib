description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2018\nhttps://dddeurope.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nSimplicity versus Simplification\n\nWe often hear that DDD is hard. People are trying and failing, complaining over increased complexity, which gets out of control. This case study will present how discovered domain complexity increases customer satisfaction and accidental technical complexity helped refactoring towards deeper insight.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nAlexey is a software architect and developer with present focus on domain models, domain-driven design (DDD), SOA and microservices, coaching and mentoring. Alexey is also a contributor to MassTransit open-source messaging framework for .NET and the organiser of the DDD Norway meetup."
