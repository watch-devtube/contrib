description: "Persistent Storage is coming to Diego! IBM, Pivotal, and EMC have partnered to extend the Cloud Foundry runtime to include persistence storage. We discuss the approach we are taking, how distributed filesystems and block storage services fit well with our service broker abstraction. and how we plan to offer these services in the marketplace. An overview of the types of storage, their differences, and the effect they have on scheduling and the application lifecycle will be discussed. Example use cases for each type of storage will be covered. We will also discuss the pros and cons of running databases and other services directly on Cloud Foundry. \n\nNagapramod Mandagere\nResearch Group Leader, IBM\nNagapramod Mandagere received his PhD from University of Minnesota in Enterprise data management. He has been a researcher at IBM Almaden Research center since 2008 working on various systems technologies. He has coauthored several conference papers and has several patents in domain of systems management\n\nPaul Warren\nSoftware Engineer, EMC\n\nTed Young\nPivotal\nTed has built distributed computer systems in a variety of environments: computer animation pipelines for VFX, live event coordination, and elastic compute platforms. In 2015 he received a Pivotal Research Grant to explore approaches to running persistent workloads in a multi-tenant environment. He is a core contributor to Diego, and heads up the Diego Persistence Team (Persi)."
