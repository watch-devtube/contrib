description: "Google I/O 2009 - Do You Believe in the Users?\r\n\r\nBrian Fitzpatrick, Ben Collins-Sussman\r\n\r\nToo many programmers have forgotten about the lost art of customer service. All software has users, though most developers have forgotten how to respect them, trust them, or sell their software to them in an exciting (but honest!) manner. This talk will focus on anecdotes and strategies for keeping software design uncomplicated, making software fast, and putting usability above programming convenience. Well also focus on the importance of keeping a healthy illusion of simplicity, while allowing abstractions to deliberately leak for power-users.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
