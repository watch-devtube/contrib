recordingDate: 1433505478
description: "Java EE 7 is a very rich environment. This session takes you on a practical code-driven Bean Validation walk-through: how to use it in your applications and what not to do—all with an example-driven approach. The presentation gradually adds constraints and validations to an existing application and examines many features, both old and new, including constraint declaration, custom constraint, method validation, EL-based message interpolation, JAX-RS integration, and many more. It spends as much time as possible in the IDE. No previous knowledge of Bean Validation is required.\n\n\nAuthor:\nEmmanuel Bernard\nAfter graduating from Supelec (French \"Grande Ecole\"), Emmanuel has spent a few years in the retail industry where he started to be involved in the ORM space.
