title: 'Cloud Ready: Introduction to Distributed Java Lambdas'
language: English
recordingDate: 1502110706
description: "This session features an interactive introduction to the concept of distributed lambdas, which are defined in one Java application but are launched and executed by one or possibly more remotely deployed Java applications (i.e. in a cloud). Attendees investigate how regular Java lambda expressions can be distributed to process large datasets and respond to streams of events, with a focus on the challenges for developers and those providing support for distributed lambdas.\n\nSpeaker: Harvey Raja"
