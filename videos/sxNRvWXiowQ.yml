description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nSascha Bates - Automator of All Things\n\nABSTRACT\nHow hard do you pray when adding new infrastructure or deploying code? How often do you forget a step done by hand in dev and subsequently forgotten at each environment progression?\n\nHappily, the question is no longer \"Should I use configuration management,\"  but \"How am I going to implement a reliable system?\" Having solved the question of what tool you want to use, it's time to ensure the rest of your infrastructure is ready to support you. Configuration Management can't breathe in a vacuum any more than people. Successful configuration management is part of a vibrant ecosystem. Failing to account for people, process and tools will make you (and everyone around you) sad.  \n\nConfiguration Management is complex. Depending on your current state, you may need to introduce it into existing infrastructure which brings its own set of challenges. We'll discuss the challenges in deploying a robust Configuration Management solution including build, testing and deploymen\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
