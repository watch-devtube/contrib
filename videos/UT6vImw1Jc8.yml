description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nTesters don't just click around. Real testers don't do Ad hoc testing at all. They carefully plan their activities and help the whole team to build better and usable products, by being a part of the project team from the beginning, before the first line of code is even written. Testers write code, read code, dig into databases and logs and communicate to customers. They are the link between the code and customers."
