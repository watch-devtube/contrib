description: "by Jessica Rose\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.208/countless_beautiful_contributions.webm\n\n\nIf you're joining us in the Mozilla devroom, you're likely already passionate about some of the things Mozillans do to build a better internet, contribute to cutting edge technologies or to help teach and share knowledge. You may even have a favorite project in mind. In this talk we're going to look at a range of different volunteer and contribution opportunities across Mozilla projects that could use a little bit of TLC from you. We'll examine how volunteer efforts power these projects, what impact your contribution could make and talk about the impact volunteer efforts make across the web and the world. \n\nRoom: UD2.208 (Decroly)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 16:10:00+01"
