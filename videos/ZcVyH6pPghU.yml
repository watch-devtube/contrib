description: "Automatic memory management and garbage collection is one of the biggest advantages of JVM compared with previous platforms. But it has a price: GC overhead and pauses. When every millisecond counts this price can be too high. You can get away and not pay it by taking responsibility back into your hands.\n\nI will describe what does “off-heap” memory means for java application developer and how he can use it in order to speed his application up. The majority of this talk is live code demonstration. I will use different ways to implement off-heap data storage and will show how fast one and the same piece of code runs with each implementation."
