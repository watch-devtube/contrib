description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nArm yourself with Domain Driven Security. It's time to slay some security trolls?\n\nWe all know we have Anonymous, LulzSec, and NSA around. With this in mind, isn't it time to think about the security of our systems? Well, of course. In this talk, we'll show how Domain Driven Design is used to counteract security weaknesses without one thinking \"security\" all the time. So, if you're interested in learning how to design secure software, then this session is for you. \n\nBusiness and technical attacks are two kinds of attacks, where the latter is most famous, e g SQL Injection & XSS. But it doesn't mean business attacks are less harmful. On the contrary, they tend to be extremely sophisticated and powerful as they often leave infrastructure intact without firing alarms. Domain Driven Security is the field that counteracts both categories by using tools and mindsets from DDD.\n\nDaniel Deogun, Omegapoint \n\nCoder and Quality defender; fights security trolls on a daily basis using Domain Driven Design and a security mindset. Frequent speaker at international conferences. Daniel's extensive experience ranges from patient critical pacemaker systems to high performant software in the gaming industry. Combining this with his passion for DDD and his interest in security has made him a strong advocate of Domain Driven Security.\n\nDan Bergh Johnsson, Omegapoint\n\nAgile aficionado; Domain Driven Design enthusiast; code quality craftsman, with a long time interest in security. The combination made Dan use quality practices from DDD to address application security issues - thus coining \"Domain Driven Security\" together with John Wilander around 2009"
