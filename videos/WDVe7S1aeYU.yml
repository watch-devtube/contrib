description: "The shift to digital content changes many of the long-held rules of publishing and pricing models are no exception. There's continued downward pressure on prices, thanks in large part to the belief that $9.99 is all consumers are willing to pay for an ebook.\n\nLogos Bible Software is one of the pioneers in digital content and pricing. Their CEO, Bob Pritchett, will share the approach Logos uses to manage e-pricing across their list. Bob will also provide an overview of the community pricing model Logos now employs.\n\nSo although the rules are changing there are new opportunities that arise with digital content. Join us for what will undoubtedly be an insightful presentation by an industry leader and learn how the Logos experience can be applied to your own products.\n\nAbout Bob Pritchett\n\nIn 1992 Bob Pritchett co-founded Logos Research Systems, Inc. and serves as President/CEO. Bob speaks regularly at industry conferences and to academic groups on entrepreneurship, electronic publishing and digital libraries. He is a 2005 winner of the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year award, and was included in the Puget Sound Business Journal's 40 Under 40.\n\nAbout Joe Wikert\n\nJoe Wikert is General Manager & Publisher as well as Chair of Tools of Change (TOC) at O'Reilly Media, Inc., where he manages the sales and editorial groups. He's the author of the Publishing 2020 blog where he's provided industry insights since 2005.\n\nPrior to joining O'Reilly Joe was Vice President and Executive Publisher at John Wiley & Sons, Inc., in their P/T division.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
