description: "Not enough just to crunch numbers in Air Traffic Control, you have to be able to display those numbers. John Linfield takes us through the kit.\n\nCorrective Comment: The Sony 2K monitors, as used at Swanwick/Prestwick, are not vector graphics displays. The PDP11/34s were more than a 'graphics card' they were Radar Display Processors which handled selection of the required radar data streams from the 12 odd available and also handled the inputs from the various control panels on the controller suite. The 11/34s originally drove as Sector Equipment Group which converted the digital data to vector data to drive the original displays, once the Ericsson displays where introduced they had the SEG functionality built in and were therefore driven directly by the 11/34.
