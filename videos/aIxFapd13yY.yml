description: 'Interactive systems can be easily made foolproof and practical, but joy and delight all too often elude the final product. This author of two books on design process and interactive patterns has discovered that strict adherence to these same processes or patterns can result directly in functional, but ultimately boring interactive products. In this discussion, you will learn how to avoid the safe answer, while still embracing proven patterns, best practices and user feedback. You will also discuss how to recognize this problem, the principles to avoid these pitfalls, and how to implement tactics to encourage innovative design for your users, and that works within your organization.'
