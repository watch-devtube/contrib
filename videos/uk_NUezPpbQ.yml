title: 'Last Mile Blockchain Decentralization - Richard Myers'
recordingDate: 1546955797
description: "Globally decentralized protocols like Bittorrent, Bitcoin and Tor provide users a remarkable level of censorship resistance, privacy and communication freedom. \n\nBut highly centralized local communication networks can block, throttle and log users of these protocols and work with governments and private firms to surveil and harass users. \n\nCentralized communication networks historically tend toward rent-seeking behavior, do a poor job at serving last-mile communities, and are fragile during natural and manmade disasters. \n\nThis talk will review decentralized alternatives for local communication and demonstrate a new open source solution called TxTenna for sending offline Bitcoin transactions over a mobile mesh network.\n\nRichard Myers is a decentralized applications engineer at Brooklyn based goTenna and a co-founder of Swedish startup Bytabit AB. Richard organized the first Malmö Bitcoin Users Meetup in 2013 and is passionate about tools that empower decentralized societies.\n_____________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \n\nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \n\nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
