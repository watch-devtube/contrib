description: "In the upcoming Java EE 8 release, there is a new kid on the block: Model-View-Controller (MVC) 1.0. It’s not a replacement for the other web framework, JavaServer Faces (JSF), but it offers an alternative, more traditional, action-based approach that’s more like Spring MVC. Because MVC doesn’t provide a component model like JSF does, you can use it with any front-end technology you like. One of the emerging standards for building rich UIs in the browser is HTML5 Web Components, and Google’s Polymer project implements it and provides additional features for building powerful applications. This session shows how to build a modern web application by using these bleeding-edge technologies together.\n\nSpeaker:\nKito Mann, Principal Consultant, Virtua, Inc.\nKito D.
