description: "Google has recently open-sourced its framework for machine learning and neural networks called Tensorflow. With this new tool, deep machine learning transitions from an area of research into mainstream software engineering. In this session, we will teach you how to choose the right neural network for your problem and how to make it behave. Familiarity with differential equations is no longer required. Instead, a couple of lines ofTensorflow Python, and a bag of \"tricks of the trade\" will do the job. No previous Python knowledge required.\n\nMartin Görner is passionate about science, technology, coding, algorithms and everything in between. He graduated from Mines Paris Tech, enjoyed his first engineering years in the computer architecture group of ST Microlectronics and then spent the next 11 years shaping the nascent eBook market, starting with the Mobipocket startup, which later became the software part of the Amazon Kindle and its mobile variants. He joined Google Developer Relations in 2011 and now focuses on parallel processing and machine learning.\n\n[CKK-4126]"
