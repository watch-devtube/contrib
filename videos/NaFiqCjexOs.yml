description: "What are the characteristics of a good software engineer? It’s a topic many people would argue endlessly about. This is not surprising given we are effectively living in the era of software alchemy.\n\nSome of the best programmers draw on a strong scientific and engineering background. They combine this with craft like coding skills in a virtuous feedback cycle. In this talk we look back at the history of Software Engineering then explore the individual practices and techniques that can help bring out the engineer in you.\n\nMartin is a Java Champion with over 2 decades of experience building complex and high-performance computing systems. He is most recently known for his work on Aeron and SBE. Previously at LMAX he was the co-founder and CTO when he created the Disruptor. Prior to LMAX Martin worked for Betfair, three different content companies wrestling with the world largest product catalogues, and was a lead on some of the most significant C++ and Java systems of the 1990s in the automotive and finance domains.\n\nHe blogs at mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com, and can be found giving training courses on performance and concurrency when he is not cutting code to make systems better.\n\nFor more on YOW!
