description: "Aiming for Production Ready K8s Clusters with CFCR - Morena De Liddo & Bengt Gadelha Hammarlund, Pivotal\n\nKubernetes offers an extensive set of features that can provide for different purposes, ranging from test deployments on localhost to deployments with heavy ML computations on GPUs. It can get overwhelming to figure out the specific features, or combinations of features, which may be needed for making a secure and resilient service. CFCR is an open source wrapper around Kubernetes that provides an opinionated K8S deployment, leveraging BOSH functionalities like scaling and self-healing. It offers a subset of Kubernetes features enriched by some functionalities of BOSH, and facilitates an easy learning curve. In this talk, we intend to explore what can make a K8s cluster ‘production ready’ for different business and how CFCR helps reduce the complexity of spinning a K8s cluster and surface only the most commonly used features.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/GATJ/aiming-for-production-ready-k8s-clusters-with-cfcr-morena-de-liddo-bengt-gadelha-hammarlund-pivotal"
