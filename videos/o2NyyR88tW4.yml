recordingDate: 1433505785
description: "In this panel session, Web container security experts offer and discuss their views on the state of Java Web application security. The discussion focuses on security mechanisms or facilities that members of the panel think should be provided by the Web container or the Web APIs to provide relief from commonly occurring Web application vulnerabilities that are either known or expected to be exploited, to the significant detriment of the vulnerable applications. The discussion will attempt to get a handle on what is feasible to do within the container on behalf of applications and what problems (if any) require more-direct involvement of the application developer.\n\n\nAuthors:\nRonald Monzillo\nJava EE and Servlet Security Architect.
