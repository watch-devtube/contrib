title: 'Go & Microservices - Matt Heath'

description: "With low overheads and excellent concurrency, Go is a great language to build low latency server applications, which makes it perfect for microservice architectures. In addition to this, its simplicity improves developer productivity across larger teams, helping developers quickly get up to speed, and focus on tackling real problems, instead of on the language.\n\nIn this session we’ll look at how Monzo, a digital bank, have used Go to build their core banking systems as a collection of microservices; allowing them to quickly react to changing business conditions, while providing highly available, low latency, critical financial services to half a million customers. We’ll also look at some of the real world complexities and challenges they have faced, and the patterns and techniques they’ve found useful along the way."
