description: "We work in one of the fastest-moving industries the world has ever known. Things are invented, change, grow old and get abandoned in the space of a few years. The user interfaces we were proud of when I started my career are museum pieces now. And the pace keeps accelerating.\nYou need to have an idea of what's going to change over the coming years, and a plan to make sure you don't get left behind. I think about this a lot (mainly when I should be sleeping), so I'm going to tell you what I think the next ten years are going to look like, what changes we can expect, and what we can start doing right now to make sure we're still all kinds of awesome in 2027."
