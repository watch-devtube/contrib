description: "Google Tech Talks\nJanuary 11, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nDatabase indices provide a non-discriminative navigational infrastructure to localize tuples of interest. Their maintenance cost is taken during database updates. In this work, we study the complementary approach, addressing index maintenance as part of query processing using continuous physical reorganization, i.e., cracking the database into manageable pieces. The motivation is that by automatically organizing data they way users request it, we can achieve fast access and the much desired self-organized behavior. This talk is based on the paper presented at CIDR2007.  Credits: Speaker:Stratos Idreos"
