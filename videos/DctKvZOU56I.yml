title: 'KotlinConf 2017 - Sharing [Kotlin code across platforms] is Caring! by Eugenio Marletti'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510747847
description: "Sharing code across platforms is one of the most annoying \"unsolved problems\" when developing a product: an eternal struggle between re-writing everything multiple times and jumping through plenty of hoops to be able to re-use some core business logic. This session illustrates how Kotlin is being used to solve this problem at Clue in order to share code between Android, iOS and the backend, including all the challenges, lessons and tricks learned along the way.\n\nStuck in a love/hate relationship with the green droid. Made in Italy, grown on the Web, currently proud Berliner."
