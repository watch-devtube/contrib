description: "We would like to present dart2js, our Dart-to-JavaScript compiler. We have implemented many optimization techniques and in this talk we would like to present some of them. In particular we want to discuss tree-shaking, speculative optimizations, and local SSA-based optimizations. While our compiler is specialized for Dart, most of the optimization techniques could be adapted for other languages and are therefore interesting to anyone targeting JavaScript as a compilation target.\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
