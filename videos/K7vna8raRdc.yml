description: "Google Tech Talks\nApril, 17 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe will discuss the nature of play, how play in the preschool pre-structures habits of mind that are required by creative adults, and how these precursors can be supported by the sensitive parent or teacher. The talk will be divided into two hours: the first hour can be an exposition of ideas, the second can be a dialogue with the audience. We can prepare the participants with advanced provocations using the Google intra-network, perhaps giving them links to some digital video examples.\n2. Define how the \"Tech Talk\" is a \"Tech Talk.\" The hook here could be that to truly understand the subtleties of play, one needs tools such as those that allow one to annotate video. Parents already add captions to the family album. We could extend this \"family album\" idea to something like ... something like \"From My Face to Our Place: Digital Video as the New Family Album: A Tool for Understanding Our Children.\" We could add the power of \"search\" to the digital history of one's own family. \n\nSpeaker: Dr. George Forman\nGeorge Forman, Chief Executive Officer and Professor Emeritus at the University of Massachusetts retired in 2002 to found Videatives, Inc.
