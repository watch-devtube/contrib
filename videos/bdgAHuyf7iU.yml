description: "As technology leaders, we spend endless hours on solution design reviews, costing, project management & vendor contracts... yet we rarely spend enough time on the thing that has the biggest multiplier impact: your people architecture. This session will be a worked example of how restructuring an organisation to address a significant Theory of Constraints issue achieved results beyond what was expected, and used architecture concepts to get the technology teams on board and help improve autonomy and engagement.\n\nChris leads a service division at Healthdirect Australia, overseeing the delivery of the National Health Service Directories. With 15 years in digital leadership, Chris has lead software and infrastructure/ops teams across APAC, delivering to banking, retail, airline, health & entertainment industries. He is a passionate believer that your people & culture are the foundation for delivering great results.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
