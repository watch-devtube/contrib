description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nAdopting Kotlin is a great opportunity to learn something new as a team. When learning we tried different approaches - from an hour of learning Kotlin, to improving our code reviews to focus on learning.\n\nLast year our team made the leap to using Kotlin in production - what worked? What didn’t? How did we keep the collaboration momentum going?\n\nHear about how learning a new language as a team made us more open to asking questions, admitting things we didn’t know, prevented imposter syndrome and improved our engineering culture, process and code.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nMaria Neumayer is an Android (or Kotlin) Developer working at Deliveroo. She's been developing for Android since 2010 with a focus on UI work. Austrian expat living in London. Previously at Citymapper, Path, Saffron Digital and Rummble.\n\nAmal Kakaiya is an engineer working on Android at Deliveroo in London. He's been coding professionally since 2012. Hailing from Glasgow, Scotland, Amal is also a keen triathlete and when not at a computer can be found cycling, running or swimming in and around East London."
