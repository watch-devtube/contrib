description: "Can machine vision map humans from videos to 3D Models? Yes! DensePose is a new architecture by the team at Facebook AI research  that does just that. It uses a convolutional network with some special features like region of interest pooling and cascading to make this happen. It was also trained on a newly created labeled dataset that mapped human poses to 3D models. The team open sourced the dataset but not the code, but using the details in the paper we can recreate their results. I'll explain how it works in this video.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/3D_Pose_Estimation\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
