title: 'Modular Module Systems: A Survey (Northeast Scala Symposium)'
recordingDate: 1335203931
description: "In this video from NEScala, Chris League will investigate the facilities in various languages for higher-order programming-in-the-large. Scala developers often borrow from Haskell, but what more can we learn from the ML family? What about (heaven forbid) C++ and its template libraries? Do dynamically-typed languages enable more sophisticated code recombination and reuse? Chris will ask these questions, answer some of them, and generally compare, contrast, and encode all sorts of modularity with Scala. \n\n** More resources on scala development at http://marakana.com"
