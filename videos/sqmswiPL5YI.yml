description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nDeep Learning, in addition to being a world class tool for detecting the presence of cats, requires large amounts of data for training. As much vendors may say \"no data prep required\", they are all excessively optimistic*. This talk will look tools to build a deep learning pipeline with feature prep on top of existing big data technologies without rewriting your code for on-line serving.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
