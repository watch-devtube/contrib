description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA\nSpeakers: Smitha Gudur, Manoj Joshi, Redbasin Networks\nCancer/life science drug research models are very rich in relationships, relationship heterogeneity and entity inter-dependencies. Most entity metadata is dynamic and unpredictable making it difficult to fit such models in traditional relational landscape. Redbasin Networks uses a hybrid Nosql strategy that supports composite and rich document metadata that is interconnected pervasively. Cancer and life science data is excessively nested. You will find this useful if you are building complex engineering and/or scientific applications, and need insights on how to merge data from many diverse data-sets and map it to an intuitive and effective graph database model.\n\nWe will show using code examples how complex metadata can be engineered using Spring, Neo4J and Mongo, to create useful drug insights for the drug researcher, and also provide a platform for technologists to build sophisticated life science applications."
