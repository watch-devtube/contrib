Explain Time Series and it’s related concepts\n\n7. Perform Text Mining and Sentimental analysis\n\n8. Gain expertise to handle business in the future, living the present\n\n9. Work on a Real Life Project on Big Data Analytics using Python and gain Hands-on Project Experience\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n \n\nWhy learn Python?\n\nProgrammers love Python because of how fast and easy it is to use. Python cuts development time in half with its simple to read syntax and easy compilation feature. Debugging your programs is a breeze in Python with its built in debugger. Using Python makes Programmers more productive and their programs ultimately better. Python continues to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations.\n\nPython runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS and has been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. Python is free to use, even for the commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license.\n\nPython has evolved as the most preferred Language for Data Analytics and the increasing search trends on python also indicates that Python is the next \"Big Thing\" and a must for Professionals in the Data Analytics domain.\n\nFor online Data Science training, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free) for more information."
