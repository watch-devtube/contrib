description: "We would like to go over a code-on-demand platform that we have developed for our customers. The platform works best for microservices or new feature development. \n\nCustomers input the user stories and acceptance criteria that they need to be developed, and provide us access to their code base and/or APIs. We then go to work for them and turn around code in 24-48 hours. Customers only pay once code has passed through their acceptance testing process.\n\nSpeaker: Mohamed Ali, Root NYC\nRecorded At SpringOne Platform 2017."
