title: 'An introduction to Machine Learning using LEGO - Jeppe Tornfeldt Sørensen'
language: English
recordingDate: 1581940010
description: "Where do you start when you want to learn Machine Learning? Do you start by learning some advanced algorithms or perhaps a Machine Learning framework? In this talk, I will show an alternative approach on how to get started with Machine Learning by using a LEGO car as a model. By using Machine Learning, we can make the LEGO car steer autonomously!\n\nIn the process of making a LEGO car steer autonomously I will go through the following topics:\n- What is Machine Learning?\n- Can we make the LEGO car steer autonomously without Machine Learning?\n- How does the basic theory behind Machine Learning work?\n- How do we connect theory to LEGO bricks?\n\nThe aim of this talk is not to make you an expert in Machine Learning, however, it will hopefully inspire you to investigate and get familiar with Machine Learning in a playful and simple way.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
