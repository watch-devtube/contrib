description: "Everyone has blindspots. For developers it is often taking for granted certain technical skill sets. So what happens when you need to build a system for people without those skills? How do you adjust? What do you use as a reference point for common knowledge? How do you get out of your own head?\n\nThis talk will tell a story of a project where we attempted to do just that. What we learned. What challenges we faced. And how our final system took into account all of our experiences."
