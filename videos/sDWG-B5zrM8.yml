description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Guillaume LaForge\nCore Groovy Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/groovy-in-thelightofjava8\nWith Java 8 out the door, Java developers can, at last, benefit from the long-awaited lambdas, to taste the newly-found functional flavor of the language.
