description: "Get the Code: http://goo.gl/RrA3a\n\nIn this part of my code refactoring tutorial, I'll show you how to eliminate duplicate code using the template method pattern.\n\nWhen objects perform similar steps in the same order, that is a sign that a template method is needed. To use it implement the similar code in a template method and allow subclasses to override the behavior that varies."
