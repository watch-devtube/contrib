description: "Mathematics is its own language, and not enough people speak this language. I'm going to show you some key steps necessary for you to be able to read any math equation. Memorization techniques, grammar, structure, rules, it all comes together to help you form an intuition around the language of the Universe. Machine Learning, cryptography, robotics, all of the cool topics in Computer Science use math heavily so its best to master it when you can. I'll go over 2 my thought process of analyzing 2 equations for some papers to give you some insight into how I think about these things. \n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
