description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2017 #flinkforward\n\nAris Kyriakos Koliopoulos,  Scala Team Lead at Drivetribe \n\nDrivetribe is the world’s digital hub for motoring, as envisioned by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May. The Drivetribe platform was designed ground up with high scalability in mind. Built on top of the Event Sourcing/CQRS pattern, the platform uses Apache Kafka as its source of truth and Apache Flink as its processing backbone. This talk aims to introduce the architecture, and elaborate on how common problems in social media, such as counting big numbers and dealing with outliers, can be resolved by a healthy mix of Flink and functional programming.\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/FlinkForward/flink-forward-berlin-2017-aris-kyriakos-koliopoulos-drivetribes-kappa-architecture-with-apache-flink\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
