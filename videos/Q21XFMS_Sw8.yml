description: "by Kieran Kunhya\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/media_rist.webm\n\n\nThis presentation will explain RIST (Reliable Internet Stream Transport), a new protocol for professional video transport that is evolutionary. It is a protocol designed to allow for packet retransmissions between broadcast equipment, something which in the past had been vendor specific. Unusually for professional standards, it has a public specification and thus has already been implemented in a number of open source projects. This talk will took about the good parts and the bad parts as well as comparing it with traditional transport protocols such as TCP. \n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 14:00:00+01"
