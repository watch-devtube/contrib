description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nKarsten Telling - Software Architect at Systematic and Source of Ideas\n\nABSTRACT\n In the highly competitive market of toady's software development there is a need for constant change, or more precisely a constant need for newness. Newness obtained through creativity. As we like butter on our bread, creativity should also lead to products. Innovation is a combination of creativity and a final output.\n\nIt is our experience that product discovery is not effective in the context of the agile manifesto; hence our focus on innovation methodologies. This allows for discovery of new products and concepts early in the product value chain. Is the combination of having creative methodologies for idea and product discovery combined with the agile development transforming the ideas into real user products an effective way of achieving innovation?\nThis talk is a story about the failures and success in the effort of introducing a more innovative approach. We will take a look at the company wide innovation days, prototyping team, and customer driven innovation initiatives.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
