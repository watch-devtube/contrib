description: "Kirk Pepperdine, Director, Kodewerk Ltd.\nClement Escoffier, Software Engineer, Red Hat\n\nAt the beginning of this year, this session’s speakers had an interesting problem: how to take the core engine of their desktop GC analysis tooling and move it to a distributed server environment where they wanted to analyze live traffic from hundreds of JVMs. The framework they finally settled on was Vert.x, an event-driven, nonblocking framework that enabled them to neatly fracture their core engine and distribute it in a matter of a couple of weeks of effort. In this session, they share with you what it took to integrate Vert.x into Censum."
