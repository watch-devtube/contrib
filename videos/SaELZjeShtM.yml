description: "Brian Wong (Kiip): It’s All About the Moment\n\nBeing at the right place at the right time is no longer just for love – it’s emerging as the best and most successful way to engage with your audience. More consumers, especially millennials, are making purchasing decisions based on feelings, vibes and more importantly, moments – so why is our advertising still tied to traffic numbers and irrelevant data? How do we use moments, both micro and macro, to get in front of consumers? And with so many moments happening at once, how do you pick which moments to target and scale for the masses?\n\nIn this session, Brian Wong of Kiip will speak to programmatically addressing consumer needs in the moments they’re living, in the forms they’re using.\n\nThe speech was given on 2017-05-18 at infoShare 2017 (Inspire Stage) in Gdańsk.\nhttp://infoshare.pl\n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
