description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015.\nTrack: Web / Javascript Track\nSpeaker: Andy Wilkinson\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/documenting-restful-apis\nAn API's documentation is a vital part of making it easy to understand and easy to use. RESTful APIs are no different. In this talk we'll look at what should be included in your RESTful API's documentation and, just as importantly, what should be omitted. Using real-word examples, both good and bad, we'll discuss how the documentation should be structured so that it's informative, succinct, and easy to read. Having identified what good documentation looks like, we'll discuss some of the tools that are available for documenting services built using Spring. In particular, we'll look at some of the problems and limitations of choosing a tool like Swagger and how some alternatives, including Spring REST Docs, avoid these shortcomings and help you to produce documentation that your users will love."
