description: "Functional Programming You Already Know\n\nFrom JVM to .NET languages, from minor coding idioms to system-level architectures, functional programming is enjoying a long overdue surge in interest. Functional programming is certainly not a new idea and, although not apparently as mainstream as object-oriented and procedural programming, many of its concepts are also more familiar than many programmers believe. This talk examines functional and declarative programming styles from the point of view of coding patterns, little languages and programming techniques already familiar to many programmers."
