recordingDate: 1543956883
description: "Ivan Yamshchikov, Researcher, Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences\nPresented at MLconf 2018\nAbstract: We created an EP of four songs where the texts were created by a neural network trained to resemble Kurt Cobain (who would have been 50 in 2017). We have generated the lyrics and recorded the music and Rob Carrol (an independent musician from New York) sang the generated lyrics. During the training we used concatenated embeddings that but for the standard word2vec representation of the word also included it’s transcription (so that the network could learn phonetics), the author of the document and other meta-information.
