title: 'YOW! Data 2018 - Gareth Jones - Using Sentiment Analysis To Fill In The Gaps From User Surveys'
language: English
recordingDate: 1531267201
description: "We put a year's worth of online help chat logs from a major Australian Superannuation website through Google's Natural Language API, to see what insights we could gain from the users. This talk will discuss how the Natural Language API works, and the underlying machine learning concepts, and also give you some ideas on how to make use of the information based on examples from our work. We'll compare the sentiment values with those expressed in exit surveys and find out how useful an indicator it can be.\n\nGareth is a developer with 20 years experience. He lives in Melbourne, working on Big Data, Machine Learning, and other buzzwords. He maintains the popular(ish) node.js logging package log4js-node.\n\nFor more on YOW!
