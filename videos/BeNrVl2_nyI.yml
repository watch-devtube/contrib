description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nAdrian Cockcroft - Technology Fellow at Battery Ventures and Former Netflix Cloud Architect Pioneer\n\nABSTRACT\nTo deliver software products at high velocity requires four things. First, a culture of innovation that can see and respond to opportunities. Second, the data and analytics to evaluate alternatives. Third, a culture that can make decisions and assign resources quickly. Fourth, agile development and self service deployment. A fine grain loosely coupled architecture scales as the team size grows, a freedom and responsibility culture provides autonomy for innovation and fast decision making, unstructured \"Big Data\" analytics gets answers quickly, cloud removes the latency of resource allocation, and DevOps removes the coordination latency that slows down deployment. Traditional enterprise architectures are based on monolithic applications and relational databases. Cloud native architectures are based on buiding single function REST-based microservices that support integration across denormalized NoSQL data stores and a wide range of web services. This talk will also discuss strategies, patterns and pathways to perform a gradual migration towards cloud native.\n\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
