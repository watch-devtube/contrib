In order to implement this feature, we’ve had to invent a myriad of new language features, including scalable features for static reflection, the ability to inject partial definitions classes, namespaces, and functions, and the ability to clone and inject (with modifications) existing declarations. All of these capabilities are a precursor to supporting metaclasses.\n\nIn this talk, we present the background of this work, the constraints under which the features were designed, and the current status of our work. We will discuss many of the new language features that we’ve created, by giving examples to show how they might be used. Finally, we’ll explain how these metaprogramming features support metaclasses and explain how metaclasses can be used as a new kind of tool for library developers.\n— \nAndrew Sutton\nLock3 Software, LLC\nOwner\nKent, Ohio\n\nAndrew Sutton is an owner of Lock3 Software, LLC, a software research and development company in Kent, Ohio. His spends his days working on C++ language extensions in Clang and GCC and working on various WG21 language proposals.\n\nHis past work included the design, specification, and implementation (in GCC) of concepts along with Bjarne Stroustrup and Gabriel Dos Reis. His current big project is language support for reflection and generative metaprogramming, which directly support Herb Sutter's metaclass proposal.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
