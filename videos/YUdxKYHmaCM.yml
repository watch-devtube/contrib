description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nSpeaker: Chris Harris\nThis talk will introduce the Spring Data MongoDB project. Spring Data MongoDB provides a feature rich library for writing MongoDB applications in Java. It builds upon the Spring Framework and as such promotes a POJO programming model with a strong emphasis on productivity.\n\nThe Spring MongoDB Project provides a rich object mapper, a MongoTemplate helper class to simplify common document access operations using query, criteria, and update DSLs, automatic repository interface implementations, QueryDSL integration, and cross-store persistence."
