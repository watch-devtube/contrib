description: "This will be an overview of the Pixie programming language. We will start with a few words about the niche that Pixie is trying to fill and then move on to the main features of the language, including: excellent C interop, immutable data structures, lightning-fast startup times, \"good-enough\" execution performance, and async-by-default io. We will also touch briefly on the technology (RPython) that has enabled Pixie to grow from nothing to a usable language in less than a year, and yet still support the major *nix OSes as well as run on x86 and ARM.\n\nTimothy Baldridge\nCOGNITECT\n@timbaldridge\n\nTimothy is a developer with Cognitect Inc.
