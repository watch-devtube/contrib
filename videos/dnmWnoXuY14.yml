description: "Hans-Henry Sandbaek and Florian Kirmaier discusses JPRO. \n\nJPRO represents a new and disruptive technology that enables java programs to run in standard web-browsers without any need of a plugin. jpro lets java programmers write applications based on ONE source that can target a variety of platforms, including desktops, mobile devices AND standard web browsers. Attendees will learn how to use Java to interoperate with or as an alternative to, popular web technologies such as Angular js for developing large business applications running as Oracle Cloud Services."
