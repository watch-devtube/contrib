description: "The Case for Value Stream Architecture\n\nMik Kersten, Founder & CEO, Tasktop \nCarmen DeArdo, Technology Director, Nationwide \n\nOrg charts and software architecture are the best representation of value creation we have. They are failing us and we know it. Software investment and staffing decisions are made anecdotally, using static and stale slivers of data.\n\nWhat if we could take an fMRI of the organization?\n\nWhat if we could see the flow of business value in real-time?\n\nSee evidence of bottlenecks use them to prioritize IT investment?\n\nRe-architect our software and organization around maximizing flow?\n\nHypothesis test based on real-time data from every team?\n\nThis talks makes this case and also provides Guidance around:\n1) Framework focused on end-to-end business value flow\n2) Definition of a new role in the organization\n3) Set of metrics for measuring flow\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
