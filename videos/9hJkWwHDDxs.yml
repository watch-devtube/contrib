description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nThis talk takes the “ultimately practical” approach to concurrent programming, with a focus on lock-free programs: after all, in reality such programs are almost always written in the hopes of getting better performance. We’re going to measure performance of the individual concurrent primitives and their effect on the overall performance of the whole program.\n\nThe goal of the talk is two-fold. On one hand, I will show a set of tools and practices that can be used to get quantitative measurements of the performance of different implementations under various load conditions. Mastering these techniques will allow the attendees to choose their concurrent algorithms and implementations based on solid data instead of guesswork or “common knowledge” (which is often wrong or outdated). On the other hand, even with the focus on real-life applications we can learn a few things about the fundamental nature of concurrent programs. This understanding comes especially useful when dealing with the “common knowledge” and “simple logic”. For example, it’s “common knowledge” that lock-free programs are faster than lock-based (not always). It’s also a “simple logic” that the hardware must protect shared memory access in a multi-core system, so ultimately locking is always present (sometimes true, sometimes true but misleading, and sometimes false). It is both “common knowledge” and “simple logic” that a wait-free program does not wait (but if your definition of wait is “will I have to wait for the results after I finish my coffee?” then it definitely does).\n\nWe will explore practical examples of (mostly) lock-free data structures, with actual implementations and performance measurements. Even if the specific limitations and simplifying assumptions used in this talk do not apply to your problem, the key point to take away is how to find such assumptions and take advantage of them in your specific application: after all, in reality it’s almost always about performance.\n— \nFedor Pikus\nMentor Graphics\nChief Engineering Scientist\nPortland, Oregon Area\nFedor G Pikus is a Chief Engineering Scientist in the Design to Silicon division of Mentor Graphics Corp. His earlier positions included a Senior Software Engineer at Google and a Chief Software Architect for Calibre PERC, LVS, DFM at Mentor Graphics. He joined Mentor Graphics in 1998 when he made a switch from academic research in computational physics to software industry. His responsibilities as a Chief Scientist include planning long-term technical direction of Calibre products, directing and training the engineers who work on these products, design and architecture of the software, and research in new design and software technologies. Fedor has over 25 patents and over 90 papers and conference presentations on physics, EDA, software design, and C++ language.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
