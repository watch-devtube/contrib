description: "by Jay Lee and Andrew Hobden\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.208/rust_beyond_first_steps.webm\n\n\nThere is plenty of content available to teach you the first steps in Rust… But what about after? \n\nWhat are good resources? how can you leverage generated documentation instead of just tutorials and books? How can you manage the trade-offs in API design? We’ll look at some content and examples, both old and new, worth consuming and talk about their key ideas. \n\nThen, we’ll spend some time talking about some ways to refine your APIs, measure the impact of optimizations, reduce mental overhead on your developers, and tools to help you dig into the heart of your code (flamegraphs, metrics, failure injection, debugging). Agenda: \n\n\n5 min: A Brief Introduction (to help with context)\n10-15 mins: Content Resources\nRust Conference/Meetup Videos\nGreat Articles\nRFCs (and how to figure them out)\n5 mins: Flexible/Optional Parameters\n5 mins: Linearizable Types &amp; #[must_use]\n(Optional, or pick any/all) 5 mins: Flamegraphs (Flamer) OR Prometheus (rust-prometheus) OR Debugging (lldb/VS Code).\n\n\n\nRoom: UD2.208 (Decroly)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:50:00+01"
