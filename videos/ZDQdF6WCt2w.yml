title: 'YOW! 2016 Caitie McCaffrey - The Verification of a Distributed System'
recordingDate: 1488938133
description: "Distributed Systems are difficult to build and test for two main reasons: partial failure & asynchrony. These two realities of distributed systems must be addressed to create a correct system, and often times the resulting systems have a high degree of complexity. Because of this complexity, testing and verifying these systems is critically important. In this talk we will discuss strategies for proving a system is correct, like formal methods, and less strenuous methods of testing which can help increase our confidence that our systems are doing the right thing.\n\nCaitie McCaffrey is a Backend Brat and Distributed Systems Diva at Twitter. Prior to that, she spent the majority of her career building large-scale services and systems that power the entertainment industry at 343 Industries, Microsoft Game Studios, and HBO. Caitie has a degree in Computer Science from Cornell University, and has worked on several video games including Gears of War 2, Gears of War 3, Halo 4, and Halo 5 She maintains a blog at CaitieM.com and frequently discusses technology on Twitter @Caitie\n\nFor more on YOW!
