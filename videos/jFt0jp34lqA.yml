description: "Keynote presented by Casey Hadden, Software Developer and Architect, SAS.\n\nSAS is a software vendor with 35+ years of industry history (and 35+ years of software decisions). From mainframes, Unix workstations, and client-server to web applications, big data, and cloud; one constant has been the changing computing environment. Throughout these eras, SAS software and the SAS business has adapted to each change in order to deliver valuable analytics to our customers.\n\nWith cloud environments firmly ensconced and PaaS gaining traction every day, how does SAS rework its software and business again to compete and thrive in this environment? How can SAS help to fill in the 'Analytics' portion of an enterprise PaaS strategy?"
