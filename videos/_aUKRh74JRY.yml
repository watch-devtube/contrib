description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/evilpacket/security-first-adam-baldwin\nSecurity isn't one of those things you just bolt on after the fact. It's not another department or third-party that takes care of those things for you. Security of an app is a developers responsibility. Your responsibility.\n\nThis talk will discuss the cross roads between security and development, the security of features you are going to build into almost every app, common pitfalls, examples of bad implementations and of course recommendations of how to do them right.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/adam-baldwin-security-first.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
