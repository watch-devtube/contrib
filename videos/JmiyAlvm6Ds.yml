description: "Get the Code: http://goo.gl/LF15W\n\nIn this part of the Java Video Tutorial, I introduce the last Swing component called the JTree. I won't just be introducing the JTree however. I will also be reviewing much of what you have learned.\n\nIt is my belief that if you see tools being used in many different ways, that you will just remember them. I will review dimensions, frames, panels, buttons, scroll bars, listeners and so much more."
