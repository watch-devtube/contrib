Adam Nash (LinkedIn), Daniel Raffel (Yahoo), Chris Messina (Google), Angus Logan (Microsoft), Ryan Sarver (Twitter), and Chris Cole (MySpace) will discuss the importance of such emerging technologies, how they've adopted them in their products and debate what's next. Kara Swisher will moderate. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
