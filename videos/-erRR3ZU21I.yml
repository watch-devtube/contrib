description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012.\nSpeaker: Jeremy Grelle\nWeb and mobile clients are getting continually more sophisticated as client processing power continues to increase and much richer APIs are provided by the given platform. One of the most mind-bending shifts that is occurring is in transitioning from a world of purely request-response, to the world of client-server full duplex communication that is enabled by the latest smart client platforms.\n\nThis session will explore the new patterns of interaction that are enabled by the latest communication methods such as WebSockets and Push-to-Device services, as well as the practical concerns of actually implementing such patterns in an application using tools such as SockJS, RabbitMQ and Spring."
