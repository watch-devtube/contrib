title: 'Peanut Butter and Chocolate: Integrating Hadoop with SQL Server - Kevin Feasel'
recordingDate: 1506326707
description: "So you jumped on the bandwagon and set up a Hadoop cluster…but now what? Your database developers and app developers know how to integrate with and develop against SQL Server, but the Hadoop world is a completely different experience.\n\nThis talk will help bridge the gap between SQL Server and Hadoop, using tools such as SQL Server Integration Services and Sqoop to migrate data between a Hadoop cluster and a SQL Server instance, as well as PolyBase to integrate the two like never before."
