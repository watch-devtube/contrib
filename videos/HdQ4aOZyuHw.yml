description: "From security to performance to GPU programming: exploring modern allocators\n\nhttp://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nWant to make fast linked lists? Want to store sensitive data in memory? Want to place std::unordered_map in thread-local memory? Shared memory? How about GPU memory? You can do that in today’s C++ with allocators, the secret components of every STL container. Allocators went through a quiet revolution in C++11 and a major expansion in C++17. What did that give us? We'll look at the allocators available today in C++17, boost, TBB, and other popular libraries, and demonstrate some of the amazing things that can be achieved by taking the step beyond the stack and the heap. \nThis talk is not about allocator implementation, but is a showcase of the things that can be done with off-the-shelf allocators available now and with C++17.\n— \nSergey Zubkov: Morgan Stanley\n\nSergey is a former biochemistry researcher and OS developer, who now works in finance and spends his free time editing cppreference.com and helping out with the C++ Core Guidelines.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
