description: "Making developers on support work for everyone\n\nOftentimes, the choice for a smaller startup is between hiring no one for technical support and just letting the developers/founders field all questions or hiring a support person and expecting them to handle it all (while that poor support person sits alone, feeling dreadfully concerned about “bothering the developers”). Using her Medium post, “Eyes Wide Widened: My ‘Evolving View’ of Developers on Support” as a starting point, Clubhouse’s Customer Success Lead, Camille Acey will talk about how to implement a “Some Hands Support” system (as opposed to an “All Hands” system) so that Support can leverage some of the developers on the team, some of the time. She will also cover strategies for creating and iterating on a process and selecting the right “collaborators” from the developer team so that the experience benefits the users, the product, and the organization.\n\nABOUT CAMILLE ACEY\n\nCamille E. Acey is the Customer Success Lead at Clubhouse Software, and for the last six years she has worked in user-facing roles at tech organizations. Over the past two decades and across two continents, Camille has committed herself to projects that draw in new people, promote unique ideas, and foster cooperation. She is also a dedicated 24/7 support person to a precocious and demanding three year-old boy. You can find her talking startups, support, and social justice as @kavbojka on Twitter.\n\n--\n\nWhen you’re busy leading a team, coding and maintaining standards, how do you find the time to stay ahead of new technologies and develop yourself as a technical lead?\n\nThe Lead Developer conference features practical advice from experts on leading and motivating your team and high-level sessions on new and disruptive technologies.\n\nGet tickets at theleaddeveloper.com"
