description: "Leap Motion has recently released an innovative sensor that enables hand and finger movements and gestures to be tracked in three dimensions to millimeter accuracy. The development kit includes a Java API that can easily be integrated into new and existing Java and JavaFX applications. This session looks at the principles behind the Leap Motion sensor and delves into the Java API, with plenty of example code for different use scenarios. Because JavaFX 8 will include 3-D rendering support, the presentation also shows how it can be integrated with the Leap Motion sensor to create some really stunning applications.\n\n\nAuthors:\nSimon Ritter\nSimon Ritter is head of Java Technology Evangelism at Oracle Corporation.
