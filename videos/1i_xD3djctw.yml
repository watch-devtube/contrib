description: "In this highly rated session from Strata Rx 2012 four prominent disruptors in the health data field - DJ Patil, John Mattison, Tim O'Reilly, and Benjamin West - discuss how they think big data will impact the future of healthcare. Topics discussed include:\n\n    What do we want healthcare to look like in 2020?\n    What are the current barriers to innovation and how should we address them?\n    How will big data allow us get the best patient outcomes?\n    Will robots and algorithms eventually replace the physician?\n    What are some of the big things we should be thinking about to make evidence-based care a reality?\n    Why will data democratization and open standards create an \"entrepreneurial firestorm\"?\n    What kind of visualization tools are needed to help patients better manage their own health?\n    By 2020, what do you want a system or device to be able to tell you about yourself?\n    Should we be concerned about the loss of privacy that comes along with an increased use of open data?\n\nDJ Patill is the \"Data Scientist in Residence\" at Greylock Partners.\n\nPreviously he was the Chief Product Officer for Color and the Chief Scientist at the LinkedIn Corporation, leading the Analytics and Data Teams. Some of the products shipped include, People You May Know, Who's Viewed My Profile, Talent Match, Skills, and Career Explorer.\n\nJohn Mattison is the Chief Medical Information Officer and Assistant Medical Director at Kaiser-Permanente, Southern California. He began his medical career at UC San Diego and Scripps Clinic, where he practiced in diverse clinical settings including emergency services, primary care, critical care, preventive medicine, hyperbaric medicine, trauma and helicopter medicine.\n\nTim O'Reilly is the founder and CEO of O'Reilly Media. His original business plan was \"interesting work for interesting people,\" and that's worked out pretty well. He publishes books, runs conferences, invests in early-stage startups, urges companies to create more value than they capture, and tries to change the world by spreading and amplifying the knowledge of innovators.\n\nBenjamin West is author of insulaudit, an open source project to read historical logs from medical devices like glucose meters and insulin pumps. During the course of this research, he discovered that clever auditing techniques could allow avoiding situations leading to adverse events that are common throughout therapy. Ever since, his hacking has been bent toward increasing \"fidelity of care."
