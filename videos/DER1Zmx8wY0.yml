recordingDate: 1418863698
description: "This event originally aired June 17, 2014.  Monty Python's Flying Circus had a \"cat detector van\" so, in this webcast, we use Python to make our very own cat detector and recognizer. More generally, we cover the process of training a detector for any class of object and a recognizer for any unique objects. Our recognizer can learn new objects interactively in real time.\n\nThis project is a chapter in my upcoming book, OpenCV for Secret Agents, which can be considered an advanced sequel to my previous OpenCV books.\n\nAbout Joseph Howse\n\nJoseph Howse has four first-rate cats, yet if his books sell well, he could build a menagerie fit for a pharaoh.\n\nWhen not writing books or grooming cats, Joseph is working to grow the augmented reality industry by providing software development and training services through his company, Nummist Media (http://nummist.com). \n\nDon't miss an upload!
