description: "NEW SERIES! We're... building... an... ONLINE BUSINESS! Prepare for 105%-crash-and-burn total failure. It'll be FUN and we'll LEARN a lot! Expect: \n? Business model\n? Sales\n?? Code\n? Testing\n?? Deployment\n? Marketing\n? Failure\n? Minimal chance of Success. ?\n\nBut who cares!! We'll learn a lot from this!\n\nIn this episode, David discusses the AFFILIATE MODEL and sets up a rough PLAN. He also sketches out the idea of the site and draws a wireframe in Sketch.\n\nFirst though, as all \"startups\", we need a NAME. Write your domain suggestion in the comments. Requirements:\n?? Name\n?? Available .com\n\nLet's get to it!"
