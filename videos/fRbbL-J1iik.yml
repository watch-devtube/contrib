description: "Memory leaks and other memory exhaustion situations are frequent enemies of Java application developers and administrators. They can crash your application or make it unbearably slow. This tutorial explains different ways to monitor the memory usage of Java applications and how to distinguish between normal and critical situations. It also addresses what information is necessary and when and how to collect it to start solving memory-usage-related problems in your application. You’ll also learn what a memory dump is and how to use it. The presentation also briefly discusses what class loader leaks are and how they differ from object leaks. The session ends with a brief discussion of what other tools are available and if they are useful.\n\n\nAuthor:\nNikita Salnikov-Tarnovski\nCo-founder of Plumbr, the memory leak detection product, where he now contributes as core developer.
