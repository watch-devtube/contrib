recordingDate: 1475932891
description: "In his presentation, speaker Mikael Sahlström, will walk us through the typical architecture of a modern car. From the different Engine Control Units (ECU's) to the various busses and communication lines between components and onto the infotainment systems we've come to love in modern times, finally ending with the internet connectivity we've become reliant upon for added functionality in our vehicles.\n\nAll of these components come with their own challenges especially from a security perspective.\n\nAnother important aspect of modern cars are the myriads of sensors available in them, and the massive quantities of data collection this leads to.\n\nFinally, we will be looking into the perfect storm of all these factors that lead to the infamous hacking of the Jeep vehicles, which let hackers take over a vehicle and remotely disable it.\n\nSpeaker Mikael Sahlström has been working with developing security products for the last 3 years, previously with Advenica and now currently employed with Bosch.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
