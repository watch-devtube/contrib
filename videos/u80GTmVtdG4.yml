title: 'The power of technical decisions - Jake Ginnivan'
recordingDate: 1518518216
description: "We often think of technical decisions as what the tech does or how does it compare with others, but they can be so much more. Technical decisions can shape culture, attract certain types of people to join your company, motivate people and more.\n\n18 months ago The West Australian took control of it's digital destiny by building a team of passionate technologists, setting them up on the newsroom floor and tasked them with creating their own publishing platform to stay relevant in the rapidly changing news and publishing industry.\n\nIn this session Jake will be sharing the lessons learnt and the challenges encountered in building a technology startup inside a newsroom founded over 180 years ago, from cutting-edge technologies chosen, to team culture and values, to negotiating the political landscape. All of which were greatly affected by our technical decisions along the way."
