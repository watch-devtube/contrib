recordingDate: 1513257269
description: "HoloLens breached a barrier, a barrier between the digital and the real world, bringing digital content into our world.\nOver the past year the HoloLens has continued to create new ways to visualize, to change education and the medical industry.\nHoloLens is not only for games it is a Business platform (that is game enabled)\nUsing Unity we can create an experience that lets you bring digital content and interact with the real world.\nDuring this session we will take a look at the HoloLens hardware, the possibilities, the limitations and tooling.\nWe will take a look at the basics of Unity and also create a HoloLens app from scratch complete with Gaze, Air Tap, Spatial mapping and Voice using Mixed Reality Toolkit.\n\nEver since Jimmy Engström got his first ZX Spectrum at the age of 7 he hasn't stopped programming. During the day he is a .NET developer and he does all the fun stuff during his spare time. Together with his wife he also runs a company \"Azm dev\" which is focused on HoloLens and Windows development. He is really passionate about Windows development, HoloLens or well you could say the .NET platform really. He and his wife also runs a code intensive user group (Coding After Work) that focuses on helping participants with code and design problems, and a podcast with the same name. Back in 2011 he received the \"geek of the year\" award, a title well deserved. He is certainly living up to the title with everything from developing and gadgets to superheroes and cosplaying at the sci-fi faire. He speaks at various types of events including NDC, Devsum, hackathons, Swetugg, Øredev and TechDays which led to him becoming a Microsoft MVP in Windows Development.\n__________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
