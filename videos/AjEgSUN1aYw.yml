description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nNetwork Isolation and Security Policies for Kubernetes Bare-metal Nodes - Girish Moodalbail, NVIDIA & Liel Shoshan, Mellanox \n\nRunning Kubernetes at scale in a multi-tenant Cloud requires strong network isolation and flexible stateful security policy enforcement for the bare-metal nodes used for both the tenant K8s clusters as well as in the Cloud control plane. Such isolation and security needs to be implemented in a way that consumes as little host resources as possible, while being immune to potentially malicious host root user. Additionally, the preferred implementation needs to be compatible with a high-performance (offloaded) K8s CNI. This presentation provides an overview of such an implementation for Software Defined (SDN) K8s node networking, based on Open Virtual Network (OVN) and Open vSwitch (OVS)) and offloaded to “bump-in-the-wire” Smart NICs.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zetj"
