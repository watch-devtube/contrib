title: 'NoSQL, WTF! Let’s Talk NewSQL'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784666
description: "Enterprise Java developers moved from traditional RDBMS solutions such as Oracle Database and MySQL to NoSQL solutions such as Cassandra, MongoDB, and CouchDB to achieve elasticity, but for a hefty price: ACID properties. It seemed like a fair price to pay at the time. But not anymore. Here comes  NewSQL —the best of both worlds. The NewSQL solutions aim to deliver the same scalability, elasticity, and performance while still maintaining the ACID properties of a traditional single-node RDBMS. NuoDB is gaining a lot of popularity in this domain. Volt DB is another good example. This presentation goes into the architectural and implementation details of the NewSQL database paradigm and discusses why it is time to think beyond NoSQL.\n\n\nAuthor:\nKarthik Shyamsunder\nKarthik Shyamsunder is a Principal Engineer at VeriSign Inc. where he architects and building distributed computing applications for VeriSign products and services.\n\nKarthik also serves as an adjunct faculty at Johns Hopkins University teaching graduate level courses in Distributed computing covering courses like Enterprise Computing using Java, Rich Internet Applications using AJAX, Distributed Computing on WWW.
