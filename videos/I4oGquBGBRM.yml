language: English
recordingDate: 1575504701
description: "\"Over the last 2 years we've analyzed and reverse-engineered a plethora of IoT-enabled surveillance cameras and spy cameras analyzing their app behaviors, cloud storage, network communications, data-at-rest, and hardware. In this spy vs. spy presentation, we reveal the unforeseen dark side of using these devices and their full capabilities. Wired and wireless packet captures will be analyzed, as well as the use of open source tools for anomalous behavior analysis substantiating the risks surrounding these devices. We then outline methods for fortifying their deployment and minimizing unwanted eavesdroppers. Remember that spy camera you just plugged in, maybe the method by which someone else is spying on you. \"\n\nBio:\nMichael T.
