description: "If you work at a small, cool company, you can skip this talk. The rest of us in large, slow moving companies that rely on meetings, email, and inbox 2,000 to get the daily work done need some therapy and advice for thriving in big, \"dumb\" companies. I've worked in such companies and figured out how to thrive in the \"back to back meetings\" world we're taught to avoid. I'll tell you my tactics.\n\nIdeally, you’d adapt the no manager GitHub dream, adapt the Spotify and Netflix cultures of awesomeness. Indeed. However, oftentimes there are good reasons to stay in the relatively dysfunctional companies you’re at. They’re big, slow moving, and seem to use Microsoft Office as their core innovation engine.\n\nIf people at your work always talk about “aircraft carriers” this is the talk for you."
