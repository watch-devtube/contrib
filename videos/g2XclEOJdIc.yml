description: "Google I/O 2010 - GWT's UI overhaul: UiBinder, ClientBundle, and Layout Panels \r\n\r\nGWT 201 \r\n\r\nJoel Webber, Ray Ryan \r\n\r\nThere have been some really huge improvements in GWT's UI fundamentals over the past year. We've introduced features such as UiBinder, ClientBundle, CssResource, and über layout panels that allow you to build fast UIs in a sane manner. Come see how fun/easy/fast it can be to use these technologies in harmony to overhaul your UI. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
