description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/java-buildpack-developer-enhancements\n\nOver the years, the Java Experience team has worked hard to ensure that Cloud Foundry was the best place to run Java applications in the cloud. As that support has matured we’ve turned our attention to the developer experience. In this session, you’ll hear from the lead developer of the buildpack about the new support for JMX access, debugging, and profiling. Rounding out this session will be a short tour of other production features added recently."
