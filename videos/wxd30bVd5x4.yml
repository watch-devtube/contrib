recordingDate: 1551275385
description: "In this talk, Ran is very practical and explains the methodology of the tests used at Wix Engineering. He goes bottom-up, starting with unit tests and what we really want to cover, moves on to component tests and finally with E2E and integration tests. He also covers how to handle legacy code (code with no coverage), and how to achieve full coverage.\n\nBio:\nSoftware Engineer at Wix, Mobile developer, iOS developer, and React Native advocate for the last 3 years, striving to make React Native a strong and first choice platform. Passionate about OSS, code, and knowledge sharing."
