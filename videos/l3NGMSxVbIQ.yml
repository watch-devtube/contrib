description: "\"Fall in Love in Human, or Why Engineers are the Best Designers\"\n\nThis will be about user experience. Not an usual boasting of how designers solve the world and users’ problems, but rather, how engineers do it. And how they can do it. And why they need to do it. And how they did it during the history, when best user experience was happening as a byproduct of a just great product design.\n\nMotocykl OSA, slicing bread machine, or Pad-Thai dish are among many others non-designers products, that has been producing great user experiences for their users. Yet, no designer was involved, however those items were perfectly designed by engineers to solve particular problems. And were beautiful.\n\nI’d like to convince software engineers, that they don’t need to wait for a designer to start influencing good user experience. UX is not only about visual design, but also about credibility, findability, accessibility, etc.\n\nHowever, I’d also like to give some tips how to work collaboratively between developers and designers, why those two roles should blend. And why talking to users is a fascinating opportunity to become better developer.\n\nAnd a little bit of humor, as usual."
