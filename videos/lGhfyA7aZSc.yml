description: "How do you feel when you forget your phone? If, like Laurent, you feel lost, you are probably also living in a world where devices are augmenting you and making you more connected, more efficient and more skilled (or is it addicted?).\nIn this session, Laurent Bugnion, geek, developer and gadget addict will show you next generation devices and the collaboration between them. From smartphones to smartwatches, from IOT and phablets to XBOX and Surface Hub, from Cortana to HoloLens, we live in a world of devices where software is coming out of the computer more and more. We'll take a quick look at the past, a good look at the present and a glance at the future with lots of demos. This is not your usual technical talk, but rather a sociological discussion of how devices change us, and how we can benefit from them. With demos of Cortana, collaboration between devices, Windows 10 Continuum, Microsoft HoloLens."
