description: "James Ford - Chief Architect, ADP\n\nIce Cream cones and Chicken Nuggets, help us visualize the break up of the monolith. The challenge becomes about how far do we need to go…. Don’t be fooled by the 12 factor crowd or the cloud nativists, there are benefits for cloud immigrants.

It presents an overview of the progress to date, the idealized automation pipeline and the desired end state."
