description: "In Java a typical workflow involves restarting the application with almost every class change. For some applications that’s not a problem; for others, it’s a disaster. This session explores the options available for Java class reloading. There are plenty of tools for this task—JVM HotSwap, dynamic class loaders, OSGi, and reloading agents—and every option has its own drawbacks and benefits. This session provides a deep dive into the subject. There are also the conceptual challenges to reloading Java classes. What to do with the state? What should happen with the static initializers? What if super class changes? This session also offers a better understanding of class reloading technologies that can help you become more productive Java developer.\n\nDownload his slides at https://developer.oracle.com/code/prague under his session available in the agenda"
