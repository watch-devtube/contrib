description: "Implementing Agile in small, short lived projects is easy. The real challenge comes when the project becomes long-running, and it gets even harder when spanning into multiple large projects. Add the challenge of distribution of resources and different cultures and it becomes almost impossible.\n\nJan-Erik Sandberg is an international veteran on successfully implementing Agile in large organizations. You will get insights into some of his hard earned experiences and this hour will be packed with proven techniques and real life examples. The goal of the session is to help you to reduce risk and increase your chances of succeeding with implementing agile at a large scale. Project and product-developments that utilize offshore resources will be the main focus for this session."
