description: "www.ng-conf.org\n\nng-conf is a two day, single track conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 500 to 700 Developers from across the country will converge on beautiful Salt Lake City, UT to participate in training sessions by the Google Angular team, and other Angular experts. In addition to the invaluable training, ng-conf will deliver a premier conference experience for attendees, providing opportunities to network with other developers, relax at social events, and engage in some of the unique entertainment opportunities available in Utah.\n\nJohn Papa\nTopic: Progressive Saving\n\nQuite often we force users to to save or cancel data, before moving on when what they really want is to leave the page in a changed state and come back to their work in progress later, perhaps after closing the browser. This requires change tracking, local storage, serializing and rehydrating complex object graphs, not to mention visual indicators to improve the user experience. Come learn how when AngularJS meets BreezeJS we can light up this scenario."
