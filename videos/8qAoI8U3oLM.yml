This dream involves the transformation of several monolithic silos into a slick, unified storefront with a platform of microservices, deployed onto Cloud Foundry. Iterating into a new culture with the help of Pivotal Labs, CoreLogic embraced the concept of extreme programming to support a cultural change from waterfall to agile with a need to quickly train seasoned employees and attract motivated new talent. And, in order to enhance the pool of new ideas, diverse collaboration from across the globe is needed. \nThe Solution: Remote Paired Programming \nWe will take you through the evolution of a small team of pairs, some of which are located in a single location while others are scattered across the U.S., and recently in Kiev. Highlights of our journey include: \n1. Evolving support tools and devices that assist us in our changing environment (monitors/displays, cameras, speaker phones, headsets) \n2. Coordinating across time zones to ensure the process is not interrupted (standups, IPM, optimized story backlog) \n3. Share Everything: Remote pairs have to be able to control the workstation, write code, and have access to all the tools required just like the local pair (proper video conferencing and screen-sharing) \n4. Test driven development and adhering to pairing patterns \n5. Courtesy & Respect: Verify good communications, think out loud, handling local side conversations by always including the remote pair, and taking breaks \n6. Navigating around the naysayers by selling our new culture with rapidly built, high quality products/services \n\nConclusion? To be determined. Literally. We are an ever-evolving work in progress and excited every day to see what comes next.\n\nSpeakers:\nKathy Ellison\nOracle Database Administrator / Software Developer, CoreLogic\nMichael Stuart\nPrin, Software Architect, CoreLogic\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
