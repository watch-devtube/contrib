description: "This talk is an Experience Report sharing the highs, and the lows, from the first few months of building Xinja - Australia's first digital bank, designed entirely for mobile. A talk from two perspectives; both Business (Van Le - Customer Innovation Director, Xinja) and Technology (Phil Parker - Partner, Equal Experts) will share the journey we are going on… warts and all!\nWe will share how we manage priorities when developing with our customers (shout out to our founding Xinjas!), how developing a startup does not mean being technology lightweights (or cowboys) and how we manage to be effective with a highly distributed, global team.\n\nPhil Parker is a partner with Equal Experts, a role which affords him a huge amount of variety in his day-to-day work. He enjoys advising on organisational leadership, product/process assessment and reviews, running new project inceptions and getting directly involved with product delivery (even coding - if his team allows it!).\n\nVan is an expert in customer experience design and has worked with clients in financial services, telecommunications, higher education and energy, not only in CXD but also in public policy, regulatory strategy, organisational change & transformation, business development, operational excellence,  product development, and leadership and resilience programs.  She has an MBA, lectures at UNSW, and is a former lawyer & public servant.  Van sits on SDN Children’s Services research and ethics committee and has two kids.  She grew up in Perth, arriving in Australia as an 11 month old refugee.  \nVan is passionate about creating opportunities beyond what people see possible for themselves.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
