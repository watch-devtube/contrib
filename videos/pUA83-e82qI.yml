description: "Debugging applications in production is like being the detective in a crime movie. Especially with microservices. Especially with containers. Especially in the cloud. Trying to see what’s going on in a production deployment at scale is impossible without proper tools! Google has spent over a decade deploying containerized Java applications at unprecedented scale and the infrastructure and tools developed by Google have made it uniquely possible to manage, troubleshoot, and debug, at scale.\n\nJoin this session to see how you can diagnose and troubleshoot production issues w/ out of the box Kubernetes tools, as well as getting insight from the ecosystem with Weave Scope, JFrog Artifactory & Stackdriver tools.\n\n# Ray Tsang \nRay is a Developer Advocate for the Google Cloud Platform. Ray had extensive hands on cross-industry enterprise systems integration delivery and management experiences during his time at Accenture, managed full stack application development, DevOps, and ITOps. Ray specialized in middleware, big data, and PaaS products during his time at Red Hat while contributing to open source projects, such as Infinispan. Aside from technology, Ray enjoys traveling and adventures.\n\n# Baruch Sadogursky \nBaruch Sadogursky (a.k.a JBaruch) is the Developer Advocate at JFrog where he has made a profession of speaking about the company’s products: Artifactory, the Universal Artifact Repository; Bintray - the Universal Distribution Platform; Xray, Universal Component Analysis and Mission Control, Centralized Control and Management.\n\nFor a living he hangs out with JFrog’s tech leaders, writes code around the JFrog Platform and its ecosystem, and then speaks and blogs about it all. He has been doing this for the last dozen years or so, and enjoys every minute of it.\n\nHe is a professional conference speaker on DevOps, Java and Groovy topics, and is a regular at the most prestigious events including JavaOne, Devoxx, OSCON, Qcon and others."
