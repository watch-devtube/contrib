description: "Google Tech Talks\nDecember 5, 2006\n\nABSTRACT\n\nGraphics processing units (GPUs), designed to produce images ranging from scenes in computer games to CAT scan results, have become computational powerhouses capable of hundreds of gigaflops per second. As computational power has increased, so has flexibility and programmability, allowing GPUs to be applied in new ways in both graphics and non-graphics applications.\n\nI will review the architecture of recent GPUs and the traditional software interfaces to them, as well as present a new interface from ATI that more closely reflects current GPU design and use.
