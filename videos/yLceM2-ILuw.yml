description: "Istio service mesh has a control plane that is responsible for configuring the proxies, enforcing policies, and observing communication through telemetry collection. According to Istio security best practices, securing the control plane should be as important as securing what’s in the mesh.\n\nIn this webinar, we will explore security and segmentation strategies and practices for operating applications and services using Istio, with an emphasis on sensitive data processing apps."
