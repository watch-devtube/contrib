recordingDate: 1497021523
description: 'Have you ever thought about how much of software engineering involves explaining things? We stick comments in our program to explain why we added X to Y, we write README files to explain the program, and we spend the afternoon explaining the whole thing to the new person. A decent explanation can be the difference between success and obscurity. In this talk Russ Olsen will run through the things that you can do to craft explanations that are clear, engaging and perhaps even a bit funny. Russ will do his best to be clear, engaging and perhaps a bit funny.'
