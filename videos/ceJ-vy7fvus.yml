description: "Tom Manderson\n\nhttps://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45392-task-queues-a-celery-story/\n\nPython has a surprisingly large number of task queue libraries, but Celery reigns supreme. Unfortunately, there are a few use cases where it's remarkably bad. Learn about why you might want a task queue (and when you definitely don't), when Celery is appropriate, and what you can do when it's not.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, australia, programming, sydney\n\nThis video is licensed under CC BY 3.0 AU - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\r\n\r\nPyCon Australia (“PyCon AU”) is the national conference for the Python Programming Community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers with a love for developing with Python.\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU"
