title: 'Cloud, Distributed, Embedded: Erlang in the Heterogeneous Computing World - Omer Kilic'
language: English
recordingDate: 1400770979
description: "The future of computing will be heterogeneous and the traditional tools we are used to will not be able to handle the different paradigms required when developing for these systems. This talk will provide a brief overview of heterogeneous computing and discuss how Erlang can help with the orchestration of different processing platforms, using our latest experiment on the Parallella platform as a case study.\n\nThis talk will also introduce Erlang/ALE, our new framework for embedded systems and provide an update on the Erlang Embedded project.\n\nTalk objectives: To provide an overview of some of the research projects we have been working on at Erlang Solutions in the field of embedded and heterogeneous systems.\n\nTarget audience: Hardware and software engineers interested in computer architectures, heterogeneous computing and hardware hacking."
