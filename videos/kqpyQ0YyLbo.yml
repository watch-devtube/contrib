title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2012: Stefan Pohl - Efficient Scoring in Lucene'
recordingDate: 1545060406
description: "Efficient query processing is important for end-user experience (small response times) and business (handle high loads cheaply). Moreover, requirements are amplified in mobile use-cases, such as those of Nokia Maps, where much latency is inherent due to the communication medium itself. This talk delves into Lucene's query processing and sketches a scoring algorithm which can be implemented on top of primitives readily available in Lucene and by way of which practically significant reductions in query processing costs can be attained.\n\nMore Info: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/efficient-scoring-lucene\n\nDescription of Stefan Pohl: \nhttps://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/stefan-pohl"
