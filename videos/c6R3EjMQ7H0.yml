description: "This video will get you up and running with your first API-based chatbot able to converse with a user around a topic of your choosing!\n\nThe code for this video is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/API_Chatbot\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nAPI.AI (My favorite Chatbot API):\nhttps://api.ai/\n\nNuance Mix:\nhttps://developer.nuance.com/mix\n\nWit.Ai:\nhttps://wit.ai/home\n\nSiriKit:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/sirikit/\n\nChatbots are all about recognizing intent i.e what is the user saying to me? I thought this paper was really fascinating. It's called \"Toward Computational Recognition of Humorous Intent\":\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Julia_Taylor2/publication/228353850_Toward_computational_recognition_of_humorous_intent/links/0deec53b55d7fd4782000000.pdf \n\nI love you guys!
