title: 'How shit works: Time - Tomer Gabel'
recordingDate: 1500792380
description: "This talk, the third in his series, breaks the mold to take a hard look at one of the most commonly used, and at least as commonly misunderstood, elements in software engineering: time. Time is so fundamental to the way humans experience reality that we don't normally give it a second thought, but it's just as fundamental to software systems. Without a correct model for working with time BAD THINGS HAPPEN: data is persisted out of order, exceptions occur where they shouldn't be possible, and production systems blow up.\nIn this talk, Tomer covers the various common representations of time, acknowledges their caveats and deficiencies, and hopefully you’ll a few new tools and practices along the way."
