description: 'BlueTooth is everywhere, it is in all of our pockets and the only protection most use is not being in discoverable mode. This will be a talk on enumeration, tracking non-discoverable Bluetooth devices, as well as an operators perspective on some awesome use cases for Blue_Sonar. Of course it is already in Pentoo. This talk is imperative for those in the WCTF, because you will need this tool to find many of the BlueTooth foxes.'
