description: "Intro: Telepresence - Rafael Schloming, Datawire & Adnan Abdulhussein, Bitnami \n\nHow do you set up a productive development environment on Kubernetes? With microservices and cloud databases, creating a local development environment is very complex. In this talk, we’ll cover the different approaches to developing services on Kubernetes. We’ll then introduce Telepresence and show how it can be used to enable local development of Kubernetes services. We’ll cover how Telepresence is used for real-world development of the Kubeapps project. We’ll take a peek under the hood to show how Telepresence works. We’ll finally wrap with a discussion of the Telepresence roadmap. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrbM"
