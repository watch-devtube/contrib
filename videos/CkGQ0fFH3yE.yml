One of the best ways to do that is by end-to-end (E2E) testing our code as it simulates the real actions of our beloved users. Let’s be frank though, E2E testing is notoriously time-consuming, expensive, slow, and often flaky. Unfortunately, these issues lead to developers doing very little to no E2E testing, and taking solace in a plethora of unit-tests that cannot fully test the intended experience of users.\n\nWe can do better. We should do better. We will do better.\n\nWe’ll explore modern tools and libraries, such as Cypress, that enable us to easily and beautifully write flake-free, reliable, deterministic E2E tests for our web applications. E2E tests will give us confidence in the software we ship down the wire.\n\nAmir Rustamzadeh From Cypress.io\nAmir Rustamzadeh is a classically trained electrical engineer that just couldn't shake his urges of building for the web. He's experienced in developing mission critical systems for the aerospace industry, and other large enterprises, but now enjoys his days working on Cypress, an open-source tool for building higher quality software for the web."
