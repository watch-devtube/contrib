title: 'Everything you want to know about C/C++ pre-processor but couldn''t ask - Jon Jagger'
recordingDate: 1539170030
description: "The C/C++ pre-processor can do more than you probably think it can. Quite a lot more. In fact, it's almost certainly Turing complete.\nIn this talk we'll start by looking at some standard examples of using the pre-processor, and how to avoid some of its more common traps and pitfalls.\n\nWe'll quickly move on to examine some decidedly non-standard examples. The pre-processor has some well known restrictions which we'll have work our way around them, sometimes using ingenious techniques, sometimes using brute force.\n\nWe'll end by writing FizzBuzz entirely in the pre-processor.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences \nhttps://ndctechtown.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
