description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nParsec: A New Platform Abstraction for Security - Hugues de Valon, Arm\n\nParsec is the Platform Abstraction for Security, an open-source initiative that aims to create simple, standardised, ergonomic software interfaces for interacting with hardware-backed security features on any platform in any programming language. Parsec enables key management and cryptographic services to be consumed on rich, multi-tenant platforms to protect Cloud Native deployments in a way that is agnostic with respect to the underlying hardware. This talk will give an overview of the Parsec project as well as its involvement in the Rust community making it easier to interface with HSMs, TPMs and PSA Crypto!"
