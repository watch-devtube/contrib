description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nA big part of accelerating development and promoting collaboration often translates to deferring a lot of the typical programmer work to a scripting language, to allow for those with more design-oriented ideas and experience to handle some of the workload. What happens, then, when you have to bind a scripting language like Lua into C++ to allow for this workflow? \n\nThis session is going to be all about how you enable non-developers and developers alike to rapidly increase their development productivity by turning routines and algorithms into data that can be shipped alongside your product in Lua. We will talk primarily how you can use the library sol2 to abstract away the muck of working with the Lua C API and instead focus on using and describing both Lua and C++ with each other in a simple manner. We will demonstrate some of the more interesting properties of sol such as Overloading Support, Container Support, Usertypes -- C++ classes made available with automatic support for unique/shared pointers -- and Tables. \n\nBy the time this session is over, you will have a firm grasp over what a good Lua Binding can offer you, and how you can accelerate your C++ development with it.\n— \nJeanHeyd Meneide, Columbia Unviersity\nStudent\n\nJeanHeyd \"ThePhD\" is a student at Columbia University in New York. Most of his programming is for fun and as a hobby, even if his largest open-source contribution -- sol2 -- is used across many industries. He is currently working towards earning his own nickname, climbing the academic ladder while spending as much time as possible contributing to C++ standardization and development. \n\nHe very much loves dogs and hopes to have his own in a year or so. He also likes Vulf's \"Tee Time\" from the album Mr. Finish Line. \n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
