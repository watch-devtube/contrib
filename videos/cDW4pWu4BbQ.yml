description: "A Google TechTalk, 5/13/16, presented by Greg Walsh, University of Baltimore\nABSTRACT: Co-design research with children is a field that continues to find new ground and expand as it explores new, and more effective ways to design. As children become more enveloped in a world of technology and video games, it follows to leverage these kinds of experiences for use in our design toolbox. In addition, continuing to explore how to include a larger global audience through distributed co-design can advance the design process. This talk focuses on our experiences at the University of Baltimore in trying to develop new ways to work with more children by focusing on those that live in Baltimore City."
