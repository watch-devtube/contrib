title: 'The Typescript Dilemma with Gil Amran (Hebrew)'
recordingDate: 1456672429
description: "In this Video, Gil Amran - Tech Lead for Wix Stores - breaks the myth that there are no types in JS. He explains that though the syntax doesn't force you (the developer) to declare it - you had a type in mind.\nIn the past you had to read the comments, run through the JS.Docs or even dig in the code to find out what the previous developer really meant.\n\nGil also talks about the structured workflow to be gained by using typescript and demonstrates why it doesn't take back from JavaScripts flexibility. Then he dives into the added syntax and shows how it turns out after compiling and explains how and why you should move your project to Typescript gradually."
