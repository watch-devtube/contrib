description: "What's New in the Cloud Foundry Ecosystem? - Alex Zalesov, Altoros   \n\nA lot has changed in the Cloud Foundry ecosystem in the recent year. But how have these changes influenced the everyday life of the platform operations engineer? What has changed in the developer’s workflow? A year ago one needed to provision a virtual machine for the broker—today, a broker can be deployed as an ordinary application. Previously, a developer had to add authentication code to each of the applications—now a single routing service on top of all apps is used. In this talk, Alex will describe the changes accommodated by our engineers interacting with Cloud Foundry on a day-to-day basis. Alex will describe the features that saved us most time, and the ones that increased our confidence in the platform’s ability to self-heal in the face of failure. Also, Alex will touch upon the most anticipated features that we believe will make our lives much easier.\n\nAlex Zalesov\nAltoros\nCloud Foundry Engineer\nMinsk, Belarus\nAleksey Zalesov is a Cloud Foundry/DevOps Engineer at Altoros.
