description: "What's more important to the culture of an Internet startup: pixels, programming, or teamwork? For Tim Van Damme, Instagram's Head of Design, it's a combination of all three. This talk covers Tim's introduction to design, his obsessions with the web and iPhone, and his path to the photo-sharing app that currently serves a community of 100 million active users. \n\nThis conversation, guided heavily by Q&A, is an excellent reference for both the technical programmer and technology enthusiast. Whether you're a developer or designer, student or entrepreneur, or just an Instagrammer, you're sure to gain a lot from Tim's perspective on life and mobile apps.\n\n**Check out our stream for free developer resources and content on HTML5: http://marakana.com/s/tags/html5"
