description: "Building React Web and React-Native Apps with Shared Code.\n\nDiving into the feasibility of using a single code base for generating multiple front-end applications.\nWe'll discuss using React and React-Native for building apps that provide a consistent experience across native, mobile and desktop web.\nUsing React and React-Native as the UI layer upon a shared JavaScript core codebase can greatly improve your organisation's delivery of new features to customers.\nWe'll talk about our migration strategy for the new apps replacing our existing apps, piece by piece. Not slowing down our continuous release of features to customers while replace the apps.\n\nTim Sawtell is Mobile Developer at Sportsbet in Melbourne. He focuses on Agile at scale and seeking out innovative technical solutions. \n\nDamon is the engineering lead for web at Sportsbet, specialising in web infrastructure, javascript frameworks and performance. He spends a lot of time thinking about how to get dev teams to deliver apps and features effectively. Damon has worked as a web dev, architect and lead at a range of large scale online applications in Europe and Australia including IG Index, Betfair, ANZ and Sportsbet.\n\nI have worked at Sportsbet for five years, working on its native iOS product all the way from git init, all the way to its latest update. With almost ten years experience working with Apple platforms, I got a start by tutoring Objective-C at university, and eventually graduating into iOS development in industry just as the iPhone SDK came out.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
