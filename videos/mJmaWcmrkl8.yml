description: "Speaker: Laurent Picard (GOOGLE)\n\nIn a previous life, I have shipped generations of devices driven by an infrastructure built from scratch and developed over several years. It has been a long and laborious process. With this presentation, my goal is to inspire developers by showing how easy it now is to build an IoT device with existing technologies, using on-the-shelf inexpensive material and drive it in serverless mode.\n\nLaurent Picard is passionate about software, hardware, science and anything shaping the future. Over 20+ years, he has delivered educational solutions, pioneered the ebook industry, co-founded Bookeen, developed generations of e-reading devices and launched a highly-available ebook ecosystem. Laurent is now developer advocate at Google and enjoys inspiring developers with cloud technologies."
