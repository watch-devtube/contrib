I used CircleCI prior to them becoming a sponsor and I love that their free tier is powerful enough for small personal projects, even if they are private.

It is insanely fast, because it only executes tests affected by your code changes and runs tests in parallel.

Most coding content out there focus on step-by-step tutorials. We think tutorials are too far removed from what everyday development is like. Instead, FFF has created a completely new learning environment where we grow from failure, by solving problems while intensively interacting with a live audience. \n\nTutorials try to solve a problem. Failing Together makes you grow as a developer and coworker.\n\n📹 Each show is recorded live on Twitch in a 2-hour livestream on Mondays. The host, assisted by the audience, is tasked to complete a programming challenge by an expert guest. Like in the real world, we often fail, and learn from it. This, of course, reflects what the audience identifies with, and is one of the most praised aspects of the show. \n\n⏯ On Fridays, an edited version of the show is adapted for and published on YouTube. \n\nContent Topics revolve around: JavaScript, Functional Programming, Software Architecture, Quality Processes, Developer Career and Health, Team Collaboration, Software Development, Project Management\n\nTalk title: Gettin’ into the (Tensor)Flow\n\nFor the past five years, all the cool kids have been doing Machine Learning but as Javascript developers, we have been left out, not really getting invited to all them cool parties. Well, a new decade is on the horizon and it feels like everything is about to change.\n\nLet’s get on a journey together where I introduce the very basics of Machine Learning and Tensorflow.js, some does’ and dont’s, but more importantly, get us all excited about Machine Learning with JavaScript!\n\nWhat do you need to know to be able to follow along?\nThis talk will be inspirational but basic knowledge of Javascript and React Native will increase the “inspiration” multiplier.\n\nRelevance\nThere’s not a better time to start explore Machine Learning due to the fairly recent release of Tensorflow.js and it’s growing community.So gone are the days where you’d need a Major in Machine Learning to pull off the amazing stuff that can now be done with 10 lines of code.\n\nPiérre Reimertz\nPiérre Reimertz can do many things, but writing a bio in 3rd person is not one of them. I love to be creative in all forms of it; code/design/music. Much of my though is put into Nopamine and how to make the web fun again while preserving our privacy. I’m also co-founder of Mavencook, a food startup based in San Francisco."
