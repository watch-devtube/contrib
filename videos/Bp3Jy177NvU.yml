description: "Comparing Angular, Backbone, Ember, Polymer and React.\nWe're all building a client-side framework. And they're all different implementations of the same stuff. I want to compare the approaches that popular frameworks take to solving these patterns. If they even try to solve them at all. I also want to include info about the custom framework that Yammer uses. It'll be illustrative to see how all of these have different approaches to the same set of patterns.\n\nhttp://2014.jsconf.us/"
