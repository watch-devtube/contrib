description: "Real World Experiences: Cloud Foundry on Windows - Steven Benario & Matthew Horan, Pivotal\n\nInterested in building or operating .NET applications on Cloud Foundry, but not sure whether your existing applications are well suited for the platform? In this talk, we will consider the experiences of several real world users of Cloud Foundry on Windows, and dive into the lessons learned in bringing their .NET applications to Production. \n\nWe will look at both greenfield, and legacy applications that have been adapted to run on Cloud Foundry, and examine the patterns that have been successfully utilized to bring these applications to the platform.\n\nAbout Steven Benario\nSteven has spent nearly a decade as a Product Manager, leading products in both large and small organizations across both coasts. After starting his career working at Microsoft on Windows 7 and Windows 8, he went on to several Product Management roles in New York City. Most recently, he was the PM for Windows and .NET support on CF, and currently works at Pivotal to help drive the strategic roadmap for Pivotal Cloud Foundry.\n\nAbout Matthew Horan\nMatthew has spent over a decade developing Web applications. Before becoming a developer, he worked as a systems administrator at various startups as and hosting providers. Having worked with just about every configuration management tool, and being a developer by trade, Matthew was drawn to Cloud Foundry three years ago as it touched on all his interests. He has focused on .NET due to a desire to bring the best practices of Pivotal's Cloud Fonudry platform to a wider audience."
