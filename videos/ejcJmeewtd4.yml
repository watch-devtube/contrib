description: "The story behind Google Docs Offline and some of the fantastic hacks put in place to make it work.

Moving an internet company offline involves some hard work and has some serious challenges (performance, cross-browser compatibility, platform bugs, etc).\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
