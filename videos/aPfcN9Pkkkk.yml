description: "Oh Java, my old, lousy and boilerpalted friend. For ages, trying any thing new (which luckily wasn't that frequent afterall) was to start new project, followed by a Sandbox class and a public static void main method. Alternatively, a simple JUnit test was a nice entrypoint as well - if we were lucky enough to have some dependency management sorted out.\n\nHopefully things changed. With the Java9 a REPL has been added to the JDK. Everybody can just run an up-to-date Java shell and try out new syntax, new APIs, new libraries.\n\nIn this talk I'll walk through how you can use REPL to explore new API and language elements in isolation, try out new libraries, build complete apps with an immediate feedback.\n\n# Jakub Marchwicki\nJakub has been around software development for past 10 years, wearing multiple hats, getting hands dirty in multiple environments, securing both technical as well as the business side of The Thing. “An engineer with a human friendly interface?”. Some languages, some frameworks, blah blah blah - doesn’t matter. Jakub always considered programming as a tool to solve real-life problems - in a pragmatic way. He always stayed closed to business side of the solution, still focusing on the technology. He combines daily job of managing a horde of software engineers at Young Digital Planet with lectures and technical trainings and comittment to Gda?sk Java User Group."
