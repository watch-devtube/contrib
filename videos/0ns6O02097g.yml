description: 'Life of a trader in Westeros isn''t easy. Navigate the fastest path, buy and sell and above all, make a profit. And then, of course, there are Dragons.. This talk, based on the open source training material we''ve made for The Hague University, will explain and visualize various algorithms needed for making a bot that intelligently traverses a map, decides what to buy and where to sell to make a profit. Besides some silly and naive algorithms we''ll be covering A*, Ant Race, and decision trees and making them efficient. Next time you enter a fantasy world, you''ll know what to do!'
