language: English
recordingDate: 1540539659
description: "Frank Munz, Director, Amazon Web Services EMEA\n\nLet’s face it: Kubernetes is the new platform for a modern microservices-based application architecture. However, until now it has been less clear how certain core requirements such as security/policy enforcement, traffic routing, in-depth telemetry, and reporting can be implemented for microservices. This presentation will get you up to date with istio and explain how it compares to the enterprise service bus you have been using for a decade. It includes live demos of istio core concepts that will give you, as a developer, a head start."
