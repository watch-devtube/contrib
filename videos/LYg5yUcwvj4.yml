description: "An Introduction to Cloud Foundry Core Development - Jen Spinney & Luan Santos, SUSE\n\nWelcome to the Cloud Foundry community! This talk is designed for people who are new to the Cloud Foundry community or existing community members who haven't come in contact with core developers and the development practices of Cloud Foundry.\n\nCloud Foundry is proudly open source, and our open source contribution model is a little different from most other open source projects. In this talk, you'll learn about how the Cloud Foundry teams are structured, how they operate, and what a day in the life of a Cloud Foundry core developer looks like. Even if you don't plan to get involved with core development yourself, this talk will help you understand the perspective and terminology of the developers and product managers you may be interacting with. If you do plan on getting involved with core development, this talk will serve as an overview and introduction of what to expect when joining a team or making a pull request.\n\nAbout Luan Santos\nLuan Santos is a Pivotal developer and core contributor to the Cloud Foundry platform. He is a member of the Diego team, located in San Francisco, CA. He also spoke at the CF Summit 2015 in Santa Clara, CA about the Cloud Foundry API.\n\nAbout Jennifer Spinney\nJen Spinney is a Software Engineer at SUSE, who’s worked on core Cloud Foundry teams for over two years, including Diego and CAPI. Previously, she worked for Microsoft for 3 years developing standards and tooling for implementations of REST. She’s given several talks at previous Cloud Foundry Summits."
