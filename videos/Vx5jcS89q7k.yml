recordingDate: 1476779215
description: "Ask one thousand developers how to build a mobile app with JavaScript and you'll get one thousand different answers. The landscape is filled with a mix of platforms, tools, frameworks, libraries, development strategies, runtime environments, and more. Sorting through it all is a daunting task. That's where this presentation comes in.\nLet's go on a journey through the world of mobile development with JavaScript. We'll explore what developers are doing. We'll review the good, the bad, and the ugly. We'll look at tools and runtime environments. We'll even get our hands a little dirty with some code. You'll walk away with a clear understanding of where we're at and where we're headed."
