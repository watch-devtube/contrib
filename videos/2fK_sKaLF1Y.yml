title: 'CloudFoundry or Kubernetes/Kubo: Choosing the Right Platform for the Job by Pieter Humphrey'

description: "There’s a lot of excitement from the CloudFoundry (CF) community around Kubo - Pivotal’s and Google’s engineering project for Kubernetes (K8s) clusters managed by BOSH. While Kubo was just accepted as a CF Incubator project, there’s still a lot of confusion around CloudFoundry x Kubernetes use cases and best usage scenarios for services and cloud applications.\n\nPieter Humphrey has been in Java middleware industry for 17 years, working in development, marketing, sales, and developer relations to advance Java technology in the enterprise, across companies like BEA, Oracle, VMware, and Pivotal. His current role is focused on Spring and Cloud Foundry, but he has years of working with application development tools in both enterprise and open source, speaking at events like Sun Tech Days, Oracle and BEA developer roadshows, JavaOne, and SpringOne2GX."
