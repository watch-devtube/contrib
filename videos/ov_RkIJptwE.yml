description: "Have you ever wondered what the math behind neural networks looks like? What gives them such incredible power? We're going to cover 4 different neural networks in this video to develop an intuition around their basic principles (2 feedforward networks, 1 recurrent network, and a self-organizing map). Prepare yourself, deep learning is coming.\n\nCode for this video (with coding challenge):\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/neural_networks\n\nHammad's winning code:\nhttps://github.com/hammadshaikhha/Math-of-Machine-Learning-Course-by-Siraj/tree/master/Regularization%20in%20Linear%20Regression\n\nOng's runner-up code:\nhttps://github.com/jrios6/Math-of-Intelligence/tree/master/3-Regularization\n\nMore learning resources:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3l4qz76JhQ\nhttp://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/som/som1.html\nhttp://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/\nhttps://iamtrask.github.io/2015/11/15/anyone-can-code-lstm/\nhttp://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOppzHpvTiQ&list=PL2-dafEMk2A7YdKv4XfKpfbTH5z6rEEj3\n\nPlease subscribe!
