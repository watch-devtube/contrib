description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/chandru-mullaparthi\n\nOver the past 20+ years spent writing software for distributed soft real-time systems, I have made every mistake there is to make. I will share some of those in this talk so that you don't have to suffer the way I did waking up at ungodly hours of the night.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- Describe Erlang anti-patterns.\n\nTarget audience:\n\nNew and experienced Erlang developers.\nSlides\nAbout Chandru\n\nChandru worked in the telecoms domain for 19 years, and he spent the last 15 of those years programming in Erlang. In a moment of madness during the Christmas of 2013, he decided to study for an MBA and was relieved to find that at the end he didn't become pointy haired and that he could still write code. And as most telecoms operators have decided to outsource their core competence, he is currently gambling with his future as Principal Software Architect at bet365."
