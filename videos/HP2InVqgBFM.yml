description: "Presentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nThis is the long awaited continuation of a previous CppCon talk (\"Lock-free by Example\") on an \"interesting\" lock-free queue. (\"interesting\"? Well, \"multi-producer, multi-consumer, growing, shrinking, mostly contiguous, lock-free circular queue\" is a bit long. Maybe \"complicated\" is a better word.) \n\nAttendance at the previous talk is completely NOT required. \n\nThis time we will not just review where we left off, but attempt to \"prove\" that what we did is actually correct, and thus discuss how to prove correctness of lock-free algorithms, and discuss provability vs testing. \n\nAnd then, with the first steps proven (or disproven! - and hopefully corrected!), we can continue to expand the features of the queue, and tackle the new challenges that arise. \n\nAlso, this is secretly a talk to convince you not to do lock-free programming. Shhh...\n— \nTony Van Eerd: Christie Digital\n\nAnd maybe coding well for some of that. Lots of pixel++, UX, threading, etc. Previously at Inscriber, Adobe, BlackBerry, he now enables Painting with Light at Christie. He is on the C++ Committee. He is a Ninja and a Jedi. Lock-free is a strange hobby. Follow @tvaneerd if you dare.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
