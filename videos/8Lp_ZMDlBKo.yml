description: 'Planning application architecture is a complex task which requires detailed understanding of the technological platforms you''re targeting. Oliver demonstrates and explains the major steps of the process of creating an architectural concept for a medium size distributed .NET application. From data access over layering concerns to UI platforms, every topic needs to be considered, and this talk summarizes the gist of the technical considerations and a healthy pragmatic philosophy. Oliver lets you participate and benefit from his experiences from project work and consulting - architects, programmers and owners of other job titles are equally welcome!'
