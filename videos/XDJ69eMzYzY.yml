description: "Gold Sponsor Lightning Talk: Let a 1000 Flowers Bloom - Dr. Michael Maximilien, IBM\n\nPlatform-as-a-service (PaaS) has never been more relevant than it is today. The release of various alternative platforms such as Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are proof positive that users and enterprises want an operating system for the cloud that can help them manage their containers and cloud resources. Cloud Foundry (CF) was at the forefront of PaaS and is easily the most adopted cloud platform on the market. However, it faces the classic innovator's dilemma problems that a successful leader experiences, as alternative platforms become viable. To continue to maintain its lead, we believe CF must aggressively innovate, improve, extend and embrace, so that a 1000 cloud innovative \"flowers\" bloom. The CF-Extensions PMC and projects are aiming at exactly that. Come hear the latest status of this new PMC and also how you can contribute your own innovative ideas to this growing garden.\n\nAbout Michael (aka dr.max) Maximilien\nMy name is Michael Maximilien, better known as max or dr.max, and I am a computer scientist with IBM. At IBM Research Triangle Park, I was a principal engineer for the worldwide industry point-of-sale standard: JavaPOS. At IBM Research, some highlights include pioneering research on semantic Web services, mashups, and cloud computing, and platform-as-a-service. I joined the IBM Cloud Labs in 2014 and work closely with Pivotal Inc., to help make the Cloud Found the best PaaS."
