description: "Anders Heijlsberg (father of C#) and Luke Hoban (Microsoft rep to TC39) introduce TypeScript, a new language and toolset that makes it easier to write cross-platform, application-scale JavaScript. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional static types, classes, and modules to JavaScript to enable great tooling and better structuring of large JavaScript applications. The TypeScript compiler is Open Source (Apache 2.0) and written in TypeScript. The compiler outputs standard JavaScript that runs in any browser or any host. The TypeScript language specification is available under the Open Web Foundation's, Final Specification Agreement (OWFa 1.0).\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
