description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nThis session is about a real MQTT-driven IoT stack with several sensors, remote-controlled switches. Via a secured connection to a remote MQTT broker I will show how data measured by microcontroller driven sensors transmitted and then displayed by JavaFX based MQTT applications on different platforms (desktop, embedded and mobile devices) and custom NeoPixel driven gauges."
