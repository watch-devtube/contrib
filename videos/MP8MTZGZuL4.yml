title: 'YOW! Data 2017 Ananth Gundabattula - Low Latency Polyglot Model Scoring using Apache Apex'
recordingDate: 1508720400
description: "Data science is fast becoming a complementary approach and process to solve business challenges today. The explosion of frameworks to help data scientists build models bears a testimony to this. However when a model needs to be turned into a production version in very low latency and enterprise grade environments, there are a very few choices with each one having their own strengths and weaknesses. Adding to this is the current disconnect between a data scientists world which is all about modelling and an engineers world which is about SLAs and service guarantees. A framework like Apache Apex can complement each of these roles and provide constructs for both these worlds. This would help enterprises to drastically cut down the cost of model deployment to production environments.\nThe talk will present Apache Apex as a framework that can enable engineers and data scientists to build low latency enterprise grade applications. We will cover the foundations of Apex that contribute to the low latency processing capabilities of the platform. Subsequently aspects of the platform that make it qualify as an enterprise grade platform are discussed. Finally, we will cover the main aspects of the title of the talk wherein models developed in Java, R and Python can co-exist in the same scoring application framework thus enabling a true polyglot framework.\n\nAnanth is a senior architect at Commonwealth Bank. Prior to CBA, he was part of Threatmetrix passionate about low latency distributed processing frameworks \n\nFor more information on YOW! Data Conference, visit\nhttp://data.yowconference.com.au"
