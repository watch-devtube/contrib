description: 'Willow has been programming since she was seven years old. It started simple, with Scratch, but got more complicated as she learned more languages and platforms. Now, at the age of 12, she is building games in Unity3D with her dad; a long way from making Scratch move up and down on the screen. She hopes to become a world famous game designer, author, movie director, rock guitarist and Wimbledon champion.'
