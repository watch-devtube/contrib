This involves examining auto, rvalue references, range-for loops, uniform initialization, lambda expressions, unique_ptr and shared_ptr, and more.\n--\nHerb Sutter - Author, chair of the ISO C++ committee, software architect at Microsoft.\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
