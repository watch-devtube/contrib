The learning curves can be steep and expectations to excel and deliver are high. How does one cope with all of this? From leaving the banking industry with zero programming knowledge to running automated tests at work using Apache JMeter, Rachel will share tips that have helped her journey in tech, and she hopes that they would help you in yours too!\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker:\r\n\r\nRachel Lee is currently a Software Engineer at SP Group under Quality Engineering. She made a mid-career jump from performing regulatory work in banks to learning web development full-time at General Assembly in 2017. Prior to joining SP Group, Rachel was doing a stint as Quality Assurance at a start-up. Rachel enjoys the challenge of picking up programming languages and frameworks as she navigates the tech industry.\r\n\r\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1chvQ_FRj-yYv7QcS13l7btYEgiCqUT2rYtsaXVxfmBA/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/256113422/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG"
