description: "Using Service Brokers to Bridge CF and Kubernetes - Jeremy Rickard, Microsoft\n\nOne of the great things in Cloud Foundry is the ability to bind your application to external services using service brokers! If you are moving to containerized deployments, you may be considering Kubernetes as your container orchestrator of choice. Will you lose that great benefit if you are moving to Kubernetes? The answer is no! Service Catalog brings the same capabilities to Kubernetes for your containerized applications. In this talk, Jeremy will introduce Service Catalog and talk about how it was influenced by the user experience in Cloud Foundry. He will then show how you can use Service Catalog to deliver your containerized applications to Kubernetes and provide some guidance on best practices for working with both platforms.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyO/services-api-project-update-matt-mcneeney-pivotal-nikolay-maslarski-sap"
