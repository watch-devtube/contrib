recordingDate: 1545383824
description: "Deep neural networks are being used in a number of complex machine learning tasks such as computer vision, natural language processing and speech recognition with immense success. Deep Learning has been hailed as the “next big thing” in recommender systems, and we have started to see deep neural networks deliver on their potential for dramatic improvement in Recommendation Systems technology. The aim of the talk is to present the current state-of-the-art collaborative filtering and content-based methods that use deep learning techniques to provide recommendations.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
