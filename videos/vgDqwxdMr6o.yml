description: "MySQL replication is fairly easy to set up, but in the real world many\r\nobstacles can get in the way of keeping it up and running smoothly.  One\r\nproblem is the slaves getting out of\r\nsync with the master.  If you're lucky you'd be alerted with an error\r\nin your slave log file, and can then track down that problem.  But\r\nsometimes it drifts out of sync silently.  Both are situations you want to\r\navoid.  Sean Hull talks about why this happens, both in terms of things that happen in the application and in MySQL's implementation of statement-based replication. Then he shares a method to eliminate the problem by testing and verifying your current setup."
