Whether you're a musician, a startup or a cause for good, crowdfunding can help you build a devoted community, generate buzz and raise that all important cash to make things happen. Pozible GM Claire Merquita talks lessons learned from $45million worth of successful projects on Pozible.\n\nCrowdfunding is about building a community, breaking away from traditional barriers to entry and raising the cash to help make your passion project become a reality. \n\nWith one of the highest campaign success rates around, Pozible will be sharing what works, what doesn't, and how to give your project the best chances from the start. Whether you have a project in mind, or just want to find out more about crowdfunding, we'd love to share what we know, and help you get from incubating the idea you have to making it happen.\n\nAlso joining us for this sharing session is one of Pozible's success stories, the creators of this super successful campaign: pozible.com/project/205027\n\nBiography:\n\nClaire Merquita has worked as a writer, producer and educator in the media and broadcast industries for the last six years. In Singapore, her work has appeared on television, film, corporate video and collateral, audio tours and the local press.\n\nIn 2014 she moved to Melbourne as Singapore/Malaysia Country Manager for Pozible, Australia’s largest crowdfunding platform.
