title: '""It''s Just Matrix Multiplication": Notation for Weaving" by Lea Albaugh'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540340487
description: "Pattern looms are often thought of as a precursor to computing because weaving has a fundamentally binary structure: when the weft interlaces with the warp, every warp thread is either up or down. However, while computerized loom systems do simply store patterns as a series of binary data, the limitations of simpler looms have given rise to a notational system which includes a couple of layers of misdirection between the input operations and the resulting structure.\n\nIn this talk, I'll cover some basic weaving terminology and hand weaving pattern notation, and show how transformations at the notation level can lead to a surprising amount of patterning complexity. This will culminate in a discussion of \"network drafting,\" a modern style of weaving based on an obscure French math treatise from the 1930's.\n\nLea Albaugh"
