description: "How hard can responsive web be? It sounds simple: design for a number of screen sizes and just throw in several media queries and your website is now \"responsive\"! Unfortunately, this is not the case and responsive web hasn't made our job easier. Adopting responsive web design will force you to change your design, development, and testing workflow. Problems may also arise in different stages of the workflow. In this talk, we will talk about responsive web blunders at Viki, how we overcome it, and some tips on how you can avoid it.\n\nAysha is a front-end engineer and wannabe designer at Viki, where she works closely with the UX team in order to build functional and beautiful UIs on viki.com and Viki's internal tools. When she is not super busy (which is rare these days), she either writes about geeky stuff on her blog renaysha.me or build experimental and pretty things on CodePen (codepen.io/rrenula). She loves design, gaming, dancing, and Yoga.\n\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore - 18 November 2015.\n\nSource: http://2015.cssconf.asia\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/renaysha/responsive-web-bloopers-cssconf-asia-2015-by-aysha-anggraini\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
