description: "By Ken Rimple, Srini Penchikala, and Josh Long\n\nMost of you probably know Spring Roo as the Java-based rapid application development tool that uses AspectJ and a command-line shell to build Spring applications. But underneath those slick commands that set up your application components lurks an even more powerful and extensible platform, one that you can use to build anything you want.\n\nIn this presentation, SpringSource's Josh Long and Spring Roo in Action authors Ken Rimple and Srini Penchikala introduce Spring Roo, 1.2, and then go further, exposing Roo's powerful addon-based underbelly. They introduce Roo's OSGi bundle support, and introduce how add-ons can be used to generate code, install templates, respond to addition / removal of annotations, and expose both open-source and internal-company libraries for use by your developers. Finally, they wrap up by discussing the recently developed Tailor add-on, and will show how it can be used to completely customize your developers' shell environment."
