description: "How CF Networking Could Solve Your Environment Specific Use Case - Konstantinos Karampogias, Swisscom\n\nVery often, Cloud Foundry operators are facing a case which they can only solve in a way that is tightly connected to their internal infrastructure. Any feature request to integrate such environments-specific solutions will inevitably be rejected. In a situation like that, operators have to introduce a dirty workaround, which is not ideal. Adding a custom behavior by extending the network stack will be of great benefit.\n\nIn this talk, Konstantinos presents an extension to the network stack which addresses a known network limitation of the platform. The solution is leveraging the extensibility added by the CF Networking release and the plugin chaining, which is the latest feature of the Container Networking Interface (CNI) community. We will begin with a deep dive into the networking stack. A demo will follow that presents a modified Cloud Foundry that solves the external traffic identification problem. According to which, the space or the org of an application cannot be identified in the transport layer (TCP/UDP) outside the Diego Cell.\n\nAfter this talk, the attendees will\n- Demystify the Cloud Foundry network stack\n- Learn how the CF-networking release enabled extensibility\n- Be introduced to the latest feature of CNI\n- Understand how several problems can be solved in the network stack \n\nAbout Konstantinos Karampogias\nKonstantinos has been working at Swisscom for the past three years as Software Engineer. He is currently remote member of the CFCR team in Dublin, and before that he was member of the Garden team in London, and of the Container Networking team in Santa Monica."
