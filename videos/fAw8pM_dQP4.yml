Python cuts development time in half with its simple to read syntax and easy compilation feature. Debugging your programs is a breeze in Python with its built in debugger. Using Python makes Programmers more productive and their programs ultimately better. Python continues to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations.\nPython runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS and has been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. Python is free to use, even for the commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license. \nPython has evolved as the most preferred Language for Data Analytics and the increasing search trends on python also indicates that Python is the next \"Big Thing\" and a must for Professionals in the Data Analytics domain. \n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1844 230 6362(toll free) or India: +91-90660 20867\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka\n\nCustomer Review\n\nSairaam Varadarajan, Data Evangelist at Medtronic, Tempe, Arizona: \"I took Big Data and Hadoop / Python course and I am planning to take Apache Mahout thus becoming the \"customer of Edureka!\".
