But sometimes the goals of a visualization go beyond that: they need to inspire and engage people. But how do you draw them in? What is the process behind creating a creative data visualization? During this talk, I will show some of my projects, and explain a little about the process behind it.\n\n\n\nPeter Hoffmann - Infrastructure as Python Code: Run your Services on Microsoft Azure\n\n\"Infrastructure as Python Code: Run your Services on Microsoft Azure\n[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - Anfiteatro 1]\n[Rimini, Italy]\n\nUsing Infrastructure-as-Code principles with configuration through machine processable definition files in combination with the adoption of cloud computing provides faster feedback cycles in development/testing and less risk in deployment to production. The Microsoft Azure Cloud (https://azure.microsoft.com/) allows different ways to provision, deploy and run your python  service:\n\n\nThe Azure Resource Manger Templates (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/templates/) allows you to provision your application using a declarative template. With parameters, variables and Azure template functions, the same template can be used to deploy your application in different stages (dev, test, production) and environments for different customers. We open sourced the tropo library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tropo/) to create Azure Resource Templates from python.\nAzure SDK for Python (http://azure-sdk-for-python.readthedocs.io) for a low level access to manage resources in the Azure Cloud.\nAn Azure Ansible Module (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/guide_azure.html) based on the Azure SDK to automate software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment in a single environment.\n\n\nEach of the alternatives has different strengths and drawbacks. Presenting our learnings from migrating our infrastructure into the Azrue Cloud will help to avoid common pitfalls and show deployment patterns that will ease the live of devops.\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
