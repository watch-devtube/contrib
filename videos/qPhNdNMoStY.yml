description: "Many applications face the problem of communicating to external processes via stateful connections, for instance JDBC connections to databases, or SSH connections to a network server. Traditional manual connection handling a la JDBC places all the management burden on the client code, and is error prone.\n\nFor a recent project we designed -- with prudent use of the Reader, Free and IO monads -- a superior API that prevents misuse. This talk explores the evolution of this API and the challenges it presented and solved.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference and YOW!
