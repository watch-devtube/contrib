This talk presents some trends in parallel patterns for CPU/GPU architectures to enable software and hardware virtualization. It will discuss some initial results and the plans in ParaPhrase,  a novel 36-month €3.5 million European research project to develop a new structured pattern-based framework in Erlang and C/C++ for heterogeneous parallel architectures.\_\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory \_https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\_\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory \_http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
