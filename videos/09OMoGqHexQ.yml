description: "Can we land a SpaceX Falcon Heavy Rocket in simulation using machine learning? Yes! Reinforcement learning is a technique that lets an agent learn how best to act in an environment using rewards as its signal. OpenAI released a library called Gym that lets us train AI agents really easily. We'll use a combination of the Tensorflow and gym libraries to build an RL agent capable of landing a rocket perfectly. The specific technique we're using is called proximal policy optimization, this is an actor-critic algorithm that is really popular. Lets get started! \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Landing-a-SpaceX-Falcon-Heavy-Rocket\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
