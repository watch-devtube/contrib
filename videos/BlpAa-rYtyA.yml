description: "Speaker: Ehtisham Siddiqui\n\nThe concept of security starts from you – the human and the human mind. Securing web applications in general and WordPress, in particular, is not merely achieved by installing a plugin/software and letting it do the job for you. It’s a process, which I’ll divide into three categories, starting from yourself, the devices you use to WordPress itself and the infrastructure/host you’re using. Incorporating them would protect you against the majority of the attacks, making it very hard if not impossible to be hacked. We’ll also talk about what XSS, SQL Injection, and other common vulnerabilities are. These common vulnerabilities on the web today are described in the OWASP top 10 lists.\n\nEvent Page: https://2017.singapore.wordcamp.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/crur/"
