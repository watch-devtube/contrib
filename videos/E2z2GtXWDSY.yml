description: "PyData London Meetup #46\nTuesday, July 3, 2018\n\nDigital image processing may be considered as a set of algorithmic tools to derive information from digital images using a computer's processing power. It is an extension of signal processing where the signal is generally a sequence of numbers that represent samples of a continuous variable in a domain such as time, space or frequency (e.g. econometrics, seismology, audio & speech recognition). An image is typically represented with two-dimensional pixels, which is essentially a matrix or array of values indicating brightness. For a series of images we can consider the signal as three-dimensional, with the third dimension being time in the case of video frames. Applications are numerous: for example in computer & machine vision such as industry robots and autonomous cars; medical imaging such as ultrasound and MRI; and astronomy to study satellite and telescope data. Indeed many people will have some familiarity with its application in software like Photoshop and in the facial recognition and image filters of social media like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Here at Royal Mail an optical character recognition system is relied upon to read the addresses on the vast amount of mail items passing through our network.\n\nIn this talk I will give an introduction to the field of image processing and demonstrate some example applications, drawing upon my experiences in employing such techniques during my academic and data science projects to date. This should be interesting and useful to any researcher, data scientist or developer who has had limited exposure to signal or image processing techniques, especially if they would like to pursue further learning in the fields of computer and machine vision.\n\nSponsored & Hosted by Man AHL\n\n****\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
