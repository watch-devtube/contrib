description: "NoSQL is making inroads everywhere we look these days, but for those of us who have spent years in Java EE, that transition can feel daunting. This presentation begins with a basic introduction to MongoDB and how data is organized. It covers several options for getting data in and out of MongoDB and then walks through an example JPA application to show how it looks with different mapping options in MongoDB. It also explores how MongoDB’s paradigm can affect not only your object model but how you interact with the data as well.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJustin Lee\nJustin has been a Java developer since 1996.
