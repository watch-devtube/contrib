NOT to be super 10x or anything - just to feel good and function well professionally.”\n\nFull threads here: \n? https://twitter.com/mpjme/status/855691565460848640\n? https://mastodon.cloud/@mpj/2592100\n\nI got almost a hundred replies, and wen’t through them and categorized them to see if any pattern stood out. There were suprisingly few mentions of specific technical skills, almost none at all, which made me very happy, because it shows that the industry, or at least my audience, understands that technical skillset are a symptom other habits, rather than something that arises in isolation.\n\nStuff mentioned in the video:\n\n?  Grit - TED talk by Angela Duckworth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H14bBuluwB8\n?  Questions and Answers last week: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOf838UlTPU\n\n?
