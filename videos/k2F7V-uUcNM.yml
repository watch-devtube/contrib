description: "Most people prefer fast to slow. As Steve Souder points out, when we're talking about the web, this is even more true. Whether it's browser load times, or the speed of the devices we use, most people would rather use something that renders quickly.\n\nIn this keynote presentation for HTML5DevConf, Steve asks, is the web any faster now than when we started? Steve looks at trends in web performance and comes up with some best practices for the faster web page of tomorrow.\n\n**Follow along with Steve's slides, and check out more HTML5 goodies at our site!: http://mrkn.co/w1k5z"
