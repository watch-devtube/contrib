title: 'DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Continuous Delivery with Drupal'
recordingDate: 1462905911
description: "Continuous Delivery (CD) you've heard about it used on big fancy sites, but how can you implement it yourself? The critical thing in continuous delivery is that the main branch is in a deployable state at all times enabling regular releases. At DrupalCon Barcelona Dries talked about how projects, including Drupal core, might be able to achieve this noble goal. Implementing CD in Drupal 7 can be tricky but it can also be insanely powerful.\n\nIn this session we will explore some of the benefits and advantages you get from implementing CD, along with sample workflows and tools, such as Git, Jenkins, and the Drupal 7 Features and Strongarm modules and Drupal 8 Configuration Management. As well as various testing and code quality tools, such as Behat, PHP CodeSniffer, etc.\n\nAfter working for the past several years on this problem I came to the conclusion that none of the existing tools were giving my team quite what we needed and so we worked to develop and open source the solution that we wanted for Continuous Delivery for Drupal (and similar web apps). In this session I'll also speak a bit about Probo.CI and how you can use either the hosted or open source version to get up and running eadily and to really up your CD game."
