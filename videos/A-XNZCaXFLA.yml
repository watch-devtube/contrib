description: "Pauly Comtois, VP of DevOps, Hearst Business Media\n\nDevOps is focused on bringing people together through collaboration, honesty and transparency. People are at the heart of this transformative culture and finding ways to bring them together is key to DevOps success.\n\nEnterprises can sprawl across many different verticals, with unique challenges such as compliance, seasonal demand and sudden market shifts. Under these challenges however are some commonalities that enable the creation of a broader community which can unify them.\n\nI will share my experiences with helping to build DevOps cultures and principles in ten business units and how building a broader community helped to bring them together. Looking at culture, process and tools I will share the approaches that enabled higher levels of engagement and support for all involved."
