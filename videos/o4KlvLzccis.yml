description: "In this contest, languages that run on the JVM, represented by their gurus, battle for bragging rights as the most popular language by showing off their shiny new features. Adding a twist to the format in which the audience members will pick this year’s winner(s): they will also vote down a language not to return in 2014. Returning from 2012 are language gurus representing Clojure, Groovy, JRuby, and Scala. Java is also included. Attend this fun-filled and technically invigorating session to judge which scripting language best meets your needs. You’ll also be able to compare the respective languages and spark some thought-provoking discussions with the panelists that will be beneficial to the entire Java community.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJames Laskey\nundefined\nView more trainings by James Laskey at https://www.parleys.com/author/james-laskey\n\nGuillaume Laforge\nGuillaume Laforge is the Groovy Project Manager, and Spec Lead of JSR-241, the Java Specification Request standardizing the Groovy dynamic language in the Java Community Process.
