title: 'How FINN.no went from being search engine hostile to be a little bit friendly - Henning Spjelkavik'
recordingDate: 1535448338
description: "FINN.no is well known brand in Norway, and that's why search engines hasn't been a topic high on the agenda. Over time this lack of interest added up, so that by 2017 we had 30 million irrelevant pages indexed, there were no landing page for important categories - or they might have been blocked and was unaccessible from a search engine.\nThis talk is a combination of the basics a web developer should know about search engine friendliness, and the story about how we improved this aspect of FINN.no."
