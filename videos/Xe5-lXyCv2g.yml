recordingDate: 1499244234
description: "The web is becoming more and more powerful everyday, especially with the launch of Progressive Web Apps. PWAs are experiences that combine the best of the web and the best of apps. You can now build web apps that run from your home screen, receive push notifications & work offline.\n\nWe will start by introducing Progressive Web Apps by explaining what are the main concepts behind it (such as Web App Manifest & Service Worker).\n\nWe will cover in depth how we can write service worker code to control the network and create resilient experiences.\n\nAfter introducing PWAs, we will explore relevant best practices.\n\nLast but not least, we will explore some modern Web APIs that will make building PWAs a much more robust experience."
