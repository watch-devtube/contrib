description: "► Check out https://gorails.com for Pro episodes and more!\n► Ruby on Rails hosting with Hatchbox.io! https://hatchbox.io\n\nLearn more about the Ruby 2.6.0 JIT here: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/12/25/ruby-2-6-0-released/\n\nThe JIT compiler is currently not good enough to improve performance for memory-intensive workloads like Rails applications. This is why it's disabled by default in Ruby 2.6's release, but it's very easy to turn on and test out. \n\nMake sure you run benchmarks before using the JIT in production!"
