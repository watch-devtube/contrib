description: "Do you lie awake at night wondering why you can’t count up past 9 quadrillion in JavaScript? Have you ever been troubled by numbers that don’t add up correctly or do what you expect (looking at you, 0.1 + 0.2)?\nJavaScript’s numbers can behave a little… unexpectedly at times, and cause bugs that can have you scratching your head for hours on end. From incorrect arithmetic to Beyoncé showing up on your page twice as often as you expect, in this talk we’ll take a look at the quirks that come from numbers in JavaScript & the strange issues they can cause.\n\nMeggan is a Software Engineer at Jaxsta, a music startup dedicated to providing credit where credit is due. At Jaxsta, she writes code for the front-end platform, tinkers with databases & derails conversations with random music trivia (mostly about Beyoncé). When she's not coding you can find her rock climbing, swimming with sharks, or doing something else that makes her parents nervous.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - LASALLE College of the Arts, Singapore - 16 June 2019\n\nSource: https://2019.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
