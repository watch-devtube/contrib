description: "Frank Munz, Director, munz & more\n\nEdelweiss Kammermann, CMS BI Manager, ITConvergence\n\nThis session is based on a full-day big data workshop delivered to 40 database professionals at the German User Group (DOAG) conference in 2016, garnering fantastic feedback (www.munzandmore.com/2016/ora/big-data-cloudera-oracle-training-feedback-doag). There are zillions of open source big data projects these days. In the session, you will learn about the core principles of four key technologies that are most often used in projects: Hadoop, Spark, Hive, and Kafka. The presentation first explains the fundamentals of those four big data technologies. Then you will see how to take the first easy steps into the big data world yourself, with Oracle Big Data Cloud Service and Oracle Event Hub Cloud Service live demos."
