title: 'Skein: a simpler way to deploy applications on Hadoop Clusters - Jim Crist'
language: English
recordingDate: 1546569871
description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nApache YARN is the resource manager native to Hadoop. Its JVM-only nature, complicated security model, and myriads of options have historically made it difficult to deploy non-java applications on it. In this talk we present Skein, a tool & library written to ease Python deployment on YARN, as well as some of the issues (and solutions!) we encountered while developing and testing this tool.\n\nSlides - http://jcrist.github.io/talks/skein_talk/slides.html#/\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
