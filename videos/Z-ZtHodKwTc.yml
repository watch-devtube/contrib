description: "Implementing a programming language atop an existing platform brings up some curious integration challenges with said platform. In the process of designing Nashorn’s Java platform integration features, the designers had to figure out lots of things: How can you subclass Java classes in script? What interfaces should script objects expose to Java: map, list, both, none? What consequences do the different decisions bring? How to reconcile differences in array representation? What’s a correct JSON representation of a POJO? (Is this a trick question?) Should Java packages exist as objects? (Trick question again?) How much plumbing should we hide as a convenience to developers, and what should remain exposed lest they stumble across it in the dark? All is revealed in this session.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAttila Szegedi\nundefined\nView more trainings by Attila Szegedi at https://www.parleys.com/author/attila-szegedi\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
