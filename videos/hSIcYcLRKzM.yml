description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015\nPresenters: Baruch Sadogursky & Phil Webb\nCore Spring Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/behind-the-oss-curtain-how-we-manage-spring\n\nHow is the open source you use published actually managed? What techniques and tools do successful open source projects use? How are open source projects able to lever the community that they build? This talk will take you behind the scenes of the Spring Framework to show you how we manage code, issues and releases. We'll talk about the tools that we use, how we keep code clean and consistent, and how we use Artifactory/Bintray to manage the bits."
