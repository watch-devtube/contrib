description: "Typography in digital experiences is unavoidable and for years it was a fight we mostly lost. Today, however, technology is on our side!\nHigh resolution screens, an expanding library of open fonts and new flexibility in nearly every UI technology have made digital typography more fun and more interesting than ever. We'll cover all aspects of working with digital type: everything from choosing typefaces to licensing, rendering and a system for layout and sizing. This is a talk for everyone from type nerds (come for the good feels) or regular nerds (learn enough to impress your nerd friends). We should all love typography. Come find out why!"
