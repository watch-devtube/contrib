title: 'Fluent 2012: Ben Galbraith & Dion Almaer, "Web vs. Apps"'
recordingDate: 1339023020
description: "Apple's iPhone SDK has been the largest disruption to software development since the Web, sparking the creation in a few short years of the largest medium for consumer engagement in the world, eclipsing the Web, movies, and even television. While some prophesy that in the coming years mobile apps will be replaced by the web, in today's reality a number of high profile start-ups are bypassing the web entirely to reach their audience exclusively via apps. Join Ben and Dion as they discuss the role of the web in the mobile present and explore developer issues as we head into the post-PC era.\n\nBen Galbraith\n\nWalmart.com\n\nBen Galbraith, together with his long-time friend Dion Almaer, forms one-half of the dynamic \"Ben and Dion\" duo that founded Ajaxian.com, headed Developer Tools at Mozilla, ran Developer Relations at Palm and is now running mobile architecture and engineering at Walmart.com after being acquired along with their start-up team in early 2011. Ben's been writing code since he was six and starting businesses since he was ten; he's written books, given hundreds of award-winning presentations world-wide, produced a few technical conferences, sold three companies, and has held CEO, CIO, CTO, and Software Architect positions in the medical, publishing, media, consumer electronics, advertising, software and internet industries. He lives in Palo Alto with his wife and six children.\n\nDion Almaer\n\nWalmart.com\n\nDion Almaer is a technologist who loves to code and build. He and his long time partner-in-crime Ben Galbraith recently brought their team to Walmart to power the mobile engineering efforts. He enjoys sharing his passion for software production across various communities, including a new property called FunctionSource.com.\n\nDion has been writing Web applications since it took over from Gopher. He has been fortunate enough to speak around the world, has published many articles, a book, and of course covers life the universe and everything on his blog.\n\nHe has been called a human aggregator, and you can see that in full force if you follow him on Twitter."
