description: "Speaker: Miguel Gallardo, Propoint\n\nFrameworks are very helpful to solve common problems when developing an application. But what happens if we have to move to a new version or another framework? In this talk I will show how my company tries to keep independent of any framework, decoupling our business logic from symfony.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nI have more than 13 years working on the design and development end to end of sites, application and systems, working for a company or for his own. Always learning to improve my skills and to acquire new technologies. I have become a polyglot developer who works on multiple programming languages applying best practices and using agile methodologies; with experience in tech leadership roles.\n\nEvent Page: https://2018.phpconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/lcA1/"
