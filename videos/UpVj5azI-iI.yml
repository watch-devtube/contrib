description: "CSSconf.eu - http://cssconf.eu - Berlin, September 13, 2013\n\nSlides: tba\n\nTalk description: \"CSS2, CSS3, CSS...4? This talk will explore a little bit of CSS past and present, disambiguate some version terminology (levels? modules?), and then dive into potential CSS future. We'll examine what the Level 4 specifications bring to the table and what those new features could mean for the future of web development. Selectors, media queries, backgrounds, images, and text all have fresh recommendations to improve the web ecosystem. We'll explore a little of each so you can be thinking ahead. The current state of polyfills and shims will be discussed so that the brave can forge ahead. We will also touch upon how a specification eventually becomes a feature so that you can understand the development of CSS, as well as where to go to participate in the discussions shaping the web of the future.\"\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
