description: "Unleash the Multi-Cloud with BOSH - Jatin Naik, Pivotal\n\nCloud operators want to be able to run and manage systems on a variety of cloud providers. Today Cloud Foundry’s BOSH only supports a single cloud provider for a given installation.\n\nIntroducing the BOSH meta CPI concept project which deploys multiple CPIs and allows a CPI to be chosen while deploying, giving operators the power to decide which IaaS is used for certain instance types and thus the ability to create a multi-cloud BOSH deployments. Uses cases for the meta CPI include deploying systems across multiple clouds, scaling from a private to a public cloud, running services on a particular IaaS that provides specialised hardware and executing errands in Garden containers.\n\nUnderstand how to manage multi cloud deployments using a single BOSH installation and learn about the latency and network issues that arise.\n\nAbout Jatin Naik\nSoftware Engineer at Pivotal, on Cloud Foundry."
