title: 'Automating experiments with Kotlin DSL (Aleksandr Tarasov, Russia) [RU]'
language: Russian
recordingDate: 1528194694
description: 'In a large project, you can not just take it and make it available to all customers. Therefore, experiments are conducted that require manual changes that lead to time costs and sometimes errors. To remove these factors, Odnoklassniki decided to automate the preparation and launch of experiments. In the report, Aleksandr Tarasov will tell you why Kotlin was chosen for this, rather than the classic configuration management tools (such as Ansible), why a good DSL and toolkit are critical to this task. Make a deep dive into Kotlin Script feature and overcome problems that we’ve solved in order for everything to work as originally conceived.'
