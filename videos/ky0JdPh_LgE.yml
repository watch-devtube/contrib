description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nMetaprogramming isn’t always easy to apprehend and the purpose of this talk is to show through the resolution of two real life problems where it can be applied to increase productivity and reliability. The first case study will exhibit how we can use TMP to allocate at compile time the required memory for serializing simple structures such as a pair of integers. The second case study will be about generating a memory layout for array of structures perfectly fit for the targeted platform. The examples are based on the Brigand TMP library and will be an opportunity to see how MP constructs such as collection of types and compile time algorithms are made and when they should be used. The talk might contain obscure jokes related to pastries naming.\n— \nEdouard Alligand\nquasardb\nCEO\nParis, France\nEdouard has more than thirteen years of professional experience in software engineering. After years hacking the kernel of various operating systems, Edouard founded Bureau 14, the home of the hyperscalable database quasardb. Combining an excellent knowledge of low level programming with a perverse love for template meta-programming, Edouard likes to come up with uncompromising solutions to seemingly impossible problems. He lives in Paris, France.\n\nJoel Falcou\nCTO, NUMSCALE\nJoel Falcou is NumScale CTO. NumScale mission is to assist businesses in the exploration and subsequently the mastery of high-performance computing systems. | | He is also an assistant professor at the University Paris-Sud and researcher at the Laboratoire de Recherche d’Informatique in Orsay, France.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
