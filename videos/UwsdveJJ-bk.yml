description: "Kubo - Your Gateway Drug to Cloud-Native - Cornelia Davis, Pivotal\n\nYou’re at the Cloud Foundry Summit, which means you are by definition a cloud-native enthusiast. There’s no question that building apps in this architectural style will produce resilient, scalable software in an agile manner, and allow you to operate it far more efficiently than you’ve been able to in the past. But you’ve also got a whole lot of software in your company’s portfolio that isn’t there yet. Do you have to resign yourself to the pains of managing those applications the old way until you can finally refactor them to be cloud-native? Kubo to the rescue.\n\nYou can run legacy applications on Kubo without significant refactoring – pure and simple. As an added bonus, it allows you to satisfy the CIO mandate of running containers (check). But it’s far more than that – running those workloads on Kubo offers advantages over running them on traditional virtualized infrastructure. This session covers those advantages –resource consolidation, health management, multi-cloud and more. It will also present the abstractions in Kubernetes, things like pods and stateful sets, that support running legacy workloads in the cloud environments that are far more distributed and changing than they have been in the past. It’s a first step to cloud-native.\n\nAbout Cornelia Davis\nCornelia Davis is Sr. Director of Technology at Pivotal, where she works on the technology strategy for both Pivotal and for Pivotal customers. Through engagement across Pivotal’s broad customer base, Cornelia develops core cloud platform strategies that drive significant change in enterprise organizations, and influence the Pivotal Cloud Foundry evolution. Currently she is working on ways to bring the various cloud-computing models of Infrastructure as a Service, Application as a Service, Container as a Service and Function as a Service together into a comprehensive offering that allows IT organizations to function at the highest levels. She is the author of the book “Cloud Native: Designing Change-tolerant Software” by Manning Publications (https://www.manning.com/books/cloud-native). \n\nAn industry veteran with almost three decades of experience in image processing, scientific visualization, distributed systems and web application architectures, and cloud-native platforms, Cornelia holds the B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from California State University, Northridge and further studied theory of computing and programming languages at Indiana University.\n\nWhen not doing those things you can find her on the yoga mat or in the kitchen."
