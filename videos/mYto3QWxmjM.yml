description: "Our objective is to show you how easy and rewarding it is to get involved with building the IoT, using some practical examples of technology at each end of the IoT spectrum:\n\n* A low-power mesh network radio module that support IPv6 / 6LoWPAN and runs the Contiki open-source operating system.\n* An autonomous flying robot that can find a lost bushwalker and drop a bottle of water to them.\n\nUsing these pieces of the IoT we will show some examples and demonstrations of what can be done by applying and extending the technical skills you already have, by leveraging the very approachable open source hardware and software that's becoming available now. We'll include some pointers for what technologies to use and how to get started.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
