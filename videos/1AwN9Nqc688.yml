description: "Docker & Buildpacks: One App, Two Options for Deploying to Cloud Foundry - Jen Spinney, HPE & James Myers, Pivotal\n\nNow that Cloud Foundry natively supports pushing Docker containers in addition to the traditional approach of constructing an app from a buildpack, end-users have a choice about which strategy to use. In this talk, we’ll walk through pushing the same sample app to Cloud Foundry using both the buildpack and Docker container techniques. \n\nWe’ll discuss the pros and cons of both approaches, and at the end of the talk, attendees will have a better sense of the ‘hows’ and the ‘whys’ of the buildpack and Docker application lifecycles in Cloud Foundry.\n\nAbout James Myers\nJames Myers is a software engineer for Pivotal Software and a core contributor to the Cloud Foundry project. James is currently the anchor of the Diego team and has worked on Cloud Foundry for two years. He has presented previously at the 2015 and 2016 North American CF Summits.\n\nAbout Jen Spinney\nJen Spinney is a software engineer at HP Enterprise, where she works as a core contributor on the CF Diego team. Prior to HPE, she worked at Microsoft on the OData team where she developed a passion for open source and cross-company software development. She pairs remotely from the HPE office in Seattle, WA."
