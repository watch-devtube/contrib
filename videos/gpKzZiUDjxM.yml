description: "(** www.edureka.co/graphical-modelling-course **)\nThis Edureka \"Graphical Models\" video answers the question \"Why do we need Probabilistic Graphical Models?\" and how are they compare to Neural Networks. It takes you through the basics of PGMs and gives real-world examples of its applications.\n\n[01:02] Why do you need PGMs?\n[01:40] What is a PGM?\n[09:59] Bayesian Networks\n[21:22] Markov Random Fields\n[23:43] Use Cases\n[25:02] Bayesian Networks & Markov Random Fields\n[28:21] PGMs & Neural Networks\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel to get video updates.

You'll see more often than not, that many machine learning models are defined with graphical models. That make it an essential aspect in your learning path towards Data Science.\n\nGot a question on the topic?
