description: "Smiles as a Service: A Play in Three Acts\n\nSociologists have been researching Emotional Labor since the 1970s, but it has only recently broken into the public’s consciousness. As more people transition into service-oriented jobs, we inevitably perform more and more Emotional Labor. But what exactly is Emotional Labor? Who performs it? And how can individuals, organizations, and companies do better to support people who perform Emotional Labor.\n\nSpeaker: Christopher Hendrix\n\nChris Hendrix is a senior software engineer and consultant at Pivotal. He believes in a multi-disciplinary approach to software development and education: blending a degree in Materials Science, a self-taught background in Computer Science, and a passion for design.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/materialdesignr"
