description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nFebruary 24, 2010\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Dino Farinacci.\r\n\r\nNow that Part 1 and Part 2 sessions gave you the foundation of the technology, we will take a deep-dive of the various use-cases LISP provides. From low opex multi-homing to using provider independent addresses to Data Center to Mobility applications, we will show how one architectural solution can solve so many critical problems we have today in networking. We will show how LISP can be deployed practically and incrementally. We will give an update on the 3rd generation LISP network we have deployed to test the LISP protocols. This network has over 50 boxes from 4 distinct product sets across 10 countries. We will share with you lessons learned and where we are going forward.\r\n\r\nDino Farinacci:\r\nDino originally joined Cisco in spring of 1991 and was one of the first two Cisco Fellows. He has built routers for 27 years. Dino currently works in the Data Center Business Unit at cisco where his focus is on building a next-generation platform and operating system for Enterprise and Data Center environments. This platform is the Nexus 7000 running NX-OS which shipped in April of 2008. His expertise specializes in routing protocols where he has intimate knowledge and implementation experience with IS-IS, EIGRP, OSPF, BGP, IGMP, PIM, and MSDP, as well as IPv6 and MPLS protocols.\r\n\r\nHe is an advocate for modular operating systems. Dino also has been a member of the IETF for 19 years making many contributions over this period of time. Dino has worked for Cisco since early 1991 but was away for 5 years at Procket Networks where he help build the highest speed and most dense router (still to date) in a half rack chassis which ran a fully modular operating system. He has been back at cisco for 5 years where he is currently working on new multicast routing technology such as Multicast Fast-Reroute, AMT, Multicast Virtualization, and layer-2 multicast for Data-Center Ethernet. Dino invented OTV with his routing colleagues in DCBU and wrote the initial implementation on NX-OS.\r\n\r\nDino is not just a multicast bigot but works on many other protocol and OS initiatives. For example, recently he is prototyping an idea called LISP to separate an IP address into an ID and Locator to allow the Internet to scale better. LISP has been accepted as a working group of the IETF where Dino participates intimately authoring 7 Internet Drafts."
