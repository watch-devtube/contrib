description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nWe are all aware that we should know the STL algorithms. Including them in our designs allows us to make our code more expressive and more robust. And sometimes, in a spectacular way. \n\nBut do you know your STL algorithms? \n\nIn this presentation, you’ll see the 105 algorithms that the STL currently has, including those added in C++11 and C++17. But more than just a listing, the point of this presentation is to highlight the different groups of algorithms, the patterns they form in the STL, and how the algorithms relate together. And all this in an entertaining way. \n\nThis kind of big picture is the best way I know to actually remember them all, and constitute a toolbox chock-full of ways to make our code more expressive and more robust.\n— \n\nJonathan Boccara, Murex\n\nJonathan Boccara is a Principal Engineering Lead at Murex where he works on large codebases in C++.\nHis primary focus is searching how to make code more expressive. He has dedicated his blog, Fluent C++, to writing expressive code in C++. \nHe also gives internal trainings on C++ every day, in the short format called \"Dailies\".\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
