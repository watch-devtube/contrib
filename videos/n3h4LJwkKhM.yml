description: "With microservices, polyglot and devops on the rise, where are we at with testing? Does it bring more complexity and makes our testing effort harder or in maybe in contrary it actually helps us write better tests easier?\n\nIn this session we will be exploring not only how we can do our testing in this new world, but also how the new world can help us test better.\n\nWe will take a close look at topics varying from NodeJS, DynJS, VertX, Ceylon or Ruby orchestrated microservices through system scale testing with different configurations to database migration and regression testing. All are within a reach."
