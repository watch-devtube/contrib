title: '"Are DDoS attacks a threat to the decentralised internet?" by Marek Majkowski'

recordingDate: 1474223057
description: "DDoS attacks often grab the headlines when they take down an important website. Sadly, DDoS experts usually keep the attack information to themselves. All the DDoS mitigation resources are centralized in a hands of a few large DDoS mitigation vendors. Without the details internet operators are unable to distinguish a real danger from an empty threat.\n\nAt CloudFlare we deal with DDoS attacks every day and over the years we've gained a lot of experience. While some of our DDoS defenses require significant investment - e.g. buying more network capacity - many mitigations can be implemented in software.\n\nIn this talk we'll discuss what we learned about the L3 (Layer 3 OSI stack) IP spoofing.\n\nWe'll explain why L3 attacks are even possible in today's internet, what a direct L3 attack may look like and how it is different from a reflected attack. We'll describe our attempts to trace IP spoofing and why the attribution is so hard.\n\nOur architecture allows us to perform attack mitigations in software. We'll explain a couple of effective L3 mitigations techniques we've learned over the years.\n\nWhile L3 attacks are a real danger to the internet operators, they don't need to be. With a bit of cooperation and couple of technical tricks maybe we can finally save the internet and fix the IP spoofing problem for all."
