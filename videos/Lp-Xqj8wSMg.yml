title: 'The Origin of Opera and the Future of Programming  by Jessica Kerr'
recordingDate: 1534168057
description: "There's a story to tell, about musicians, artists, philosophers, scientists, and then programmers.\n\nThere's a truth inside it that leads to a new view of work, that sees beauty in the painful complexity that is software development.\n\nStarting from The Journal of the History of Ideas, Jessica traces the concept of an “invisible college” through music and art and science to programming. She finds the dark truth behind the 10x developer, a real definition of “Senior Developer” and a new name for our work and our teams.\n\nJessica is a programmer across languages and speaker across continents. Six years ago she started a journey from Java work to speaking about Android, F#, and git; through Scala and Clojure and going remote; property tests, concurrency, keynoting ElixirConf; then Ruby for infrastructure with Elm for fun; to Atomist, where she writes TypeScript that automates development tasks in any language. It’s a journey from programs to distributed systems to symmathesy, a human + software system based on mutual learning. Meanwhile, in real life, Jessica keeps two children alive and loved and silly."
