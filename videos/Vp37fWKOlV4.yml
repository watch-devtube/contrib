description: "As superfluous as something like animation may initially seem, you can tell a lot about framework by the way that it handles the concept of time. Idiosyncrasies and race conditions in rendering reveal themselves, pauses in DOM and virtual DOM diffing can be exposed. This is one of the ways Vue shows itself to be uniquely capable and elegant.\n\nIn this session, we'll cover the basics of working with Vue, how to use the component and some of its offerings to create fluid effects in the browser. We'll move on to watchers, the reactivity system, and transitioning state. Finally, we'll talk about lifecycle methods, SVG, and pushing our animations to the next level.\n\nEVENT: SmashConf Barcelona 2017 (https://www.smashingmagazine.com/)\n\nSPEAKER: Sarah Drasner\n\nPERMISSIONS: Coding Tech received permissions to republish this video from the conference organizer."
