description: "Requirements in agile development are much more than just a prioritized list of user stories. Release planning can be as important as the documentation of implemented business rule details.\nThis talk introduces three popular techniques for discovering user needs on different goal levels, and how they fit together: Impact Mapping for strategic release planning, Story Mapping for designing and optimizing the scope of a release and Specification-By-Example for establishing a shared understanding about domain details and as an enabler for automated, business readable acceptance tests.\nYou will leave this session with an overview about these three techniques, and how you can combine them in your daily work."
