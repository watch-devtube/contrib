title: 'Velocity 2012: Arvind Jain & Dominic Hamon, "Predicting User Activity to Make the Web Fast"'
recordingDate: 1340769018
description: "In this talk, we will talk about prerendering, a feature that Chrome uses to start loading a web page before the user actually navigates to it to make it feel instant. We will share statistics on how much speed up websites around the world have experienced by using this feature. Then we'll dig deep into how we use prerendering to make navigations from Chrome Omnibox faster. Specifically we will discuss how we build a model to predict user navigations, and how much time are we able to save our users using prerendering in Omnibox.\n\nArvind Jain\n\nGoogle\n\nArvind is a Director of Engineering at Google and works on making Google and the Internet fast.
