description: "Drones are being used in real world applications around the world! They can help detect anomalies in crop yields, provide companies with physical assets a real-time continuous data stream, and help secure locations by giving teams an aerial view. We'll learn how a dron can learn to navigate a novel, complex environment using an advanced reinforcement learning technique called Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients. Its a mixture of policy gradients and actor critic, I'll go through the dependencies before explaining the real algorithm.
