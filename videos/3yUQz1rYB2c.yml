title: 'Building a dynamic SPA website with Angular | Filip Bruun Bech-Larsen'
language: English
recordingDate: 1511260104
description: "So.. we really wanna use the new shiny angular, we want to build a Single-Page-Application so we can animate page-transitions, but we still want the CMS to control routes and templates (we have many and they change all the time). We also want the CMS-editor to be in control of the pages content and render unknown rows of dynamic content. How can we remain this level of flexibility while compiling our templates Ahead-Of-Time (AOT). In this walk we will follow the thought- and working process, trial and errors and end up with a working solution. It will be lots of options with pros/cons, some live-coding, tradeoffs and will end up with a GitHub repository for everyone to go home and clone.\n\nSlides: \nhttps://www.slideshare.net/FilipBruunBechLarsen/building-a-dynamic-spa-website-with-angular\n\nSpeaker:\nFilip is a frontend developer from Denmark, focusing on delivering great user-experiences to the end-user – often using Angular.
