title: 'RailsConf Workshop on using Cloud Foundry'
language: English
recordingDate: 1305808015
description: "This screencast is based on a technical workshop from the 2011 RailsConf (http://en.oreilly.com/rails2011/public/schedule/detail/20419). It shows developers how to use Cloud Foundry, the first open Platform-as-a-Service initiated by VMware. We take you through creating a Sinatra application using sample code from here http://bit.ly/cf_labs . Once the Sinatra application (which leverages Twitter) is working, we then add Redis (http://redis.io) to your application. Finally, we show you how to scale your application instances up and then back down.\n\nPlease note that if you are using this code and get an Undetermined error, it is likely due to rate limiting from Twitter. If this happens, try your code again a while later as the rate limiting on Twitter is hourly-usage based."
