title: 'Can Third Party Scripts Take Down Your Entire Site - O''Reilly Webcast'
recordingDate: 1421935205
description: "Originally aired June 4, 2014.  Do you know how many third-party scripts your pages are currently running? And do you know how many of those scripts are affecting your site's performance — either by slowing down page rendering or by potentially blocking the entire page?\n\nIf you don't know the answer to these questions, you're not alone. The rampant proliferation of third-party scripts makes them difficult to manage and control. In this webcast led by Tammy Everts, you'll walk through a process for testing the scripts on your pages to see which ones represent a SPOF. We'll also review an 11-step plan for bullet-proofing your site against third-party failure.\n\nAbout Tammy Everts\n\nPerformance evangelist at Radware. I inhale data. I exhale reports, blog posts, and random tweets. \n\n - Don't miss an upload! Subscribe! http://goo.gl/szEauh - \nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media.
