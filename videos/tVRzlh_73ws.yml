description: "Spring I/O 2018 - Barcelona, 24-25 May\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/bslota/springio-2018-dynamic-configuration-management-in-microservice-architecture-with-spring-cloud\n\nGitHub repos: \nhttps://github.com/bslota/cloud-config\nhttps://github.com/bslota/config-repository\n\nThese days it seems to be obvious for us to keep the configuration separately from code, but sometimes having properties/yml files with our codebase is not enough. During this presentation I will focus on configuration issues in microservice environment. Don’t worry - there won’t be too much slides - I will do some live-coding and show you how can we improve configuration management with Spring Cloud and Apache Kafka, and how easy it is to reconfigure our application live without rebuilding or rebooting it."
