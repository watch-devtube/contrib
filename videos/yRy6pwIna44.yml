description: "The popularity of containers has driven the need for distributed systems that can securely provision and manage resources, place workloads, and adapt in the presence of failures.\n\nIn this talk, we will go over how Docker has been working on multiple components to secure every part of the container platform - from an OS built with LinuxKit all the way up to container orchestration with SwarmKit - and how all of these components fit together to result in safer applications.\n\n# Riyaz Faizullabhoy\nRiyaz is a security engineer at Docker, where he maintains LinuxKit and Notary. Previously, Riyaz researched systems security and malware at UC Berkeley. Riyaz has been fortunate to have presented at many venues, including LinuxCon and DockerCon."
