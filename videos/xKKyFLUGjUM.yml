You’ll see components become fully-functioning electronics on an assembly line, in an illustration of how fast and fluid the hardware process has become.\n\nAlike Bands connect people with common interests. Wear them at Solid to meet other members of the hardware and IoT community, and to see how social wearables might change the way we interact.\n\nThe IoT is creating a perfect storm of innovation and opportunity.\nBook your tickets today! https://en.oreilly.com/internet-of-things-2015/public/register\n\nHardware, software, sensors, and physical things are coming together in uncharted waters.
