description: "What was the first undecidable problem? Professor Brailsford takes us on a computerphile tangent & gives us his angle on a pre-computer example of undecidability.\n\nNote from Professor Brailsford: a couple of corrections for this film:\n1/ \"... early 18th Century\" for Gauss should be \" ... early 19th century\" \n2/ \"... 100 years ago\" for Newton should be \"... 100 years before Gauss\n\n3/ The Greek word I was struggling with was \"Boeotians\". I have now taken expert advice which tells me that the \"oe\" is pronounced \"ee\" as in \"Oedipus\". Hence a reasonable approximation to the correct pronunciation is \"Bee-oh-shuns\"\n\n4/ In my excitement to get the message across I sometimes refer, in the video, to Euclid's 5th axiom being a \"proposition\". However it is more accurately a \"postulate\" i.e. something which should be provable from the other axioms/postulates of the Euclidean system. The fact that it can't be thus proved means that the other axioms are insufficiently powerful to prove it -- hence it is \"undecidable\" within that axiom system.\"\n\nRiemann Hypothesis – Numberphile: http://youtu.be/d6c6uIyieoo \nFermat's Last Theorem – Numberphile: http://youtu.be/qiNcEguuFSA \nTuring & The Halting Problem: http://youtu.be/macM_MtS_w4 \n\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\n\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: http://bit.ly/nottscomputer\n\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.
