description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nWe are all human and we all have our sins. In our professional lives as well. Unfortunately we do not realize many of them, and even the smallest ones, can have a negative impact on what is happening in our everyday work and our teams. Committed, over and over again, they affect everything that is important in our projects both from business and technical perspective. These small bugs in our behaviour can lead to worse requirements understanding, bad decision making and decrease technical quality. During the presentation, I would like to share my observations and thoughts, which sins to avoid and what to pay attention to, not to land in the coder's hell."
