title: 'DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Lessons from WordPress Core'
recordingDate: 1463001721
description: "Drupal and WordPress started in similar places culturally and technologically. After beginning with Benevolent Dictators for Life writing PHP 4 code the projects diverged. The split is most visible in governance models and the managing of legacy code. Now that Drupal is past 8.0.0 we are closer to WordPress than many realize. We are striving for scheduled minor releases (every six months) that maintain backwards compatibility. WordPress releases feature-adding point releases every four months and has maintained backwards compatibility for years.\n\nThis presentation will cover specific lessons that we can take from WordPress including:\n\nThe release lead role (a different person setting the agenda for each point release every four months).\n\nHow new features are added to WordPress Core.\n\nManaging commit access for WordPress Core.\n\nWordPress patch-based workflow.\n\nComparison of Acquia and Automattic.\n\nCalypso, an alternate administrative interface, written in JavaScript that relies on a REST API.\n\nUser trust"
