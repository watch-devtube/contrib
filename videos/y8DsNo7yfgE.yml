description: "by Fabien Chouteau\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.126/riscvadaspark.webm\n\n\nIn this talk I want to open a window into the wonderful world of \"alternative\"\nprogramming languages for RISC-V. What can you get by looking beyond C/C++. \n\nSo I will start with a quick introduction to the Ada and SPARK languages, the\nbenefits, the hurdles. I will also present an overview of the applications and\ndomains where they shine, when failure is not an option. \n\nI will then do a short getting started session and provide all the details for\nyou to start RISC-V programming with Ada/SPARK on different platforms (QEMU,\nHiFive1, FPGAs with PicoRV32). \n\nAt the end of the talk, I will give my view of the RISC-V architecture and\ncommunity from the perspective of an alternative languages developer. I will\ncover the good points, the risks, and provide some ideas on how the RISC-V can\nkeep the door open. \n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 13:30:00+01"
