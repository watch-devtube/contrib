description: "Flow Control in JavaScript is hard! Native Promises in JavaScript have helped immensely, but the syntax is still a little callback-y. With Async + Await, we can write synchronous looking code without losing any of the benefits of JavaScript's asynchronous nature.\n\nWes Bos explores how async + await works, best practices for flow control, and explores several solutions for handling errors.\n\nFilmed at https://2017.dotjs.io on December 1st in Paris.\n\nYou can follow Wes Bos on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wesbos\n\nThis talk is under the creative commons license. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.
