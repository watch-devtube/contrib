description: "by Chris Lamb\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.220/tragedy_of_the_commons_clause.webm\n\n\nIn August 2018, Redis Labs relicensed a number of AGPL-licensed Redis modules with the \"Commons Clause\" amendment on the grounds that it prevents abuse and therefore ensures the sustainability of its development. \n\nAs this renders the software no-longer free and open source, GNU/Linux distributions such as Debian and Fedora are unable to ship Redis Labs' versions of the affected modules to their users. \n\nThis talk from a long-time (2009) Redis user &amp; developer will outline the history, background &amp; response to this flavour of license, as well explain how this it at odds with communities in which they participate in and are ultimately are a short-sighted &amp; retrograde step for the companies and individuals that are advocating for them. \n\nFurthermore, this talk will ask some thought-provoking questions about how the the conversation around \"sustainability\" in open source is being co-opted by foregrounding of financial elements to the detriment of the principles &amp; people that have so clearly and demonstratively served us so well in the past four decades. \n\nRoom: UA2.220 (Guillissen)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 13:00:00+01"
