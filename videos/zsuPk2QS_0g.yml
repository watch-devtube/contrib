title: 'Ulf Wiger - Locks - Erlang-style Scalable Distributed Locking'
language: English
recordingDate: 1404120115
description: "Locking is a fundamental requirement for many applications, and - not least in database systems - distributed locking can be very difficult to make both robust and scalable.\n\nThe 'locks' project implements a powerful locking library, which manages to perform deadlock detection in an extremely scalable manner. This is done using a message-passing protocol developed by Ulf Wiger and verified by Dr. Thomas Arts. Also included is a new leader election behavior similar to gen_leader, but more dynamic, and extended to deal with split-brain issues robustly.\n\nThis presentation gives an introduction to distributed locking problems, explains the 'locks' algorithm, introduces the various locking features, and discusses how the functionality might be used.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\nThe talk aims to explain the issues of distributed locking and show how they can be tackled in proper Erlang style.\n\nTarget audience:\n\nDevelopers, system architects, people who like clever algorithms\n\n \nSlides\nAbout Ulf\n\nUlf Wiger has been programming Erlang since 1992, and was, to his knowledge, the first ever commercial Erlang customer. After 13 years at Ericsson learning how to build 5-nines telecom systems, and 3 years as CTO of Erlang Solutions, Ulf is now in the trenches for real, reinventing device programming, together with Erlang Zen master Tony Rogvall and Telematics guru Magnus Feuer, in the startup Feuerlabs."
