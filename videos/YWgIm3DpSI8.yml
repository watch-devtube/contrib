description: "Annie Hedgpeth - Cloud Automation Engineer, 10th Magnitude\n\nWith the growing demand for developers, the IT industry is tasked with bringing more workers into the field. Along with the lack of support from universities, stereotypes and ignorance are a major blocker to this initiative. I will speak about my journey into technology (from a background in film and art) by finding things that lowered the barrier to entry for me and how I attained the skills necessary to become a cloud automation engineer in 4 months. While in that job, I wanted to learn Docker, but my colleagues advised against it, as it was too advanced of a topic. Out of necessity, I learned it anyway, and I discovered that, because of the concept of inverted learning, Docker is arguably a very strong tool in lowering the barrier to entry into technology for many others."
