description: 'Android security is nowhere near where it should be. I have been able to hack and get sensitive information from a few different apps and I’m just an amateur hacker at best. It’s easy to forget mobile devices aren’t as safe as we think they are. In this session we will explore a number of ways an Android app can be exploited and methods we can use to avoid these attacks. We will finish by looking at common techniques that will help you protect sensitive information within your application by adding tampering detection and making sure every external communication request is made securely.'
