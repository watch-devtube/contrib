description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2017 #flinkforward\n\nRobert Metzger,  Engineering Lead at data Artisans\n\nLet’s be honest: Running a distributed stateful stream processor that is able to handle terabytes of state and tens of gigabytes of data per second while being highly available and correct (in an exactly-once sense) does not work without any planning, configuration and monitoring. While the Flink developer community tries to make everything as simple as possible, it is still important to be aware of all the requirements and implications In this talk, we will provide some insights into the greatest operations mysteries of Flink from a high-level perspective: - Capacity and resource planning: Understand the theoretical limits. - Memory and CPU configuration: Distribute resources according to your needs. - Setting up High Availability: Planning for failures. - Checkpointing and State Backends: Ensure correctness and fast recovery For each of the listed topics, we will introduce the concepts of Flink and provide some best practices we have learned over the past years supporting Flink users in production.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
