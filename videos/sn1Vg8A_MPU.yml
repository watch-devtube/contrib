description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nWe will discuss the currently available free static analysis software available for C++. What kinds of errors can these tools catch? What kind do they miss? Why static analysis should be a part of your normal build process.\n— \nI'm an independent contractor with 15 years of development experience. For the past 5 years I've been specializing in cross platform development, scripting of C++ libraries, and automated testing and code quality analysis. I'm the co-creator and maintainer of the embedded scripting language for C++, ChaiScript http://chaiscript.com, and author and curator of the forkable coding standards document http://cppbestpractices.com.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
