title: 'Apache Metron: Centralised Security Monitoring and Analysis with Big Data Technologies'
recordingDate: 1484714271
description: "Nik Lam, Ned Shawa\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/162/\nApache Metron, formerly OpenSOC, integrates a variety of open source big data technologies in order to offer a centralized tool for security monitoring and analysis. Metron provides capabilities for log aggregation, full packet capture indexing, storage, advanced behavioral analytics and data enrichment, while applying the most current threat-intelligence information to security telemetry within a single platform.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we'll provide an introduction to key big data elements used in Metron, such as NiFi, Storm, HDFS and HBase. We'll look at each one in the context of its role in Metron, with the goal of providing those who are new to these technologies sufficient background to apply Metron in a POC of their own."
