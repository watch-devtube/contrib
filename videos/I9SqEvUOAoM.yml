description: "Would Chuck Norris ask you to come hear him speak at a conference? No, he wouldn't. He would TELL you that you're coming, and then roundhouse kick you in the face if you gave him any more lip.\n\n\"What would Chuck Norris do?\" is a philosophy this session will cover in depth. Other topics include: badass vs a-hole, human duck typing, the art of [not] caring, instrumentality, and what your facial hair says about you. You won't learn any new code in this session, but you might unleash a Pandora's box of awesomeness that will change the way you interact with your coworkers forever."
