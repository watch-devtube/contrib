description: "Connecting and Testing Virtual Network Topologies on Kubernetes - Rich Renner & Gage Orsburn, One Source Integrations \n\nToday's complex, agile networking setups demand the same CI/CD and automated testing support as user-facing applications have. But you can't simulate an entire networking topology with Kubernetes. Or can you?  The declarative approach of Kubernetes makes it simple to recreate and orchestrate distributed applications for continuous integration. In this session we are going to talk about how we used L2 device plugins to wire up the different parts of our applications. And how KubeVirt allowed us to even test pre-existing virtual network appliances in the very same setup.  This setup enables entire enterprise topologies to be modeled and validated before released into production. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrR9"
