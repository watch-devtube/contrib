description: "Watch more from the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference: http://goo.gl/lXpXnG\n\nIt wasn’t too long ago that artisans, bathed in the glow of molten metal, forged parts that would go on to make up bigger, more powerful machines. Today, we call those artisans developers. Instead of metal, they use bits and bytes in the cloud to forge a modern application architecture.\n\nIt’s an architecture that supports public, private and hybrid application deployment. One that enables users and developers to move their applications wherever they need to go. And it’s built on a growing, vibrant ecosystem.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll give you a look at the technologies driving this new level of efficiency for application developers (tech like containers, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Cloud Foundry and social coding tools like GitHub). And I’ll explain why many prominent members of the Fortune 500 are building their futures on this modern application architecture.\n\nAbout Sam Ramji (Cloud Foundry Foundation):\nSam Ramji is CEO of the Cloud Foundry Foundation. He has over 20 years of industry experience in enterprise software, product development, and open source strategy.\n\nHe previously served as Vice President of Strategy of Apigee, one of the 5 fastest-growing software companies in the Deloitte Fast 500, and is a member of their Board of Advisors. He joined Apigee from Microsoft, where he was responsible for driving Microsoft’s worldwide open source strategy. He drove many of Microsoft’s contributions to open source and its shift to embrace open source technologies like PHP. He was a leader in BEA’s move into EAI/ESB as a founding member of the AquaLogic product team.\n\nMr. Ramji has built large-scale enterprise and Web-scale applications, leading the Ofoto engineering team through its acquisition by Kodak. His other experience includes leading engineering teams to build large-scale applications on open source software, as well as hands-on development of client, client-server and distributed applications on Unix, Windows and Macintosh at prior companies. He is a Member of the Institute for Generative Leadership. Sam holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Cognitive Science from the University of California at San Diego.\n\nHis work has been covered in Wired and many other industry publications.\n\nFor more information, visit: http://oreil.ly/1Cyt9nt\nSoftware architecture is a massive multidisciplinary subject, covering many roles and responsibilities, which makes it challenging to teach because so much context is required for every subject. It's also a fast-moving discipline, where entire suites of best practices become obsolete overnight.\n\nThe O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference is a new event designed to provide the necessary professional training that software architects and aspiring software architects need to succeed. A unique event, it covers the full scope of a software architect's job, from IT to leadership and business skills. It also provides a forum for networking and hearing what other professionals have learned in real-world experiences.\n\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia"
