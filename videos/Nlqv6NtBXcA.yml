description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nDouglas Crockford - JSON Creator & Yahoo! JS Architect\n\nABSTRACT\nMuch of programming language design is dictated by fashion. As a consequence, opinions about programming languages tend to be strong, shallow, and deeply emotional. The best languages are brilliant and sadly unfashionable. But we love our stylish, over-rated syntax, and this talk presents an amazing parsing technique that helps achieve it.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
