description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA\nSpeakers: Thomas Risberg, Janne Valkealahti \nBig data and Hadoop is widely considered to be the next generation data platform. Hadoop is notoriously difficult to work with and just diving in and starting coding can easily lead to frustration. A better way is to leverage your existing Java and Spring skills to take advantage of these new technologies. In this presentation we will introduce Spring Data for Apache Hadoop and see how it can make working with Hadoop easier. We will also cover several ways to install a small Hadoop cluster that can be used to test your new Hadoop applications."
