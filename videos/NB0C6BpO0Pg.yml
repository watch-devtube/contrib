title: 'Indecisions are not all bad - Boris Litvinsky'
recordingDate: 1531288800
description: "Software development is a process comprised of decisions made by the developers. But despite the fact that some decisions can have a long-lasting, crippling effects on our app, we make most of them based on guesses.\n\nBut what if the best decision is indecision? What if you could postpone most of your decision until you gather enough facts in order to make the optimal one?\n\nIn this talk, we will learn why deferring decisions can result in a much better, simpler code base. We’ll see examples of decisions we think we have to take, yet, can (and should) be postponed and see how practices like Spikes and the right design of your application will allow that to happen."
