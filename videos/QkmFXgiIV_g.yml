description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nGitHub repo: https://github.com/christophstrobl/spring-data-reactive-demo\n\nAlmost 6 years after its first public release the Spring Data Release train approaches a major version bump of its core modules. In this session we'll revisit key concepts of Spring Data with a strong focus on the Java8 baseline upgrade, lazy component initialization and reactive data access. Code samples outline general strategies as well as store specifics like infinite streams with MongoDB."
