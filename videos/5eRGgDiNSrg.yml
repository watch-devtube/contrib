title: 'Deep dive into ES6 iterators and generators : Dan Shappir (Hebrew)'
recordingDate: 1434361375
description: "Iterators and generators represent one of the most significant enhancements to the JavaScript language provided by ES6.\n\nIterators specify a standard mechanism for traversing over data sources, such as collections. Generators provide a convenient mechanism for implementing iterator factories in your own code.\n\nIn this session Dan dove into the technical details of iterators and generators, and taught us how to best leverage their capabilities."
