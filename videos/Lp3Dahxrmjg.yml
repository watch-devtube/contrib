title: 'Sebastian Bełczyk - Build Reliable Systems with Virtual Actors'
recordingDate: 1475501105
description: "\"Build Reliable Systems with Virtual Actors\"\n\nActor model is a computational model specifically suited for building distributed, high-performance, fault tolerant systems. However, the popular actor model platforms still leave many distributed system problems to the developers.\n\nVirtual Actors is an abstraction over actor model which helps developers deal with reliability and distributed resource management at the same time retaining the best traits of actor model.\n\nOrleans was the first framework which implements runtime for virtual actors. In this talk I’ll explain what are virtual actors and show you how to use them to build reliable, distributed applications."
