description: "Karen M. Sandler\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/39/\nLet's face it, GNU/Linux is no youngster! Many developers are aging and as with \r\nany large group of people, we must plan for the sad but inevitable loss of \r\ncontributors. We have already lost a number of extremely important people in our \r\ncommunity.  In this talk, Karen will discuss the legal and social implications of \r\nthis transition, like:\r\n\r\n* What will happen to my copyrights when I die?\r\n    * What if I don't have a will?\r\n    * What if I do?\r\n    * What are my options?\r\n* What are the challenges my free software project will face as contributors die?\r\n* How do we keep track of everything as time passes?\r\n\r\nAfter many years of struggling with the legal solutions to these problems, Karen \r\nwill propose possible mechanisms we can put in place (with suprising ancillary \r\nadvantages) and discuss pragmatic next stesp."
