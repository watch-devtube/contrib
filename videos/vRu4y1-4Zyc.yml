description: "Oleg Chunikhin, Kublr\n\nAbstract: \nContainers and Kubernetes are becoming the de-facto standard for software distribution, management, and operations. Development teams see and realize the power of these technologies to improve efficiencies, save time, and enable focus on the unique business requirements of each project, but the process of deploying, running, managing, and handling upgrades for Kubernetes is time-consuming and requires significant in-house expertise. InfoSec, infrastructure, and software operations teams, for example, face myriad challenges when managing a new set of tools and technologies as they integrate them into an existing enterprise infrastructure.\n\nIn this session, Oleg Chunikhin, CTO at Kublr, will provide an overview of the general architecture of a centralized Kubernetes operations layer based on open-source components such as Prometheus, Graphana, ELK Stack, KeyCloak, etc. From there, he will outline the unique challenges to consider for each of the following critical elements before embarking on a containerization and Kubernetes strategy:\n\nCentralized monitoring and log collection; audit\nIdentity and access management\nBackup and disaster recovery\nInfrastructure management\nBy looking at each of these areas, attendees will leave with an understanding of how to ensure successful container and Kubernetes ‘Day 2’ operations.\n\nView the full LISA18 Program at https://www.usenix.org/lisa18/conference-program"
