description: "Google Tech Talks\nApril, 22 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nCosmic radiation presents a very real threat to astronauts. As part\nof a NASA funded project to evaluate the cancer risks of a trip to Mars,\nDr. Costes' team has been collecting hundreds of gigabytes of 3D and\n4D imagery showing the traversal of cosmic particles in human cells,\nand characterizing the DNA damage along those tracks to reveal the\nexistence of DNA repair factories.\n\nIn addition to sharing his project with us, Dr. Costes will discuss\nhow they've overcome some of the challenges in 3D image registration\nand segmentation, pattern recognition and classification, and storing,\norganizing and browsing through thousands of images and experimental\nmeasurements.\n\nSpeaker: Sylvain Costes\nDr. Costes is a principal investigator in the Life Sciences Division of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory."
