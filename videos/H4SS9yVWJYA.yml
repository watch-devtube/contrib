description: "Speaker: Jason Fried\n\nToday, services built on Python 3.6.3 are widely used at Facebook. But as recently as May of 2014 it was actually impossible at all to use Python 3 at Facebook. Come learn how we cut the Gordian Knot of dependencies and social aversion to the point where new services are now being written in Python 3 while older Python 2 projects are actively migrated to Python 3. All accomplished by a small group of individual contributors in their spare time. Learn to fight the good fight and upgrade your organization to Python 3 like we did at Facebook.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
