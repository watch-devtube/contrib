The drastic performance improvements and overall efficiency has resulted in PHP 7 adoption rates well beyond past PHP versions. If you are not on PHP 7 yet, you will learn why you should be, but the talk will focus more on new features in PHP 7.2 and 7.3 along with optimization and static analysis.\n\nEVENT:\n\n.concat() 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRasmus Lerdorf\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umxGUWYmiSw"
