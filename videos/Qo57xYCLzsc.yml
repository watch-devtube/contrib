description: "Controlling and building a single robot is already a challenge, but how would that work if you want to have a swarm of robots interact with each other? How do we control and interact with them whilst all robots are slightly different?\n\nIn this session we will have some fun and hook up a Nao Aldebaran robot and a Raspberry PI based robot to the cloud and let them interact with each other. We will do this using the latest technologies using a bunch of micro-services deployed as docker containers on a Kubernetes cluster running on AWS.\n\nThe ultimate proof is in a demo where these robots can interact with each other using those docker containers to act as the bridge via the AWS Kubernetes setup\n\nRenze de Vries\nI am an experienced Developer that has turned into a technology evangelist / innovation manager. I am busy promotion latest in technologies, currently actively evangelist containerisation with Docker, Kubernetes and Spring boot based microservices.\n\nI created several open source projects on github including my own NoSQL database and a full home automation platform and these days my robotics initiatives.\n\nI have had a life long passion about robotics and the ability to control devices and robots in the real world based on the programs and software i write. These days i am actively pursuing this as part of my own innovation company.\n\n[YTQ-0303]"
