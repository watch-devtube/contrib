description: "Can Ripple be considered a cryptocurrency? Is it centralized? Why is it getting adopted by so many banks so fast? Lots of questions, I'm going to answer them all in this video. We'll also build a simple minimalist Ripple Client to act as a wallet in javascript using the Ripple API. I'll go over the architecture and explain the concepts of gateways, market makers, and validator nodes in the network.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Ripple_Explained\n\nPlease Subscribe!
