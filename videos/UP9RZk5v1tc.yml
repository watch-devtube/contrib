title: 'Running 100 miles through the Himalaya - Elizabeth Weil'
recordingDate: 1376610693
description: 'I ran a 100-mile race in the Himalaya in November, 2012. Route was along the border of India and Nepal. 33,000 feet of climbing at 10,000 feet elevation. I didn''t have much time to train, so I just had to convince my body to do it--fueld by boiled potatoes, water, and bananas. I was the first woman to finish, and here''s my story.'
