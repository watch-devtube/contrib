language: English
recordingDate: 1449669433
description: "In this session, we'll introduce OpenShift v3 and show how it can be used to support DevOps methods, microservices application architectures and application continuous delivery. \n\n\nWe'll: \n* look at the technical benefits that Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) provide. \n* show how to refactor monolithic applications to take maximum advantage of these benefits. \n* show how PaaS improves innovation and time to market by simplifying continuous delivery of applications across multiple environments. \n\nAs an illustration, we'll adapt the JBoss EAP TicketMonster sample application, extending it with JBoss Fuse messaging and integration components and a persistent database, hosting these as separate services across multiple environments on OpenShift v3.\n\nKeith Lynch \n(keith_lynch)\n\nKeith works for Red Hat and leads the Application Development business in the UK. When not being a farther he spends more time than he should on front of a keyboard. He’s an open source fanatic and evangelist and likes to talk about how Red Hat can help businesses to build solutions on top of enterprise supported open source platforms. He has a background rich in consulting, software development, integration and business rules."
