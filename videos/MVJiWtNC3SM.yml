Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe in Barcelona, May 20–23 (https://bit.ly/2B2vhMl), in Shanghai, June 24–26 (https://bit.ly/2JZcBjs), or in San Diego November 18–21 (https://bit.ly/2K031wW) in 2019.\n\nProduction Cluster Monitoring and Remediation for High Reliability at eBay - Shijun Qian & YingKe Liu, eBay\n\neBay runs dozens of Kubernetes clusters across global data centers in different regions. Tens of thousands of nodes support eBay core services such as search and big data. Complex large cross-regional production clusters and the extremely high cluster stability required workloads make monitoring and remediation a huge challenge for us. Based on Prometheus federation, component assertions, metric exporters and our own monitoring tools, we built a series of clear dashboards, and then we implemented a complete cross-clusters remediation flow, incident management, and monitoring automation. In this talk, we hope to share our large-scale Kubernetes production clusters monitoring experience and future thoughts.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuK6"
