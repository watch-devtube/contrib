language: English
recordingDate: 1433515681
description: "The new Portlet 3.0 standard, which is well under development, will enable portlet developers to leverage the power of the Java EE 7 platform. New features will include support for CDI, OpenSocial, client-side processing, and WebSocket. In addition, support will be improved for mobile devices and JavaServer Faces (JSF). This session provides you with an overview of these new features and how JSF developers will benefit. You will also learn how JSF 2.2 can be used with today’s Portlet 2.0 bridges to build HTML5 portlet applications.\n\n\nAuthors:\nEdward Burns\nEd Burns is a Senior Staff Engineer for Oracle Corporation where he chairs the JSR 344 (JSF 2.2) Expert Group and contributes to the open source Mojarra project.
