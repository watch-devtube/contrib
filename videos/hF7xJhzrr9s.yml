Forget complicated deploys with databases and servers and their expensive, time-consuming setup costs, maintenance, and scaling fears. Gatsby.js builds your site as “static” files which can be deployed easily on dozens of services.\n\nFuture-proof your website\nDon't build a website with last decade's tech. The future of the web is mobile, JavaScript and APIs—the JAMstack. Every website is a web app and every web app is a website. Gatsby.js is the universal JavaScript framework you’ve been waiting for.\n\nStatic Progressive Web Apps\nGatsby.js is a static PWA (Progressive Web App) generator. You get code and data splitting out-of-the-box. Gatsby loads only the critical HTML, CSS, data, and JavaScript so your site loads as fast as possible. Once loaded, Gatsby prefetches resources for other pages so clicking around the site feels incredibly fast.\n\nSpeed past the competition\nGatsby.js builds the fastest possible website. Instead of waiting to generate pages when requested, pre-build pages and lift them into a global cloud of servers — ready to be delivered instantly to your users wherever they are."
