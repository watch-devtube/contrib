description: "OWASP illustrates that developers keep making the same mistakes over and over again, but what about more esoteric vulnerabilities?\n\nIn this session Barry will take you beyond SQL injection covering some of the code behind now fixed ASP.NET vulnerabilities. By the end of the session you should be poring through your own code looking for problems with dictionaries, compression, encryption and more."
