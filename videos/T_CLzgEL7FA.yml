description: "Google I/O 2010 - GWT testing best practices \r\n\r\nGWT 301 \r\n\r\nDaniel Danilatos \r\n\r\nGWT has a lot of little-publicized infrastructure that can help you build apps The Right Way: test-driven development, code coverage, comprehensive unit tests, and integration testing using Selenium or WebDriver. This session will survey GWT's testing infrastructure, describe some best practices we've developed at Google, and help you avoid common pitfalls. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
