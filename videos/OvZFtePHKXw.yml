description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nIntake is a simple library providing a single interface for cataloging, describing and reading any kind of data. Catalogs give end-users an easy way to find data, locally, in a cloud service, or on an Intake server. Thus, Intake separates the definition of data sources from their use and analysis, so that Data Engineers and Data Scientists can get on with their respective jobs.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17roiO4Rk-e9-MFCUVATEM16RpGIWvxgH_ND8UTpuiSA/edit?usp=sharing\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
