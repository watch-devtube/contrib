description: "Find more information here: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/keyvi-key-value-index-optimized-size-and-speed\n\nYet another key-value store? No, it's an index not a store and it is based on 'Finite State technology', but what does that mean?\n\nKeyvi - the short form for \"Key value index\" - defines a special subtype of the popular key value store (KVS) technologies. As you can imagine from the name, keyvi is an immutable key value store, therefore an index not a store. Keyvi's strengths: high compression ratio and extreme scalability.\n\nKeyvi powers Cliqz Websearch engine, replacing former engines based on Redis and Elastic Search. Serving terrabytes of data at scale and low-latency, keyvi is already proven technology while still being a young OSS project.\n\nBut keyvi is also different to well-established NoSQL engines, it is not an efficient implementation of well-known, common used data structures like hash tables and B-Trees. It brings finite state not only to the same level, but efficiently allows approximate, completion and graph matching to boldy go where NoSql hasn't gone before.\n\nThis session will introduce keyvi, show it's strengths, capabilities and finally look deep into the heart of it's data structures."
