description: "Google TechTalks\nJuly 21, 2006\n\nGuido van Rossum is a computer programmer who is best known as the author and Benevolent Dictator for Life of the Python programming language.\n\nABSTRACT\nThe next major version of Python, nicknamed Python 3000 (or more prosaically Python 3.0), has been anticipated for a long time. For years I have been collecting and exploring ideas that were too radical for Python 2.x, and it's time to stop dreaming and start coding. In this talk I will present the community process that will be used to complete the specification for Python 3000, as well as some of the major changes to the language and the remaining challenges."
