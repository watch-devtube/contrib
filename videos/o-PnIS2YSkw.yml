description: "Java EE developers are increasingly required to embrace thin-server-architecture client application development while leveraging their existing components. On the surface, this appears to simply mean using the JAX-RS to expose RESTful services. But the real challenges are often misunderstood and underestimated. The EclipseLink project has solved a large part of this problem through its new JPA-RS feature, which provides a way for developers to expose their persistent entities over REST with support for all lifecycle operations and query execution. In building JPA-RS, EclipseLink has faced and overcome many of the challenges developers face when realizing a resource model, addressing HATEOS, and the infrastructure for JSON and XML binding.
