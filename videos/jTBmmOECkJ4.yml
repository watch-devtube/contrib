description: "In the ongoing war between the frameworks - there seem to be two that are head and shoulders above the rest. Is there really room for anything else or will all the upstarts be left bleeding in the dust even if they are objectively at least as good if not better then the major players?\n\nWell. This talk strikes a blow for Vue.js. It has survived its test of fire in regards to staying power. Its faster than the competition. It is easier to write, easier to read and does all the things the main combatants in the arena do (you can even write JSX if you like). In 2016, it got more stars on github than any other js-framework and is now up to 42.500 (comparable to Reacts 60K).\n\nThat said. Will this talk change your mind to switch to Vue from React or Angular? Maybe not, but I will make a (strong) case for it anyway! We will have a look at what makes Vue unique but also (it is really hard not to) make a quick comparison to React since the two are really similar."
