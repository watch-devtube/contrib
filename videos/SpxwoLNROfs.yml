title: 'How Lucidchart Scales with Play, Akka, and Scala'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433505024
description: "Although it’s now easier than ever to create Web applications, creating Web applications that will scale to handle the traffic and amount of data that modern applications require can be a challenge. By using an asynchronous, nonblocking architecture, Play, Akka, and Scala form a great toolset for building applications that can scale both up (utilizing multicore processors) and out (utilizing the grid/cloud to add more machines). This session first explores why these patterns are important in modern applications and then discusses how Lucidchart has used Scala, Play, and Akka in its architecture to increase scalability, availability, and performance.\n\n\nAuthors:\nRyan Knight\nRyan Knight is a Senior Consultant at Typesafe on the Professional Services team where he does consulting and training for Scala, Akka and Play. He frequently does training and presentations at conferences around the world, such as JavaOne, Devoxx, and many other Java get–togethers. He has over 15 years of experience with enterprise software development. He first started consulting with Enterprise Java in 1999 with the Sun Java Center.\nView more trainings by Ryan Knight at https://www.parleys.com/author/ryan-knight\n\nBrian Pugh\nBrian has extensive experience designing, developing, testing and deploying web applications.
