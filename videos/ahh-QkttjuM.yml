description: "A talk from Barcelona Ruby Conference 2013 (http://baruco.org)\n\nLet's open the day talking about programming languages, the progress of science, and a few things that didn't go quite as planned in the last half-millennium - from the Problem of Longitude to the resurrection of LISP, passing by debuggers and type systems. At the end of it all, one question: are you a hunter or a gatherer?\n\nhttp://www.baruco.org/talks/hunters-and-gatherers\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)"
