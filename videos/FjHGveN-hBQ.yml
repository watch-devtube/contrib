description: "This is not your father's weather forecast. Businesses across the commercial spectrum can be positively and negatively affected by weather conditions in deep and sometimes unanticipated ways. Whether they are surprise acute weather events (ie., weather black swans) or prolonged patterns that slowly enhance or curtail product demand, it is hard to find an industry that does not have some sort of operational or financial exposure to the atmosphere.\n\nHear how companies in sectors ranging from banks managing commodity risk to home centers staging seasonal demand driven products are are analyzing weather in different ways to get ahead, and how they can tap into the unexploited possibilities of the treasure trove of government maintained weather data.\n\nMichael Ferrari\n\nComputer Sciences Corporation\n\nMichael Ferrari is the Director of Climate Informatics and Senior Scientist at CSC, where he is working with the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center on developing commercial tools and applications from their data and models. He also serves on the American Meteorological Society Board of Societal Impacts of Weather and Climate. For the past five years, Michael served as the vice president and director of applied research at Weather Trends International. His primary research interests lie at the interface of climate science, environmental modeling/analysis, and the subsequent development of commercial applications that can benefit from this research. Michael is a frequent speaker at both scientific and commodity conferences around the world, where his talks focus on the confluence of weather, climate and their relationship to society, with a particular emphasis on weather and agriculture/energy considerations, extreme events, risk quantification and natural hazards. In addition, he builds data-driven tools for the physical commodity and risk management sectors utilizing global weather, satellite-derived, economic and sensor network data. Michael holds a PhD in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics and Evolutionary Biology from Rutgers. Follow him on Twitter: @aeroculus."
