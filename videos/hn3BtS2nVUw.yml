description: "*Note - Recorded from a Live Event - Audio a bit Choppy\n\nFrom canvas to web workers and file transfer to blob management, join us for a hands-on webcast to see HTML5 demos and code samples that will have you rethinking the possibilities of browser based apps. Watch the competitiveness mount, as these two innovative Hackers try to one-up each other through demonstrations of each of their most inspired hacks.\n\nAbout Jeff Burtoft\n\nHackers Jeff Burtoft and Jesse Cravens, co-authors of O'Reilly 'HTML5 Hacks', approach HTML5 and JavaScript technologies from vastly different vantage points.\n\nJeff works as an HTML5 Evangelist for a global technology company (Microsoft), lives in the Pacific NW and focuses on IE10 implementations of the new HTML5 specifications and JavaScript powered native applications. Jeff writes code in Visual Studio on Windows 8, runs Node.js on Windows Azure and thinks web standards should be ratified by Congress.
