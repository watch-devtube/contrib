description: "Avishai Ish-Shalom, Aleph VC\n\nWe live in a world of shiny new tech introduced all the time. Heck, we even made cars that drive themselves. Yet all around us, unseen and hidden, lurk ancient, forgotten systems. They're in our kernels, our terminals and our CPUs... They are everywhere. This is the story of how remnants of dead systems continue to haunt us in present days and why we can't seem to get rid of them.\n\nLegacy is a fact of life, riddled with hacks and weird workarounds that have survived 30+ years. We all complain about it, yet are building tomorrow's legacy systems today. The aim of this talk (besides being amusing) is to raise awareness for End-Of-Life phase of software products.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
