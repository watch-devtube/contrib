language: English
recordingDate: 1305217080
description: "Nicholas Verne, Vivek Sahasranaman\r\n\r\nDoes your app require software that you can't run on App Engine? By using the brand new pull based queues, you can crunch through all sorts of work like OCR, video encoding, and image manipulation in a VM. Add work to queues using App Engine's Task Queue API and process the tasks in a VM by pulling from queues using the REST API. Pull queues open up a lot of new possibilities for your apps so come and hear from the team that built this functionality and bring your questions!"
