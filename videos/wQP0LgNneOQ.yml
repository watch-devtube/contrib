description: "Java EE 7 continues the simplification of the APIs for accessing container services while broadening the range of services available. This platform overview focuses on the following areas:\n\n&bull; Extension of the platform to encompass emerging Web technologies such as WebSocket and JSON, which provide the underpinnings for HTML5 support in Java EE, as well as the HTTP client API added by JAX-RS\n\n&bull; Simplified alignment of managed beans by the leveraging of CDI injection and interceptors to include new JTA declarative transactions, method-level validation, and constructor injection\n\n&bull; Enhancements for ease of use, including simplified JMS APIs, the new batch API, expanded resource definition facilities, and the pruning of superseded technologies\n\n\nAuthor:\nLinda DeMichiel\nLinda DeMichiel is a senior architect in the Java EE Platform group at Sun Microsystems and the chief architect for Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0 and the Java Persistence API. As the Specification Lead for JSR-220, she was responsible for launching and leading the initiatives for Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0 and the Java Persistence API under the Java Community Process.  She has over 20 years of experience in the areas of databases, object persistence, distributed computing, and OO in both industry and research. Before assuming responsibility for EJB, she led the team that implemented Sun's first object/relational persistence product, and worked earlier at IBM on object/relational extensions to both DB2 and the SQL99 standard. She holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University.\nView more trainings by Linda DeMichiel at https://www.parleys.com/author/linda-demichiel\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
