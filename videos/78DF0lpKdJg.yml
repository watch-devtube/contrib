description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune 14, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nConcurrent programming is increasingly important and existing programming models are inadequate for this challenge. Transactional memory is the most promising and popular research direction to address these concerns. Software transactional memory is too slow and hardware transactional memory is too complex. Hybrid Transactional Memory runs in existing systems today, but can exploit \"best effort\" hardware transactional memory support in the future to boost performance. This approach enables and encourages incremental adoption of transactional memory. This talk will describe our recent work on Hybrid Transactional Memory, and some of our other efforts to..."
