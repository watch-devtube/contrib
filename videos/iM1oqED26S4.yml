recordingDate: 1523543114
description: "This session will explore the gift and the curse of the famously un-opinionated ReactJS, and answer some of the most pressing questions not covered by the documentation:\n\n\n\nHow do I separate my display logic and my business logic?\n\nWhat's the right way to connect our components to an external API?\n\nWhat's the right way to manage state?\n\n\n\nThis session will demonstrate how design patterns can be used to abstract away our business logic. This improves the separation of concerns. Furthermore, higher order components can be used to make our logic composable and reusable. It will also introduce an important state-management technique used in most large-scale React applications in production today. Attendees will leave this session knowing how to use:\n\n\n\nPresentational/container components\n\nRender Props\n\nThe Flux pattern of stage-management"
