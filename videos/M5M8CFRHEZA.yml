title: 'The proper care and feeding of communities and carnivorous plants'
recordingDate: 1485403597
description: "Rikki Endsley\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/168/\nIn 2016, I adopted my first carnivorous plant, a Venus Fly Trap, which I named Gordon. I quickly discovered that, in addition to his ability to catch the occasional bug and get energy from the sun, Gordon's health was closely connected to the environment and care I provided. In this talk, I'll draw from more than a decade of experience working with open source communities (and a few months of experience keeping Gordon alive) to explain how caring for a Venus Fly Trap is much like caring for a community. Like carnivorous plants, communities can't be left alone to fend for themselves, and they won't explicitly tell you when there is a problem. Communities and carnivorous plants need an energy source, healthy environments, pest control, and occasional maintenance. Whether you're a seasoned community gardener, or just starting to develop your carnivorous plant green thumb, you'll learn practical tips for nurturing healthy roots that grow thriving communities (... or Venus Fly Traps)."
