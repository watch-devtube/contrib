description: "This talk will explain how \"building the right thing right\" & implementing a \"shared value\" competitive strategy can have a massive impact for social good as well as internal engineering, design & delivery culture.\n\nIts shared wisdom now that by utilising design thinking techniques to build the right thing we can get closer to and empathise more with the community and answer the question of \"should we build it\"? Its also now well known that by teams baking in all the goodness of a well informed agile process & culture (cross functional teams, visualisation, TDD, CI, CD, devops etc) delivering the next most worthwhile opportunity happens effectively.\n\nHowever rather than just trying to find the next widget to make a dollar off, social entrepreneurs and for purpose organisations are zeroing in on environmental & social challenges to crack which not only give them the edge over solutions with less soul, they can deliver meaningful sustained impact at scale and bake in social good as part of BAU.\n\nDEREK:\nLover of Product Management, building the right thing right, visual communication & transparency in cross functional teams.\n\nProduct Delivery dude holding 3 roles.\n\n  1.  Founder of an ethical technology company Septa\n  2. Principal Consultant for Pragmateam\n  3. Community Manager for Random Hacks of Kindness rhokaustralia.org\n\nPHIL:\nPhil helps companies, NGOs and government apply shared value principles to create social change at scale: it's about finding the points where the business agenda intersects with societal needs.\n\nIn comparing social engagements by companies:\n- Philanthropy is motivated by corporate conscience\n- Social responsibility is about managing downside risk; and\n- Shared value embeds larger scale win-wins in business-as-usual.\n\nAs an independent practitioner, Phil helps organisations identify and bring shared value opportunities to life using a range of idea creation, development and implementation tools.\n\nHe was invited by Michael Porter and Mark Kramer to Boston in 2013 to help form the inaugural global practitioner network, and co-created Shared Value 101 workshops with the Australian peak body.\n\nPhil is an acclaimed keynote speaker at events who also possesses outstanding facilitation and panel session hosting skills.\n\nSUSAN:\nIn her 30+ years in the field, there's probably no user experience design challenge that Susan hasn't seen. In both San Francisco and Sydney, Susan has practiced UX design, run consultancies, mentored project teams around the globe, introduced UX design practices and cultures into organisations, and trained the next generation of practitioners. She’s launched and run consultancies in Sydney and, in years past, established and managed in-house UX teams within software, hardware, and services companies in Silicon Valley. Over time, she has become increasingly focused on using UX design for social good.\n\nSusan currently teaches the UX Design Immersive course at General Assembly and consults through her boutique consultancy, OE Strategy.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
