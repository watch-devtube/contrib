description: "Big data isn't just an abstract problem for corporations, financial firms, and tech companies. To your mother, a 'big data' problem might simply be too much email, or a lost file on her computer.\n\nWe need to democratize access to the tools used for understanding information by taking the hard-work out of drawing insight from excessive quantities of information. To help humans process content more efficiently and to help them capture more of their world.\n\nTools to effectively do this need to be visual, intuitive, and quick. This talk looks at some of the data visualization platforms that are helping to solve big data problems for normal people.\n\nJonathan Gosier\n\nmetaLayer Inc.\n\nJonathan Gosier is a designer, software developer, lover of data science and the co-founder of metaLayer.com which aims to change how you analyze content by offering products for atomizing and visualizing data.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2011 he served as Director of Product for SwiftRiver at Ushahidi working on an open-source platform for drawing insight from real-time communication during crisis events. The SwiftRiver project was awarded the 2011 Knight News Challenge award for its potential to improve the data journalism and news gathering process.\n\nIn 2009 Jon spoke at TED in Oxford, UK about his company Appfrica and one of their projects which connected rural African villages with the internet through a call center and light infrastructure. The service, in collaboration with non-profit OpenMind, was called QuestionBox and allowed people with no access to the internet to ask questions and get timely, vetted answers.\n\nJon is also the organizer of the annual Apps4Africa competition which encourages African software developers to develop solutions to local problems.\n\nIn addition to TED, Jon has been invited to present at the Economist's Ideas Economy, Google Zeitgeist and Personal Democracy Forum.
