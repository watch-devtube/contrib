description: 'In the fast paced world of the start up, there is no time for perfection. We''re too busy creating and shipping software so that we can keep ourselves ahead of our competitors. Moving fast often means making a compromise when it comes to perfection. But should we go think a step beyond the compromise and positively embrace the idea of imperfection? I''ll talk about why and how we should actively reject perfection and why doing so will keep everyone happy.'
