description: "PyData London Meetup #49\nTuesday, October 2, 2018\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently reached a few tremendous milestones: generating full-HD synthetic faces, to image compression better than the state of the art to cryptography. In this talk, we will start with the basics of generative models, but eventually, explore the state of the art in generating full HD images as presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196\n\nSponsored & Hosted by Man AHL \n\n****\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
