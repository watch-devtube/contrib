description: "Speaker(s): Jimish Parekh (Ahmedabad)\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nSmart Devices do need to talk to servers lying on some cloud. This talk will include basic knowledge of Node-Red framework of Nodejs, which can be used as MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transportation) Broker and HTTP Api server. So any developer can communicate to devices (publish/subscribe) using MQTT protocol and they can develop any REST APIs using http feature of Node-Red. Node-Red is drag and drop, light weight framework built upon Nodejs. Now, developer can develop a API in lesser time that he/she takes to make a cup of coffee.\r\n\r\n(Type: Workshop | Track: Security and Privacy | Room: Faraday (Floor 3))\r\n\r\nEvent Page: http://2017.fossasia.org\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/5LZN/"
