description: "Getting content ready for launch is tough for all involved, especially clients. They are often faced with two challenges - tailoring their content to audience needs and restructuring their content to align with the architecture of the new site.\n\nIt can take months for product owners to develop content, a process that relies on writing the content and managing internal feedback cycles from the CEO to program-level staff. \_Clients who envision a seamless transition between development and launch are faced with a mad dash of content entry, or a protracted pre-launch period where the development team is no longer available to respond to questions.\n\nMany of the current solutions available to developers and content strategists pose problems as well. Allowing clients to access the development environment so they can add content as the site is built can introduce unexpected configuration changes and create duplicative work when developers need to make architectural changes to content types or taxonomy. \_Updating and restructuring content on an existing Drupal 6 or 7 site in preparation for migration can limit the client's ability to restructure content. It can also create missed opportunities for the client to update critical information architecture structures like the primary navigation and taxonomies.\n\nWe gave our client, AcademyHealth, a solution that we’re going to share with you today - an external content development tool (GatherContent) integrated with our Drupal 8 development process.\n\nThis approach allowed the client team to:\n\nRestructure their old content and prepare new content well in advance of development. \_experiment and explore content hierarchy independent of design or technical implementation\n\nEvaluate how their content and menu structure functioned within the site at the end of each sprint during development\n\nHave a quick turnaround time between the end of development and the site launch\n\nAnd allowed our team to:\n\nHave open conversations with the client about content structure early on in the project\n\nConfine client content to mutually-defined structure using content fields and templates\n\nMake design and development decisions based on real content\n\nSeamlessly migrate client-curated content to development environments using the GatherContent API with Drupal 8\n\nIN THIS SESSION, YOU’LL LEARN HOW TO:\n\nUse GatherContent to create content\n\nMigrate structured content in conjunction with Drupal 8\n\nCollaborate with clients in planning, structuring and curating content prior to development\n\nWHO THIS SESSION IS FOR:\n\nContent Editors\n\nDevelopers/Engineers\n\nContent Strategists\n\nUX practitioners\n\nProject Managers"
