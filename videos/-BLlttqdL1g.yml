description: "Speaker: CHRISTIAN DUPUIS CO-FOUNDER, ATOMIST\nSpring Boot and friends are awesome frameworks for building applications including those made up of microservices. With start.spring.io you can get up and running very quickly. It gets more challenging when you have to evolve your disparate codebases over time, collaborate inside and across your teams, and operate lots of services consistently across the whole lifecycle; from issue to commit, from successful build to deploy. In this talk you'll learn how Atomist can help you bring your entire organisation's Spring-based development process into Slack and increase the level of automation, collaboration, speed and consistency when developing, integrating and operating larger and larger systems."
