description: 'It''s hard to imagine a modern developer workflow without a sufficiently advanced build system: Make, Gradle, Maven, Rake, and many others. In this talk, we''ll discuss the evolution of build systems that leads to distributed build systems. Then, we''ll dive into how we can build a scalable system that is fast and resilient, with examples from Google. We''ll conclude with the discussion of general challenges of migrating systems from one architecture to another.'
