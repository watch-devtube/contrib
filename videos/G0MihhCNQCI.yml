title: 'Reaktor Talks: Vesa Karvonen, Compositional data manipulation using lenses'
recordingDate: 1488184810
description: 'Lenses are a simple and powerful abstraction for updating and querying immutable data structures. A lens can be seen as a path to focus on an element of a data structure. The lens can then be used to both read the focused element and to substitute a new element into the focus, creating a new data structure. Lenses allow one to create complex data manipulation operations from simple parts.'
