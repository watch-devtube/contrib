description: "bol.com is the largest (online) retailer in the Netherlands & Belgium. Frederieke Ubels joined the company when it was 2 years old, in 2001, as head of their bookstore. In 2008 She switched to IT and helped implement scrum in the whole company - then around 100 people. Since then they've grown very fast, to 1,400 people. At the moment she's part of their IT & the bol.com management team. Within these teams she's responsible for their business & IT innovation process and agile coaching. Also she's participating in or leading large IT programs or projects. To make sure their innovation process is as effective and efficient as can be, she focuses on removing bottlenecks: on the business side as well as within IT. In the past years she was responsible for their transformation from 'just agile' to DevOps, the only way for the company to make sure that they could grow & scale any further.\n\nDevOps Year 3: What's It Like When DevOps Is Just Another Day at the Office? - Frederieke Ubels\n\nDOES18 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
