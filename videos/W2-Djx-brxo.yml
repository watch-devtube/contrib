They’re creating a new TypeScript library, and they want to give developers who use their library the best possible experience. They know that TypeScript has incredible powers (they’re almost magical! 💫), but they don’t know exactly how to use them to their full potential.\n\nThey have so many questions! What is unknown? How is it different from any? How do you use infer? What are conditional types? Unions and Intersections?! It’s almost too much…\n\nThankfully Elsa, beloved Queen of Arendelle is a TypeScript master, and along with her sister Anna, they love to teach others all about type magic.\n\nCome along with Elsa, Anna, Olaf and Sven, and learn all about advanced TypeScript typing by going INTO THE UNKNOWN 🎶❄️🎵\n\nWatch all the ng-conf: Hardwired presentations/videos at https://videos.ng-conf.org\n\nng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.\n\nng-conf: Hardwired is brought to you by:\n- https://thinkster.io/ The best Angular and JavaScript tutorials on the web\n- https://herodevs.com/ Engineering and consulting by web development experts\n- https://xlts.dev/  Extended support for AngularJS\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
