title: 'Let There Be Peace On CSS - Cristiano Rastelli - Codemotion Amsterdam 2018'
language: English
recordingDate: 1530692055
description: 'In the last few months there''s been a growing friction between those who see CSS as an untouchable layer in the "separation of concerns" paradigm, and those who have simply ignored this golden rule and found different ways to style the UI (typically applying CSS styles via JavaScript). This debate have brought division in a community that used to be immune to this kind of “wars”. This talk is my attempt to bring peace between the two fronts. To help these two opposite factions to understand and listen to each other, see the counterpart''s points of views.'
