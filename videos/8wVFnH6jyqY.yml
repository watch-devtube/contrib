title: 'Bringing new life to the view layer of Spring web apps with Thymeleaf by Daniel Fernández'
recordingDate: 1465890480
description: "Spring I/O 2016 - 19 -20 May Barcelona\n\nThe view layer of Java web applications has undergone a profound transformation along the last years, with the advent of so many client-side frameworks and the move of significant parts of the user interface responsibilities to the browser side. But this has never meant the complete dismissal of the server side as an important factor in the building of web user interfaces, and newer architectures are increasingly stressing the need for good server-side template technologies that work together with the client side in order to create the best and most efficient possible UIs.\n\nAt the same time, the growing mismatch between web design and software development has not helped reducing the overlap and the conflict between the teams and tools that bring data to the view layer and those in charge of representing such data in the most useful and visually appealing way.\n\nThymeleaf recently appeared in this scenario as a modern Java template engine for the server side aimed at offering the most satisfactory developer experience possible, at the same time as providing a good integration for client-side frameworks during the development process. And it is currently doing so with some degree of success, having become the view layer of choice for many teams, especially in the Spring MVC and Spring Boot ecosystems.\n\nThis talk will cover the core Thymeleaf concepts as well as its usage in Spring web applications, and also show the new exciting features included in Thymeleaf 3.0."
