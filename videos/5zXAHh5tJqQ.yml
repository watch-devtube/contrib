title: 'GopherCon 2018: Bryan C. Mills - Rethinking Classical Concurrency Patterns'
language: English
recordingDate: 1536936362
description: 'Developers tend to learn a set of general concurrency patterns and apply them across programming languages. Go''s lightweight goroutines and concurrency primitives significantly change the cost/benefit tradeoffs for those patterns. In this tutorial session, Bryan will examine common “classical” concurrency patterns — such as worker pools, asynchronous callbacks, futures, and condition variables — and demonstrate some of the alternatives that Go enables.'
