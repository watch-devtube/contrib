description: 'Users often don''t complete an activity in one sitting or through a single channel. Sometimes users are interrupted, sometimes it is more appropriate to switch device, or they move from the digital world to the physical world (and vice versa) by choice or necessity. For these reasons, it''s important to offer a seamless experience as users move from channel to channel to complete activities. This experience report will give practical advice for cross device design for users and the importance mobile technology plays in the role of seamless experiences.'
