Within Composer, you'll find everything you need to build a sophisticated conversational experience: a visual dialog editor, tools to train and manage Language Understanding (LU), language generation and templating systems, and a ready-to-use bot runtime executable.\n \nThis presentation will go over the different features of Composer and explore its connection to the Bot Framework SDK to model dialogs, input recognition, and response generation. Multiple scenarios of creating sophisticated Conversational Applications will be explored while demonstrating the latest and greatest features of the Bot Framework SDK.\n\nLearn More: \nCreate a new LUIS app https://aka.ms/LUISBuild2020\n\nThe AI Show's Favorite links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show   https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe\nCreate a Free account (Azure)  https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree"
