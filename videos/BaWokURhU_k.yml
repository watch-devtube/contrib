Learn about the latest rules of web development we've added, updated optimizations, go over a new refreshed UI, see how to collect data through beacons to track progress over time, cut and paste fixes, and how to work with 3rd party libraries more effectively, including Google Analytics. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
