description: "CF + Kubo: Choosing the Right Platform for the Job - Meaghan Kjelland, Google & Fred Melo, Pivotal\n\nThere’s a lot of excitement from the CloudFoundry (CF) community around Kubo - Pivotal’s and Google’s engineering project for Kubernetes (K8s) clusters managed by BOSH. While Kubo was just accepted as a CF Incubator project, there’s still a lot of confusion around CloudFoundry x Kubernetes use cases and best usage scenarios for services and cloud applications.\n\nThis session led by Pivotal and Google will introduce Kubo and compare it with Cloud Foundry - from use case and architecture perspectives. Attendees will learn what are the main differences between CF and Kubernetes, what kinds of workloads are most suitable for each, and how Kubo helps you combine them for a complete cloud native solution. The session will also feature a live demo using both CF and Kubernetes integrated as a single platform.\n\nAbout Meaghan Kjelland\nMeaghan is a Software Engineer at Google taking the steam out of proprietary software by building the future in open source. She is currently working with Pivotal and VMware to make Kubernetes' container orchestration strengths complement Cloud Foundry applications.\n\nAbout Fred Melo\nFred has been in the software industry for +15 years. Currently working as a Director of Product Management and Tech Marketing for Pivotal, his job is to help customers from all industries build business-relevant Big Data, Fast Data, Mobile and IoT solutions.
