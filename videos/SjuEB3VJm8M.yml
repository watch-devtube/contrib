title: 'YOW! 2013 Liz Keogh - Handling Uncertainty with Behavior-Driven Development'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513954514
description: "BDD is a set of practices which help software development teams to have conversations about the behavior of their system and how it delivers value to the project stakeholders. BDD has changed from its early roots as a replacement to TDD and now works as a mini-methodology across the whole software lifecycle. Over the last few years the adoption of BDD has grown globally, with dozens of tools created, used by hundreds of projects around the world.\n\nIn this talk we look at the original reasons behind the creation of BDD, bringing the focus back to the language and conversations which lie at its heart. We look at how BDD’s patterns can be applied at multiple scales – from the initial project vision all the way to the code – to deliberately discover and address uncertainty and risk in every aspect of software development, producing reliable, maintainable software that matters.\n\nLiz Keogh is an independent Lean and Agile consultant based in London. She is a well-known blogger and international speaker, a core member of the BDD community and a contributor to a number of open-source projects including JBehave.\n\nShe works with subjects as diverse as haiku poetry, complexity thinking, effective personal feedback and OO development, and has a strong technical background with almost 15 years’ experience in delivering and coaching others to deliver large-scale enterprise applications, which she now combines with a focus on psychology, NLP and adult learning. She has pioneered the application of learning models in measuring Agile maturity and coaching progress, and is currently interested in modelling risk and change with complexity thinking and the Cynefin framework. Liz was awarded the Gordon Pask award in 2010 for deepening existing ideas in the Agile space and “coming up with some pretty crazy ones of her own”. She is also a fantasy fiction writer and published poet.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
