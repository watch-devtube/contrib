description: "\"It is now 2020 and good DevOps practices are no longer just nice to have. It is absolutely necessary to continuously deliver value to our end users. Yet this isn't easy to do right. Unfortunately, all the flashy Hello World DevOps demos we see at conferences don’t really help us figure out how to do DevOps in the real world. They don’t even let us know what is possible.\n\nIn this session, we change all of that. We explore the why's and the how. Why is DevOps important? Why do we care? How do we implement DevOps best practices? And finally, we will do a real-world deep dive. \n\nStarting from nothing at all except source code (and I mean NOTHING. No infrastructure at all) we end with a complex modern application deployed all the way out into production hosted in the cloud.\n\nWe touch on modern technologies and techniques. From Infrastructure as Code to set up DNS. From the web, front ends to deploying databases. From APIs hosted in Kubernetes clusters all the way to mobile apps. And we do everything from within our pipelines. With the right tooling, anything is possible. And in this session, you will see all this happen live with DevOps best practices including IaC, Database DevOps, Security, Quality, and even disaster recovery!\""
