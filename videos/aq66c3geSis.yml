description: "Big Learning Workshop: Algorithms, Systems, and Tools for Learning at Scale at NIPS 2011 \r\n\r\nInvited Talk: Big Machine Learning made Easy by Miguel Araujo \r\n\r\nMiguel Araujo holds a B.S and M.S in computer science from Universidad Antonio de Nebrija and San Diego State University. He is a Machine Learning addict and an active open source hacker that enjoys coding in Python. Miguel is a contributor in open source projects like: django-rules, django-crispy-forms, and requests-oauth. \r\n\r\nAbstract: While machine learning has made its way into certain industrial applications, there are many important real-world domains, especially domains with large-scale data, that remain unexplored. There are a number of reasons for this, and they occur at all places in the technology stack."
