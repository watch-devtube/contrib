language: English
recordingDate: 1445387020
description: 'Scale changes everything. Number of connections and destinations went from dozen to thousands, number of messages increased by order of magnitude. What once was quite adequate for enterprise messaging can''t scale to support "Internet of Things". We need new protocols, patterns and architectures to support this new world. This session will start with basic introduction to the concept of Internet of things. Next it will discuss general technical challenges involved with the concept and explain why it is becoming mainstream now. Now we''re ready to start talking about solutions. We will introduce some messaging patterns (like telemetry and command/control) and protocols (such as MQTT and AMQP) used in these scenarios. Finally we will see how Apache ActiveMQ is gearing up for this race. We will show tips for horizontal and vertical scaling of the broker, related projects that can help with deployments and what the future development road map looks like.'
