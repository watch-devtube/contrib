description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMirko Presser - Research and Innovation for the Smart City Lab, Alexandra Institute\n\nABSTRACT\nWen Jiabao, the Former Premier of the People's Republic of China, provided the most poetic and, for me, complete picture of the Internet of Things -- the Internet + the Internet of Things = the Wisdom of the Earth.\n\nThe IoT is not a technology, not even a suite of technologies. Nor is it an application, idea or concept. It is all of them together and much more. It will define how we live, work and play -- it will shake up industries, governments and society as a whole. It is the biggest disruption hitting the planet since the printing press.\n\nFor many years we have built expert systems solving a problem (a business case) now we are starting to connect these expert systems to the Internet (vague business cases) and we are seeing new opportunities, challenges and risks. The talk I will be giving is about getting ready to embrace the chaos. There will be many technologies and platforms that will make up the Internet of Things. And there will be countless applications and services supported by it. The trick is to keep it connected enough and open enough to foster innovation.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
