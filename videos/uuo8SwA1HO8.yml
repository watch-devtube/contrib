description: "PyData LA 2018 \n\nHow can we estimate the impact of a historical event where there is no way to run a controlled experiment? For example, we may want to assess the impact of a TV campaign or account for lost sales during an outage. This talk presents a brief overview of interrupted time series analysis, a technique commonly used in econometrics and public health that is designed to address this type of problem.\n\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
