title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Thursday Keynote - Everyone Has Something to Share'
recordingDate: 1506590936
description: "Sharing is at the root of our community. We share code, knowledge, experiences, and sometimes even conflict—all in the interest of making Drupal better, our community stronger, and improving ourselves. But sharing is rarely easy to do. Competing forces like lack of time, imposter syndrome, and the lack of a safety net to fall back on can make it feel like we don't have anything worth contributing.\n\nI believe that everyone has something to share. And while I can't decide what that is for you, I can tell you how I figured it out and why you can too. Mine is a story about dealing with imposter syndrome, making new friends, embarrassing myself, being mentored, making mistakes, becoming a mentor, and figuring out that little ole' me really does have something to contribute. And that the benefits of doing so are enormous.\n\nIn this session I’ll\_reflect on 10 years of both successfully and unsuccessfully engaging with the community. By doing so I hope to help others learn about what they have to share, and the benefits of doing so. This is important because sharing:\n\nCreates diversity, both of thought and culture\nBuilds people up, helps them realize their potential, and enriches our community\nFosters connections, and makes you, as an individual, smarter\nCreates opportunities for yourself and others\nFeels all warm and fuzzy\nThis session is for anyone who is interested in learning about the benefits of sharing. And how doing so can lead to tangible outcomes and opportunities for growth both in your personal and professional life.\n\nNo matter what you do with Drupal you have something to share. And by doing so you make Drupal better, our community stronger, and yourself smarter."
