description: "Working for a company whose culture and growth emerges from a shared passion for open source, is my dream job and I am fortunate enough to do it at Bocoup.\n\nOpen source fuels engineers' professional and personal development as well as our client work. By doing so, we've created a sustainable environment that is driven by purpose. In this talk, I will share some of the principles we've adopted and how we managed to make it work. Most importantly, I'll explain why building a company with open source at heart is better for the team, the clients, and the open source community.\n\nIrene Ros\n\nBocoup\n\nIrene is a Senior Developer and Data Visualization Specialist at Bocoup. Most recently Irene has been working with the Guardian Interactive Team in the UK on the Miso Project, an open source toolkit designed to expedite the creation of high-quality interactive storytelling and data visualisation content.\n\nBefore Bocoup, Irene spent 3 years working at IBM Research's Visual Communication Lab as a data visualization research developer. Together with her team she helped build Many Eyes -- a collaborative data visualization creation and sharing tool and Many Bills -- a visual interface to reading congressional legislation. Her work has been written about in the New York Times and the New York Times Open Blog, as well as Fast Company."
