language: English
recordingDate: 1492507699
description: "We've all been there: debugging problems in a test case and silently screaming into the dark. (Sometimes not even silently.) Poor test case design can cost you significant time and effort let alone impact the quality of your application or product. Testing is vitally important, but so is having a test suite you can use effectively and can rely on. This session will take you through the top ten rules for writing effective and reliable testcases.\n\nThe new kids on the block such as Cloud or Docker and general \"Infrastructure as Code\" style solutions may make you believe old rules are just old. This talk will make you think again. Knowledge gained from personal experience is always best. Learn from these old masters how to design great test cases and maybe you'll never have to visit the dark side again.\n\nSteve Poole is an eclectic mix of DevOps practitioner, a long time IBM Java developer, leader and evangelist. (Not to mention a JavaOne Rockstar) He’s been working on IBM Java SDKs and JVMs since Java was less than one year old. He’s also had time to work on other things including representing IBM on various JSRs, being a committer on various open source projects including ones at Apache, Eclipse and OpenJDK. He’s also member of the Adopt OpenJDK group championing community involvement in OpenJDK. Steve is a seasoned speaker and regular presenter at JavaOne, JAX, Devoxx and other conferences on technical and software engineering topics.\n\nStuart Marks is a Principal Member of Technical Staff in the Java Platform Group at Oracle. He is currently working on a variety of JDK core libraries projects, including Collections, Lambda, and Streams, as well as improving test quality and performance. As his alter ego \"Dr Deprecator\" he also works on the Java SE deprecation mechanism. He has previously worked on JavaFX and Java ME at Sun Microsystems. He has over twenty years of software platform product development experience in the areas of window systems, interactive graphics, and mobile and embedded systems. Stuart holds a Master's degree in Computer Science and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University."
