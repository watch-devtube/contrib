description: "Speaker: Mike Mazur (BBM)\n\nWriting tests before writing the code is slow. Pair programming is two engineers doing a single engineer’s work. Continuous deployment is a lot of work, just copy the JAR file to the production server and restart it.\n\nMike will dispel those myths and walk you through how extreme programming practices help your team reliably ship high-quality software at a steady pace – and sustain that pace in the long run. The technology industry is competitive, and teams which can iterate quickly to a valuable product will persevere.\n\nMike has been fortunate to have started his career with a small, agile team more than 10 years ago. Since then he has been living agile and extreme programming practices. He spent 6 years at Pivotal Labs/Neo, working with companies on their products and teaching engineering teams extreme programming practices. He is now running the engineering team at BBM Singapore where extreme programming is simply how they work."
