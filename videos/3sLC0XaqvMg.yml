description: "In the past two years, smart speakers have become the most popular IoT device, Amazon_ Google and Apple have introduced their own smart speaker products. Most of these smart speakers have natural language recognition, chat, music playback, IoT device control, shopping, and so on. Manufacturers use artificial intelligence technology to make smart speakers have similar human capabilities in the chat conversation. However, with the smart speakers coming into more and more homes, and the function is becoming more powerful, its security has been questioned by many people. People are worried that smart speakers will be hacked to leak their privacy, and our research proves that this concern is very necessary.\n\nIn this talk, we will present how to use multiple vulnerabilities to achieve remote attack some of the most popular smart speakers. Our final attack effects include silent listening, control speaker speaking content and other demonstrations. And we're also going to talk about how to extract firmware from BGA packages Flash chips such as EMMC, EMCP, NAND Flash, etc. In addition, it contains how to turn on debug interfaces and get root privileges by modifying firmware content and Re-soldering Flash chips, which can be of great help for subsequent vulnerability analysis and debugging. Finally, we will play several demo videos to demonstrate how we can remotely access some Smart Speaker Root permissions and use smart speakers for eavesdropping and playing voice."
