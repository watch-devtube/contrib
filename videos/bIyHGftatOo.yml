He has used Erlang on a daily basis since 1995, starting as an intern at Ericsson’s computer science laboratory, the birthplace of Erlang. Francesco moved on to Ericsson’s Erlang training and consulting arm, working on the first release of the OTP middleware, which he applied to turnkey solutions and flagship telecom applications. In 1999, soon after Erlang was released as open source, he founded Erlang Solutions. With offices in three countries, they have become the world leaders in Erlang-based support, consulting, training, certification, systems development, and conferences. Francesco has worked in major Erlang-based projects both within and outside Ericsson; and as technical director at Erlang Solutions has led the development and consulting teams. He is the co-author of Erlang Programming, recently published by O’Reilly.
