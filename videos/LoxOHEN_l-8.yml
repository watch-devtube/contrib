title: 'Being a generalist developer - Lital Hassine (Hebrew)'
recordingDate: 1546423888
description: "As a developer, do you want to be a generalist or specialist? The answer is not the same for everyone. It depends on your traits, the company you work for and even how long you are a software engineer. Being a generalist does not fit everyone but if it fits you, it can open up great opportunities and exciting career growth - anyhow, you're in for a hell of a ride.\n\nIf you are considering being a generalist this is the talk for you.\n\nLital Hassine has been solving problems with technology for over 15 years. In the past couple of years she is working on most of JoyTunes’ technology stack to give users an awesome learning experience while enjoying music. Lital is a true generalist - covering technologies from mobile development (iOS and Android), web development (js), backend (node.js, php, python) and some BI dev and marketing automation. Loves peaches and is learning to play the piano."
