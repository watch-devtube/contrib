title: 'GopherCon 2018: Anthony Starks - Go for Information Displays'
language: English
recordingDate: 1536936362
description: 'Informations displays are everywhere! Go is usually considered as a language for building back-end systems, but it is also suited for "programming pictures" -- turning data into compelling displays and visualizations. Anthony will explore this topic using three tools: SVGo, OpenVG library, and dec, with examples from sports, Go developer data, IT diagrams, flyers, stock data, persona views, time/weather/news, and general charting. Anthony will also introduce the notion of the "universal canvas" (ucan), as the framework for building information displays and visualizations.'
