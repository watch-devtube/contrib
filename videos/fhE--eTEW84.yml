This talk explains how to go from detecting to actually fixing memory leaks. OutOfMemoryError: it'll soon be just a bad memory!\n\nAndroid baker at Square.\n\nI started having fun with Java & Android as a consultant in Paris, then joined a startup in Barcelona and finally joined Square in San Francisco to work with some of the best engineers in the world.\n\nI like good wine & low entropy code."
