description: "Ryan Boyd introduces the Google Cloud Platform at the 2013 Game Developers Conference.  Provides a high level overview of Google App Engine, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage and BigQuery.  These technologies allow you to launch an app without system administrators, while having the ultimate flexibility of root on a virtual machine. Get high performance asset hosting, and analyze terabyte-sized data to optimize games. \n\nMomchil Kyurkchiev and Andrew First from Leanplum then talk about how they made a platform to help mobile app developers do A/B testing to optimize their apps.  They step through various components of Leanplum and talk about their underlying design decisions."
