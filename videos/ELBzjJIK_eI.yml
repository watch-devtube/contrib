description: "What do Cold War era nuclear isolation gloveboxes have to do with today's data science? It turns out potentially a lot!\n\nVery similar to nuclear engineers of the Cold War, Data Scientists often have access to very sensitive material (data). Today's data scientists need a way to interact with toxic data where spilling more than a few data could be destructive to a company. Securing compute clusters to be like nuclear glove boxes of old is one technique to limit data exfiltration and ensure data production is regularized, reliable and secure.\n\nThis talk will cover the philosophy and implementation of:\n\n- Data Dropbox - data goes in blindly but can be verified via checksums\n- Data Glovebox - one can manipulate data as desired but can not exfiltrate except via very specific, controlled processes\n\nClay Baenziger"
