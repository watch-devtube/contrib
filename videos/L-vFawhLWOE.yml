description: "The Actor Model has interesting properties that could be used for dealing with complexities posed by modern embedded systems. Using actors as compositional units to describe these systems is a new proposal which stands out and challenges conventional approaches.\n \nThis talk will demonstrate how, creating a layered architecture for hardware modules and partitioning up complex systems in smaller units, testing becomes much easier, runtime errors are contained, and the architecture becomes maintainable.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiked the song?
