description: "When we work alone, it’s easy to make sure things come out the way we think is best. But what happens when we need to get an entire team to agree on — and actually _use_ — best practices? What if we have to convince an entire _company_?\n\nIn this talk, we’ll learn how IBM is working to get huge, distributed teams to not only agree on a set of best practices but to actually follow them, leading to:\n\n* Improved developer experience and engagement\n* Increased velocity\n* Decreased technical debt\n* Higher reliability\n* Broad adoption of best practices\nand many more improvements in team cohesion and quality\nLearn battle-tested strategies and techniques that will benefit companies of any size, helping create teams that are more engaged, more effective, and more cohesive."
