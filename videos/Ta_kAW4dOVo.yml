title: 'SHIELD: Protecting CF, Services and Applications Through Backups and Restores'
language: English
recordingDate: 1475944707
description: "SHIELD is a modularized backup and restore solution which utilizes a plugin based architecture to backup and restore BOSH deployments. \n\nIn this talk, we will mainly focus on how to use SHIELD to assist with our Backup and Restore plan for Cloud Foundry applications and Services which are deployed by BOSH. More specifically, we will show you how to use SHIELD to backup and restore core Cloud Foundry internal services as well as non-core CF services such as Redis, PostgreSQL, MySQL, RabbitMQ, etc.. and how applications can be backed up and restored by adding plugins without having to modify SHIELD core. \n\nWe will also show you the framework of SHIELD which itself is distributed as a BOSH release. It consists of a core daemon, backup target plugins, storage plugins, a CLI and a web UI. The core daemon manages meta data, scheduling, tasks and jobs, it also monitors and verifies the status of backup jobs and archives. Backup target plugins specify what is to be backed up and how it is done. Store plugins specify where (local filesystem, or blobstores such as S3, Swift, Atmos, etc.) backups can be stored and how to put them there and retrieve them back. The CLI is used for controlling all aspects of the system, such as backing up, restoring, setting retention policies, scheduling, job & task management, etc.\n\nXiujiao Gao\nXiujiao Gao is currently pursuing her Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at the State University of New York at Buffalo (UB).
