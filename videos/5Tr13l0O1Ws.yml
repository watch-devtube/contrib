description: "Is blockchain + AI a winning combo? Yes! They are complementary technologies, and knowing how both work will make you a much more powerful developer. Artificial Intelligence can use the power of the blockchain to audit data, add incentives to its goals, and even create new types of meritocratic organizations. In this video, i'll talk about how they can both work together, code out the proof of work algorithm in python, then talk about a few other consensus algorithms at a high level. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/blockchain_consensus\n\nPlease Subscribe!
