title: 'YOW! 2012 Michael T. Nygard - Architecture Without an End State'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513432836
description: "You've seen them. You've probably made one: The architecture vision diagrams. The block diagrams, the message bus topologies... How many of these diagrams ever actually get built?\n\nWe never really finish constructing one of these grand visions before something interferes. Maybe it's a merger or acquisition. Maybe your company has a \"regime change\". (After all, the average tenure of a CIO is down to 18 months!)\n\nThe \"end state\" vision never gets built. Instead, we need to focus on how to flex and change, incorporating new technology, new principles, new business models, and even the last generation's legacy. Call it agile architecture, or meta-architecture, or \"how I learned to love laminated stucco.\" It's architecture without an end state.\n\nMichael Nygard strives to raise the bar and ease the pain for developers across the country. Highly-available, highly-scalable commerce systems are his forte. Michael has written and co-authored several books, including \"97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know\" and the best seller \"Release It!\", a book about building software that survives the real world.\n\nFor more on YOW!
