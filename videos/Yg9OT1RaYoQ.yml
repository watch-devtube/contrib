description: "With the rise of web-to-native cross-platform solutions like React Native and Electron we got to witness not only their potential but also their shortcomings. Thanks to WebAssembly we now have an alternative that uses a different approach but promises the same results.\n\nIn my talk, I’ll share the lessons the join.me team learned over the last few years while creating and maintaining a cross-platform (web included!) C++ codebase, with special attention to management and team-dynamic aspects. You’ll also see how WebAssembly changes the game and, through a bit of live-coding, how easy it is to get started with it."
