title: 'When Agile Doesn''t Work Anymore: Managing a Large Documentation Project'
recordingDate: 1548272154
description: "Lana Brindley\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/225/\n\nWe all age. Some more gracefully than others. Our documentation ages, too, and sadly it's not always glamorous. Docs that start out as a thing of sartorial elegance can, many years and patches later, become tired and sad and badly in need of retirement. Sometimes the content is so out of date and incorrect, the format so anachronistic that it needs to be consigned to a recycling bin. But not all documentation should be euthanised. Sometimes, it just needs a face lift.\r\n\r\nAgile documentation is, by its very nature, piecemeal, which can make it difficult to maintain a large documentation suite, and almost impossible to perform a large project that requires meticulous planning and extensive testing. In this talk I'll cover situations that require a complete documentation overhaul, how to go about planning for and undertaking such a project, and (perhaps most importantly) how to sell a Waterfall-style project to your Agile Product Owner.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
