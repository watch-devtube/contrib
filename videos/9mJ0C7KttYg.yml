description: "Further information and slides: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/18/session/scalable-ocr-pipelines-using-python-tensorflow-and-tesseract\n\nSession abstract: \nIn this talk we make a trip through the world of text recognition with free software and go step by step through the individual sections of a flexible and scalable OCR application. In a live demo you will be shown how Tesseract is used for text recognition and how the quality can be significantly improved doing a little pre-processing with openCV. Subsequently the documents are stored and indexed in Elasticsearch to allow full text search. All this with just a few lines of code and all in the sense of interactive programming with Jupyter.\n\nAgenda\n\n- Quirks and pitfalls in text recognition of scanned documents\n- Potential of pre-processing with openCV\n- Use Tesseract at scale\n- Quantify, compare and revaluate results\n- Use of Tensorflow in a production-ready application"
