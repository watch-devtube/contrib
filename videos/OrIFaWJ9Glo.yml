description: "In the old days, when websites were steam powered and exploded regularly, the web was simple, but slow. As it evolved it became more powerful, but harder on servers and clients alike.\n\nToday, we have the Single Page Application. Most web apps are now in the browsers themselves, and the web is becoming fluid, comfortable, and accessible from any device.\n\nIn this talk from HTML5 Dev Conf 3, Josh Powell and Mike Mikowski of snaplogic, teach you their SPA design approach, and then start exploring new techniques like structured JavaScript and responsive design. They also cover server-side JavaScript, NoSQL data stores, and new JavaScript frameworks.\n\nSlides can be viewed here: http://html5devconf.com/archives/october2012/slides/Michael-S-Mikowski-Tuesday-2012-10-16-js4spa.pdf\n\n** More videos on HTML5 development at http://marakana.com/s/"
