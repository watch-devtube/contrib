title: 'USENIX ATC ''19 - Multi-Queue Fair Queuing'

description: "Mohammad Hedayati, University of Rochester; Kai Shen, Google; Michael L. Scott, University of Rochester; Mike Marty, Google\n\nModern high-speed devices (e.g., network adapters, storage, accelerators) use new host interfaces, which expose multiple software queues directly to the device. These multi-queue interfaces allow mutually distrusting applications to access the device without any cross-core interaction, enabling throughput in the order of millions of IOP/s on multicore systems. Unfortunately, while independent device access is scalable, it also introduces a new problem: unfairness. Mechanisms that were used to provide fairness for older devices are no longer tenable in the wake of multi-queue design, and straightforward attempts to re-introduce it would require cross-core synchronization that undermines the scalability for which multiple queues were designed.\n\nTo address these challenges, we present Multi-Queue Fair Queueing (MQFQ), the first fair, work-conserving scheduler suitable for multi-queue systems. Specifically, we (1) reformulate a classical fair queueing algorithm to accommodate multi-queue designs, and (2) describe a scalable implementation that bounds potential unfairness while minimizing synchronization overhead. Our implementation of MQFQ in Linux 4.15 demonstrates both fairness and high throughput. Evaluation with an NVMe over RDMA fabric (NVMf) device shows that MQFQ can reach up to 3.1 Million IOP/s on a single machine — 20x higher than the state-of-the-art Linux Budget Fair Queueing. Compared to a system with no fairness, MQFQ reduces the slowdown caused by an antagonist from 3.78x to 1.33x for the FlashX workload and from 6.57x to 1x for the Aerospike workload (2x is considered \"fair\" slowdown).\n\nView the full USENIX ATC '19 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc19/technical-sessions"
