description: "RubyConf 2018 - Building web-based board games only with Ruby by Yoh Osaki\n\nThis talk explains how to build web-based board games without JavaScript but only with Ruby. Web programmers are forced to write front-end code using JavaScript. And interaction with the client-side and server-side grows increasingly complex. Board game which has rich UI and communicate in real-time is one of the applications which needs such requirements.\n\nOpal is a compiler converts from Ruby to JavaScript. I created some gems for Opal as follow as.\n\nVirtual DOM\nIsomorphic web programming framework\ndRuby implementation on browser\nI show you a web- board game demonstration using these gems."
