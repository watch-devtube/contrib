description: "Slides: https://speakerdeck.com/espylaub/i-have-a-dreamcode-build-apps-not-backends-jsconf-dot-eu-2013\nThe way frontend coders work with data is still very much determined by historical technical necessities and sentiments instead of by how they would like to work. We're proposing a friendlier, more frontend-centered approach to building data-driven applications, where the backend adapts to the frontend developer's dream code. At the end of this lies the wish many frontend devs have: \"I wish I wouldn't have to worry about the backend anymore.\" Well, your time is coming.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/alex-feyerke-i-have-a-dreamcode-build-apps-not-backends.html\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
