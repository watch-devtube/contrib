description: 'Serverless brings you on the right path to adopt microservices. But the distinction between technologies and processes should not be underestimated, and common pitfalls are still there, ready to slow down your development with the risk of creating a "distributed monolith". In this session, we’ll see how to build scalable projects, developed by small, agile teams on top of tools such as AWS Lambda and the Amazon API Gateway. We’ll look for tools beyond just functions, understanding the importance of architecture design and system integration, to support a continuous deployment strategy.'
