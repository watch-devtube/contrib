What started as hobbies and hackathon projects have evolved into sustainable businesses that serve millions of users around the globe. These tools rely on open data about our societies, governments and physical world, but transform it and make it useful.\nOur partner developers around the globe are making people safer and reinvigorating democracies with technology. This presentation will explore the motivations, technologies and challenges behind Google's work with these partners, as well as share what we've learned about how anyone can use their unique skills to make a difference.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
