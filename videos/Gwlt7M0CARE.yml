description: "Intro + Deep Dive: Windows SIG - Michael Michael, VMware & Patrick Lang, Microsoft \n\nThe chairs for SIG-Windows will provide an update on the efforts to bring Windows to Kubernetes. This will concentrate on presenting new features that are being delivered and the General Availability of Windows Containers on Kubernetes. We will also have a detailed discussion on our future roadmap, key functionality that we want to enable, and open the floor for Q&A with customers and members of the SIG-Windows community. This is both an introduction to Windows on Kubernetes and a deep dive into the efforts of the team. Some familiarity with Windows on Kubernetes is required for the deep dive part since we will have an in-depth discussion on key features that are in the pipeline for Windows, explain their implementation and have a discussion on tradeoffs with the community. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPlM"
