description: "Filmed in Barcelona at ElixirConf.EU 2017\n\nIt is the story of the birth of a quadcopter built using a 3D printer, a Raspberry Pi 3 and some Elixir magic. I will begin from the genesis of the project up to a flying drone. Expect some code, some hardware and some 3D printing time-lapse.\n\nElixirConf.EU is a community conference created to promote education, networking and collaboration within the Elixir/Erlang/Ruby communities."
