language: ""
recordingDate: 1513269101
description: "Spring Framework 5.0 is the first generation of the core framework explicitly targeting JDK 8 as well as JDK 9, fully embracing Java 8 at all levels and allowing a smooth early-adopter upgrade to Java 9. This talk illustrates the benefits of a JDK 8 baseline and the general compatibility challenges for frameworks on JDK 9, with lessons learned from Spring Framework 5.0's development. It provides concrete advice for upgrading Spring applications to JDK 9, on the classpath as well as on the module path (Jigsaw), highlighting the benefits and the tradeoffs involved.\n\nJuergen Hoeller, Spring Framework Lead, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
