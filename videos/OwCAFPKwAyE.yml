title: 'Matt S. Trout - "ES6: Almost An Acceptable Perl5"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1498019604
description: "If you haven't been paying attention to javascript (and I can entirely understand why you might prefer not to), things have changed quite amazingly over the last few years.\n\nOk, they got 'use strict' years ago - but now they've added 'let', which is basically 'my', anonymous function declaration syntax that won't give you RSI, a class keyword, and more.\n\nPlus annotations now let you make all sorts of trouble, and the tooling to transpile to Olde JS is mostly comprehensible and no longer replaced by something completely different every two weeks.\n\nSo, clearly, the only sensible thing to do was to try and write ES6 in the same style I write perl5, and see how far I managed to get.\n\nCome to this talk and you'll find out.\n\n\nMatt S Trout was thrust into Perl at the tender age of seventeen by a backup accident. Two weeks later he realised that he was in love with the language and has been happily using it for systems automation, network, web and database development ever since.\n\nHe is co-maintainer of the Catalyst web framework (and co-author of The Definitive Guide to Catalyst), the creator of the DBIx::Class ORM, and a core team member for the Moose metaprotocol and object system, as well as contributing to assorted other CPAN projects.\n\nMatt spends his days leading the technical team at Shadowcat Systems Limited, an open source consultancy specialising in Catalyst, Perl applications deployment and systems architecture. Shadowcat sponsors web, source repository and mailing list hosting for Catalyst, DBIx::Class and a large number of associated projects, and creates and releases open source code both internally and on behalf of its clients."
