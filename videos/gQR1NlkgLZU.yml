Just like city-wide fires used to be taken as a fact of life in urban living. The key to no longer burning cities to the ground was fire prevention, not improved fire fighting. I've applied similar thinking with dozens of teams and shifted to a world in which bugs occur at the same frequency as city-wide fires.\nLet's imagine this world for a moment. These teams don't have:\n\na bug database. They just use a section of the whiteboard.\nlots of testers.\nlarge suites of automated tests. Lots of their code is untested and known bug-free (yes, that is possible).\nbug triage meetings.\nlarge customer support teams or devs handling escalations.\nproblems in operations or large ops teams.\nstory \"done-done\" criteria or delays in shipping.\ncomplex trade-offs in prioritizing stories against each other.\nlost revenue due to market embarrassment.\nIt turns out that most software development activities arise from one source: bugs. They are failure demand, and thus 100% waste. Teams that stop writing bugs get to stop doing these rituals. They spend a lot more time on value delivery and reduce costs across the organization.\nIn this talk, I'll show how these teams have stopped writing bugs. We'll discuss the source of bugs and I'll show you how to code differently so that bugs just...don't happen.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nArlo helps you change cultures in large organizations. He transitions hundreds or thousands of people at a time to full technical and cultural prowess in a way that sticks.\n\nMore importantly, Arlo gives your company the ability to change its own culture. He seeks to be the last consultant you will ever need to hire. After 6 months, you should be able to adapt your culture, practices, and company structures to meet novel challenges, each in a matter of days.\n\nArlo tries stuff in the real world. Some of it works. Some doesn't. Then he talks about what he tried. He knows the theory, but only cares about the practical outcomes.\n\nHe's also got this thing with names. His innovations include Naked Planning, Promiscuous Pairing, and Drunken Estimation. Oh, and he's Bloody Stupid from time to time.\n\nFor a good time, chat him up in a hall, a bar, or online.\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.agilesingapore.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/XvTJ/"
