description: "http://2017.jsconf.eu/speakers/alexander-pope-outbreak-indexsw9a4c43b4b4778e7d1ca619eaaf5ac1dbjs.html\n\nAugust 30, 2016, was by all accounts an average Tuesday, and release number 523 just a simple re-factor, but something went horribly wrong that day: bad code escaped from the office, and it quickly spread to infect tens of thousands, giving rise to a hoard of zombie ServiceWorkers!\n\nThis is a disaster about a typo. This is a thriller about technology out of control. This is a tragedy about wasted CPU cycles. This is a cautionary tale about living in the age of ServiceWorker."
