description: "Sebastian Kirsch, Google Switzerland GmbH\n\nGoogle SRE has developed a special interview format called \"Non-Abstract Large Systems Design\" or NALSD. The focus of this interview is developing a credible approach for solving a specific problem at large scale. Going beyond coding and algorithm skills, candidates demonstrate their skills in designing for scalability, reliability and robustness, estimating provisioning needs, and managing change. All candidates for SRE positions at Google participate in one NALSD interview as part of their recruiting process.\n\nAttendees will learn why Google has developed this interview format and which aspects of a candidate's skill set are covered in the format. They will see an example of this interview type, and learn how to come up with their own interview questions. Tips and tricks derived from practical experience in conducting this interview type will help attendees avoid common pitfalls when interviewing candidates.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Asia/Australia Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
