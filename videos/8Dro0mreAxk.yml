language: English
recordingDate: 1538096767
description: "Liz Fong-Jones, Google, and Emily Gorcenski\n\nOur job as engineers does not stop purely with adherence to Service Level Objectives. A service that does a reliable job of harming people, exacerbating injustices, or excluding marginalized groups is not at all a service worth building and maintaining. Technology is poised to change the world, for good or for ill, and engineers of all kinds share a responsibility to ensure that their work is \"for the public good.\" We can apply SRE practices to advocate for justice in the products we build and in the broader industries we work in.\n\nAttendees will learn about the parallels between SRE and social activism movements, and how they can advocate for changing their workplaces and the world.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
