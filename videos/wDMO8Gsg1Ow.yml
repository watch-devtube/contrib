description: 'Have you ever used an open source project? Of course you have, but have you made any contributions yourself? Filed a bug report? Submitted a patch? Have you ever started your own OSS project, or taken a closed/private project public? What licenses should you use? How do you manage contributions? How do you support contributors and still get work done? What do you do with difficult community members? In this talk we''ll go over the basics of OSS: how to get involved, how to start a project, how to manage contributions. We''ll discuss project lifecycles, legal CYA tips, and how to keep projects moving. You''ll see the inner workings of real OSS projects, and learn how to be a better OSS user and producer.'
