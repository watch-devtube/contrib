description: "Google Tech Talks\nOctober 27, 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nSource code versioning is an invaluable tool for software development:\n\n- users can easily track the newest versions,\n- maintainers can easily track down which commit introduced a bug (often\n making it easier to come up with a fix),\n- new developers get more documentation than just a big chunk of source\n code,\n- etc\n\nIn my talk I want to stress the importance of source code versioning in a related context: when contributing changes to an Open Source project, which is typically a moving target, it can take a few revisions of the patches until they are accepted. I present several scenarios and workflows, and describe how Git can help with them.\n\nSpeaker: Johannes Schindelin\nJohannes studied mathematics with a strong bias to number theory, trying to stay away from applied science as far as possible. Failing, he went on to a software company, where he gave up after finding that code quality played a lower role than pure politics. So he went back to university (Wuerzburg, Germany) to get a PhD in neurogenetics, and after a brief stint at psychology (St Andrews, UK) he now works on image processing (MPI Dresden, Germany)."
