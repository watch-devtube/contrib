title: 'YOW! Connected 2015 - Chris van Raay - Bridging the Designer – Developer Divide'
recordingDate: 1446859436
description: "The goal of this talk is to provide attendees with practical advice that can help app designers and developers work together more effectively. It draws on the experience Chris has gained through 4 years at Deloitte Digital, leading both design and/or engineering for prominent Australian clients including Australia Post, ING Direct, Telstra, The Victorian and Federal Governments.\n\nAt the heart of the discussion is the fact that designer’s goal of UI consistency and the developer’s goal of cleanly architected code are not opposing desires, but in fact the same goal spoken in a different language. The talk will include both general advice about how teams can work together more effectively and also very tangible recommendations for structuring design deliverables and UI code.\n\nChris is an experienced interaction designer and software developer specialising in iOS apps. Through his senior position at Deloitte Digital he led projects on some of Australia’s most industry-recognised apps for clients including Australia Post, ING Direct, Telstra, The Victorian and Federal Governments. He is now a Lead Interaction Designer at ANZ and also has his own software business Anatomize Pty Ltd, through which he both consults and sells a number of apps. He’s also a big fan of MBAAS solutions and has created the only mac data browser for Facebook’s Parse platform.\n\nFor more on YOW! Connected, visit http://connected.yowconference.com.au"
