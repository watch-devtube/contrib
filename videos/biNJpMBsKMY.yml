description: "Russ talks about his experiences within teams as they attempt to embrace change and find, to their dismay, that their software itself can't keep up. Diving through technical solutions and patterns, Russ will show you how to avoid building software that can't keep up with the pace of change that was always the promise of agility.\n\nAbout Russ\n\nRuss Miles is Principal Consultant at Simplicity Itself where he works with his clients to help deliver simple and valuable software and change.\nRuss' experience covers almost every facet of software delivery having worked across many different domains including Financial Services, Publishing, Defence, Insurance and Search. With over 16 years experience of consultancy, coaching and training, Russ helps to change all facets of the software delivery process in order to remove unnecessary and costly complexity in everything from developer skills and practices, through applying the right processes for the job at hand, to ensuring that the right change is delivered, be it through software or otherwise.\n\nAbout Agile Adria conference\n(agileadria.com)\n\nThis video is recorded at Agile Adria conference.
