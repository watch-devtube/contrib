For the diversity of Kubernetes ecosystem, we should also think about how we should get the new shape of containers integrated with all other high-level container runtimes, such as cri-o or rktlet. Firecracker, an open-source project published by Amazon, opens up a lot of interesting perspective to the container ecosystem. It opens up use cases between containers and VMs, making use of KVM without relying on heavyweight Qemu instances. Though its integration with the\nKubernetes ecosystem has only started its first step, only with containerd. For the diversity of Kubernetes ecosystem, we should also think about how we should get the new shape of containers integrated with all other high-level container runtimes, such as cri-o or rktlet. \n\nIn this talk, I would like to talk about alternative ways of integration for getting firecracker integrated with multiple container runtimes. A proof-of-concept for the concept can be also presented during the talk. \n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 11:05:00+01"
