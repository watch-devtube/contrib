description: "What would you do if you had to write a Java program that solves a 10 x 10 maze with a robot in 64 MB of RAM (not gigabytes) and not have it pause? This session’s speakers faced a similar situation while writing a path finding algorithm on a Lego Mindstorms EV3. The EV3 comes with only 64 MB of RAM with a microprocessor. After finding a creative solution, they realized that some commonly faced problems as well as some complex algorithms can be solved within these memory constraints. In this session, they program a Lego Mindstorms EV3 with Java and use the robot, as well as a few other fun contraptions, to demonstrate solutions to common developer problems. They also integrate a Raspberry Pi with the Twitter API. The session is designed to be fun and creative.\n\nNikhil Nanivadekar is a contributor to Eclipse Collections as well as GS Collections. He graduated from University of Utah with a Masters in Mechanical Engineering in 2012 and joined Goldman Sachs upon graduation. He is a fourth-year engineer in Private Wealth Management Technology.\n\nLuke Torjussen is a Vice President at Goldman Sachs working on 'Marcus: by Goldman Sachs'. He Graduated from the University of Manchester, UK with a BSc in Computer Science in 2012. He joined Goldman Sachs upon Graduation."
