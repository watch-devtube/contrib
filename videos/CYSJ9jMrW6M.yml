description: "by Jan Verschelde\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.120/python_solving_polynomial_systems.webm\n\n\nPHCpack is a software package for solving polynomial systems\nwith homotopy continuation.  The talk will tell the story of\nthe development of phcpy, a scripting interface for PHCpack,\nwhich has been under development for the past five years.\nOne result is the availability of the software in a Python2,\nPython3, and SageMath kernel of JupyterHub, which runs at\nhttps://pascal.math.uic.edu/hub/login (www.phcpack.org). \n\nOther relevant details:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0056 (EuroSciPy 2013 proceedings paper)\nhttp://homepages.math.uic.edu/~jan/phcpydochtml/index.html (documentation)\nhttps://github.com/janverschelde/PHCpack (github repository) PHCpack is a software package for solving polynomial systems\nwith homotopy continuation.  The talk will tell the story of\nthe development of phcpy, a scripting interface for PHCpack,\nwhich has been under development for the past five years.\nWorking on phcpy involved the following activities:\n(1) Accessing code in a shared object file from Python.\n(2) Documenting the code with Sphinx.\n(3) CGI processing, managing user information and user data.\n(4) Making the code available online with JupyterHub.\nThe presentation will provide examples of the expertise\nacquired for the four tasks mentioned above. \n\nRoom: UD2.120 (Chavanne)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 16:30:00+01"
