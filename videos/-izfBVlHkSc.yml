description: "In this talk, I will show the audience how to build and deploy serverless AI-powered applications on AWS. In particular, two demos will be analysed in depths. The first demo is a simple mobile web app that allows a user to upload or take a picture with their mobile phone. The result is then spoken out loud using Amazon Polly. This demo is deployed using the AWS CLI (command line interface) with scripting techniques. The second demo is a podcast generator which connects to any RSS feed and converts that feed into a podcast. The result can then be played on iTunes or any podcast player. This demo uses AWS Lambda and Amazon Polly and is deployed using the Serverless framework.\n\nI will walk through the architecture, the APIs, the code itself and the deployment of those two applications using Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Polly, AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, Amazon Route53, Elasticsearch, and more.\n\n# Adrian Hornsby\nI am Technical Evangelist with AWS - Coding, Speaking, having fun :-)"
