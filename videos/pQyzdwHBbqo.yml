description: "A lot of times, research papers don't have an associated codebase that you can browse and run yourself. In cases like that, you'll have to code up the paper yourself. That is easier said than done, and in this video i'll show you how you should read and dissect a research paper so you can quickly implement it programmatically. The paper we'll be implementing in this video is called Neural Style transfer, that applies artistic filters to an image using 3 loss functions. Its a great starting point, i'll demo it using code, animations, and math. Enjoy!\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Research_to_Code\n\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
