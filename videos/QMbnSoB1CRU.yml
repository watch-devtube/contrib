description: "** Python Certification Training: https://www.edureka.co/python **\nThis Edureka video on Installing Python on Windows Tutorial covers all the aspects of installing and setting up Python to write code in. It is pretty simple and straightforward to setup Python completely in Windows as shown.\nFollowing topics are covered in this video:\n00:32 Agenda\n00:50 Introduction to Python\n01:16 Popularity of Python\n02:13 Why should you learn Python?\n03:31 Installing Python\n08:24 Python Development Environments\n09:51 Conclusion\n\nPython Tutorial Playlist: https://goo.gl/WsBpKe\nBlog Series: http://bit.ly/2sqmP4s\n\n#edureka #edurekaPython #InstallingPythonWindows #Edureka\n\nDo subscribe to our channel and hit the bell icon to never miss an update from us in the future: https://goo.gl/6ohpTV \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/edureka_learning\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n---------------- \n\n\nHow it Works?\n1. This is a 5 Week Instructor-led Online Course,40 hours of assignment and 20 hours of project work\n2. We have a 24x7 One-on-One LIVE Technical Support to help you with any problems you might face or any \n\nclarifications you may require during the course.\n3. At the end of the training, you will be working on a real-time project for which we will provide you a Grade and \n\na Verifiable Certificate!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAbout the Course\n\nEdureka’s Machine Learning Course using Python is designed to make you grab the concepts of Machine Learning. The \n\nMachine Learning training will provide a deep understanding of Machine Learning and its mechanism. As a Data \n\nScientist, you will be learning the importance of Machine Learning and its implementation in Python programming \n\nlanguage. Furthermore, you will be taught Reinforcement Learning which in turn is an important aspect of Artificial \n\nIntelligence. You will be able to automate real-life scenarios using Machine Learning Algorithms. Towards the end \n\nof the course, we will be discussing various practical use cases of Machine Learning in Python programming language \n\nto enhance your learning experience.\n\nAfter completing this Machine Learning Certification Training using Python, you should be able to:\nGain insight into the 'Roles' played by a Machine Learning Engineer\nAutomate data analysis using python\nDescribe Machine Learning\nWork with real-time data\nLearn tools and techniques for predictive modeling\nDiscuss Machine Learning algorithms and their implementation\nValidate Machine Learning algorithms\nExplain Time Series and it’s related concepts\nGain expertise to handle business in the future, living the present\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nWhy learn Machine Learning with Python?\n\nData Science is a set of techniques that enable the computers to learn the desired behavior from data without \n\nexplicitly being programmed. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of \n\nmathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science. This course exposes you to different classes of \n\nmachine learning algorithms like supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement algorithms. This course imparts you the \n\nnecessary skills like data pre-processing, dimensional reduction, model evaluation and also exposes you to \n\ndifferent machine learning algorithms like regression, clustering, decision trees, random forest, Naive Bayes and \n\nQ-Learning.\n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free)."
