description: "An introduction to data modeling for scalable web applications using Google App Engine, Python, and the ndb library. This talk covers features of the App Engine datastore and how to use them from ndb, including creating and manipulating entities, performing pre-indexed queries, and enforcing data integrity with transactions. It also introduces features of ndb for implementing structured data, and managing application performance with memcache, asynchronous API calls, and tasklets. Some familiarity with App Engine and Python are recommended, though no previous experience with ndb is needed.\n\nAbout Dan Sanderson\n\nDan Sanderson is a technical writer and software engineer at Google, Inc.
