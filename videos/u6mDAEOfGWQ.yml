description: "Design has branched out in new directions, galvanizing young practitioners, sparking novel business models, and attracting worldwide attention. A designer today can choose to focus on interaction, interfaces, the web, visualization, socially minded infrastructures, immersive spaces, biodesign, sustainability, video games, critical scenarios, and, yes, even products and furniture.\n\nAbout Paola Antonelli (Museum of Modern Art, New York):\nPaola Antonelli's work investigates design's influence on everyday experience, often including overlooked objects and practices, and combining design, architecture, art, science and technology. In addition to her role as Senior Curator of Architecture and Design at MoMA, Paola was appointed director of a new Research and Development initiative in 2012. She lectures frequently at high-level global conferences and coordinates cultural discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos. A true interdisciplinary, energetic and generous cultural thinker, Paola was recently rated as one of the top one hundred most powerful people in the world of art by Art Review.\n\nFor more information on the Solid Conference, visit http://solidcon.com.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to O'Reilly to get SolidCon videos as they release: http://goo.gl/szEauh\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\n\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia"
