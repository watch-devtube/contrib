description: 'The Google Games Chat (official motto: "Now with 30% less swearing") is back! And we''re ready to talk about all things Halloween related. Like zombies! And vampires! And things in games that scare us, like corrupt save game files. But we probably won''t get Todd to talk about Amnesia: TDD, because he''s too scared to play it. What a chicken.'
