description: "The hunt for finding product/market fit in an early-stage startup is an elusive one, often fraught with chaos, and certainly never easy. However learning to leverage a cycle of defining, validating, and iterating on each of your most critical product/market fit hypotheses is a sure-fire way to bring some predictability to the process and provide guidance on whether your team is getting closer or farther from the ultimate goal. In this presentation, Sachin Rekhi, serial entrepreneur who built products including Anywhere.FM, a web music player, and Connected, a contact management tool, and advisor to early stage startup companies, shares a framework and best practices to bring much needed discipline to the hunt for product/market fit.
