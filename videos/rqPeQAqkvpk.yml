description: "Building Data-Driven IoT Apps on Cloud Foundry - Dormain Drewitz, Pivotal\n\nOn the other end of every connected device is an application. Actually, many applications. But what about the data? One of the most pressing challenges in the Internet of Things is the flood of streaming data. How do we build applications that can make use of that data? What do we need to change about how we process and analyze that data?\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa - hang on a minute. Is this about Cloud Foundry or data? It couldn't possibly be both.\n\nOr could it?\n\nBelieve it or not, Cloud Foundry has a valuable role to play in supporting *data-driven* IoT applications. In this talk, Dormain Drewitz will provide a model for building IoT applications and illustrate how Cloud Foundry fits in. When combined with Cloud Foundry, projects like Spring Cloud Stream are changing the game for IoT apps.\n\nAbout Dormain Drewitz\nDormain leads Product Marketing for Pivotal Platform Ecosystem, including GemFire, Pivotal's Cloud Foundry Services offerings, and ISV offerings for Pivotal Cloud Foundry.
