description: "MicroPython – Python for Microcontrollers How high-level scripting languages make your hardware project beautifuly easy\nby Christine Spindler\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2215/microcontrollers_python.webm\n\n\nMicroPython is an implementation of Python designed to run on microcontrollers and embedded systems. These devices don’t have many resources (CPU, RAM) and so it’s important to write efficient scripts.\nThis talk shows how to make the most of your resources in MicroPython, and has some fun demos! MicroPython is a reimplementation of Python which is specifically designed to run on computing devices that have very few resources, such as CPU power, RAM and storage.\nOften when you write scripts in MicroPython you want to make the most of your available resources, and have code run as fast as possible (faster code usually saves power, which is important when running from a battery!) and there are certain ways of writing MicroPython code that are more efficient than others. In this talk I will go over the tricks and techniques for writing fast and efficient Python code in MicroPython.\nThe talk will also include some hardware demos to show off these techniques. \n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 14:20:00+01"
