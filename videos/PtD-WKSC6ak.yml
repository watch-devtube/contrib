description: "Math: It's certainly not something you expect to see at a conference about JavaScript, but even this far from its ivory towers it has an important role to play. Together we'll build two categories and see how satisfying the Functor laws suggests a whole new architecture for jQuery that will help developers speed up their client side DOM manipulation.\n\nDon't worry, you don't need to know any Math to understand and enjoy the talk, just some curiosity and a desire to make your JavaScript faster!\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
