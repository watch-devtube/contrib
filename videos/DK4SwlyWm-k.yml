description: "Trio: A pythonic way to do async programming\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Lammermuir]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Emmanuel Leblond\n\nConcurrent programs are super useful: think of web apps juggling lots\nof simultaneous downloads and websocket connections, chat bots\ntracking multiple concurrent conversations, or web spiders fetching\npages in parallel. But writing concurrent programs is complicated,\nintimidating to newcomers, and often challenging even for experts.\n\nDoes it have to be? Python is famous for being simple and\nstraightforward; can Python make concurrent programming simple and\nstraightforward too?\nTrio is an attempt to address this question by the positive !\n\nBy taking advantage of new Python 3 features (async/await keywords,\nasync loops and context managers etc.) while dropping legacy concepts that\nolder asynchronous frameworks has to maintain, Trio defines a new set of\nprimitives that make it dramatically easier to write correct concurrent programs.\n\nIn this talk, we will describe those primitives, and demonstrate how to\nuse them to implement a basic algorithm for speeding up TCP connections.\nCompared to the best previous Python implementation, our version turns out to\nbe easier to understand, more correct, and dramatically shorter.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
