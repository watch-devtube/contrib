description: "Neurologic diseases include more than 600 conditions, affect approximately one billion people worldwide, and are rising rapidly with aging populations. Unlike other organ systems, where the emergence of normative biomarkers such as blood pressure and cholesterol numbers has greatly improved health management, personalized metrics for fundamental brain functions are lacking. Although the complexity of human brains and the diversity of our behavioral traits has made this a daunting task in the past, advancements in technology and information sciences now promise near-term breakthroughs. This presentation highlights new opportunities for using large neurometric datasets to develop personalized medicine approaches for improving brain health and developing therapeutics.\n\nAjay Verma\n\nBiogen Idec\n\nAjay Verma studied zoology at the University of Maryland and received his MD and PhD from The Johns Hopkins University.
