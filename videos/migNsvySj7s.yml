description: "Today Blu-ray players and many set-top boxes and interactive TV sets embed a JVM and are connected to the internet. This session explains how the content producers can take advantage of this by creating Java applications and embedding them within movies or broadcast TV signals that automatically communicate with your smartphones or tablets in your living room. This technique will enable you to build second-screen applications that are easily synchronized without any user intervention; use the smartphones or tablets as controls for the applications on the main screen; and deliver content intended exclusively to be watched or browsed on the second-screen devices and/or stored on them.\n\n\nAuthors:\nDavid Campelo\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by David Campelo at https://www.parleys.com/author/david-campelo\n\nDavid Britto David\nDavid Britto is an IT entrepreneur with more than 28 years experience creating and implementing services and products in Enterprise Business, Mobile, and Consumer Electronics.\n\nIn 1989 he founded Quality Software, a systems integration company that is among the 200 largest IT companies in Brazil.
