description: "NOTE: Audio is a little poor\n\nMuse is a Ruby domain-specific language for creating digital music. In this hands-on webcast presentation by Sau Sheong Chang author of Exploring Everyday Things with R and Ruby, we talk on how Ruby can be used to create digital music through a simple analog software synthesizer, either transcribed from existing music scores, or algorithmically created out of data from various sources. Don't miss this informative presentation.\n\nAbout Sau Sheong Chang\n\nSau Sheong Chang has been in software development, mostly web applications and recently cloud- and data-related systems, for almost 17 years and is still a keen and enthusiastic programmer.
