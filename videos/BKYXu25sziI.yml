description: "Reactive programming is one of the Core themes supported by Spring Framework 5.0 and the other ecosystem projects. Spring Data provides non blocking, reactive support that allows Spring applications to go reactive from end to end. Still, more has happened around Spring Data.\n\nIn this session we will cover efforts made towards reactive data access for those stores supporting this approach. But we will also give an update on recent additions, changes and improvements in Spring Data. Have a detailed look at the supported stores and deep dive into some of their specifics.\n\n\nMark Paluch, Spring Data Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
