title: 'Jeffrey Lembeck: Moneyball for Performance Metrics - CSSConf.Asia 2015'
language: English
recordingDate: 1450503065
description: "The story behind Moneyball was centered around using metrics— newer, out-of-the-norm metrics— to build a better performing baseball team. This strategy of measurement was wildly successful, squeezing out more wins for less money. That works for baseball, why can’t it work for the web? Focusing on our most commonly measured stats only paints half the picture. In this talk, I’ll use those same ideas to give you better ways to determine the quickness at which users can access your site and help you turn up your speed.\n\nJeff is a developer over at npm, inc. He writes a whole lot of code and the occasional post for A List Apart, has guest lectured and TA'd for Ada Developers Academy, and is a former member of the jQuery Mobile team. Jeff lives in Seattle where he obsesses over oyster happy hours and how to make the best negroni. He dreams of someday owning a hot tub boat.\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore - 18 November 2015.\n\nSource: http://2015.cssconf.asia\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/jlembeck/moneyball-for-performance-metrics\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
