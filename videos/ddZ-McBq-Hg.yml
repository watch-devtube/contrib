title: 'DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: The potential in Drupal 8.x and how to realize it'
recordingDate: 1462925607
description: "Drupal 8 switched to semantic versioning which means we can introduce backwards compatible changes and new features with new minor versions (8.1, 8.2, etc). In this conversation, we'll discuss the framework the semantic versioning system allows us to work within, the potential those future Drupal versions may hold and how to get there. Interested in getting something in 8.x? Let's figure out the best way!\n\nAlso new in Drupal 8 are experimental modules which allow us to try out new things and tweak more freely. We'll discuss how this system worked for us and your ideas for the future as well."
