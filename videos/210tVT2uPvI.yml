Most of the existing frameworks like Struts or Hibernate take care of one layer or a part of the application development.\nAs Struts take care of MVC model, Hibernate provides ease of working with databases. However, Spring Framework combines all the industry standard framework approaches (e.g. Struts and Hibernate) into one bundle.\nSpring provides Dependency Injection, Aspect Oriented Programming and support for unit testing. This gives the developer time to work on main business logic rather than worrying about non-application code. Spring makes the application development fast and increases the productivity of developers.\n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1844 230 6362(toll free) or India: +91-90660 20867\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka"
