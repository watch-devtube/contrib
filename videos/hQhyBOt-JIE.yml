description: "SoftBank Robotics develops humanoid robots designed to interact with people. This interaction requires many different aspects of artificial intelligence. In this talk, we will present some of them: functions that are already running on our robots and others that are still under development. This will be an opportunity to highlight the differences between natural and artificial intelligence.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
