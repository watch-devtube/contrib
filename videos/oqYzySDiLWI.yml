description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015\nSpeakers: Dr. Dave Syer, Spencer Gibb \nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/developer-experience-with-spring-cloud\nSo you've decided to go cloud native. You've got a number of microservices that your company builds and runs. They interact with each other in various ways. You've got testing and staging and production environments that may have taken a lot of effort to get right. How does an individual developer work on just one of those services without stomping on other developers using a shared environment? In this session we will explore a range of options for development, starting with deploying everything locally, through stubbing, to local development solution that allows a developer to run their service in their IDE and have the whole system interact on their local machine!"
