description: "Anyone ever give you advice on how to remain a programmer? To avoid being “promoted” into positions away from technology and code? Anyone ever tell you at school or university that you needed social skills to be a good developer? Did you know, without having had half a dozen different jobs, that all development roles are not created equal? Is it true that moving jobs a lot is a Bad Thing?\n\nIn this session I’m going to share some lessons I learnt the hard way while managing my career as a Java developer. I’m going to tell you secrets that others don’t want to share. And I’ll give you tools for working out what your next steps are.\n\nIf nothing else, you’ll get to laugh at the (many) mistakes I’ve made in my search for The Perfect Job.\n\nTrisha has developed Java applications for a range of industries, including finance, manufacturing, software and non-profit, for companies of all sizes. She has expertise in Java high performance systems, is passionate about enabling developer productivity, and dabbles with Open Source development. Trisha is a leader of the Sevilla Java User Group and a Java Champion, she believes community and sharing ideas helps us learn from mistakes and build on successes. She’s a Developer Advocate for JetBrains, which means she gets to share all the interesting things she’s constantly discovering.\n\nFor more on YOW!
