description: "by Nick Desaulniers\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.201/llvm_kernel.webm\n\n\nThe Linux kernel codebase has co-evolved with GCC and binutils over its lifetime, but LLVM is now capable of producing production ready Linux kernels.  Come learn what some of the challenges were in porting the codebase from GCC/binutils to Clang/LLVM, and what the latest efforts are in both codebases to work towards this goal. The Linux kernel codebase has co-evolved with GCC and binutils over its lifetime, but LLVM is now capable of producing production ready Linux kernels.  Come learn what some of the challenges were in porting the codebase from GCC/binutils to Clang/LLVM, and what the latest efforts are in both codebases to work towards this goal. \n\nWe plan to cover some of the previous challenges, current challenges, issue tracker, various continuous integration setups, topics of future interest, usage in production, and how folks interested in helping out can participate.  This talk will be from a kernel developer's (slash recent LLVM contributor's) perspective. \n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 15:45:00+01"
