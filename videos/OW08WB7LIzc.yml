description: "I wondered, can I use JavaScript to predict if a machine will fail? With Tensorflow.js, some sensors, and a little elbow grease, this is totally possible. \n\nAs the price of Internet-connected chips drops, it is now possible to connect anything – literally anything – to the Internet. But we're generating so much data off of these devices that we need some help making sense of it all.  Enter machine learning. This talk is an introduction to machine learning – what it is (and is not!), how it is beneficial, and how you as a JS developer can start learning. We'll cover the basics of building a model and using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and use these skills to predict machine failure. JavaScript developers can use their skills to program the web, build cloud-based applications, develop games and robotics – and now, with Tensorflow.js, you can add machine learning to your repertoire.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNearForm conference 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nTaron Foxworth\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNearForm provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJS0baf5chk"
