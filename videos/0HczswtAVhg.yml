description: "Type safety isn't just a feature of a language, it's also a programming style. While languages like Haskell make it easier to write type-safe code, to get the best results, you need to design your libraries to take advantage of its features. In this webcast presented Michael Snoyman, author of Developing Web Applications with Haskell and Yesod, will describe some techniques to exploit Haskell's strengths, and turn the compiler itself into another tool in your arsenal against bugs and security holes. Don't miss this informative presentation.\n\nAbout Michael Snoyman\n\nMichael Snoyman, creator of Yesod, has been programming for about 15 years, using Haskell for the past five. 5. He brings ten years of web development experience in a wide variety of environments as well as time spent creating documentation.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/snoyberg\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
