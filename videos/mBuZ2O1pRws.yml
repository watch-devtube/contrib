description: "The revamped ASP.NET vNext will do away with duplications in the ASP.NET family's individual frameworks and, by doing so, will combine MVC, Web API and web pages[c1] within ASP.NET MVC 6.\nIt is clear to see that this cannot be achieved without breaking changes. This session will detail all the relative changes as well as the new possibilities that MVC will offer."
