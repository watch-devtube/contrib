recordingDate: 1475490394
description: "\"A Security Testers Toolbox\"\n\nKali, Backbox, Metasploit, BeEF: All tools in an arsenal to break through security barriers. This talk gives you an introduction and demos of the tools and how they can be used to get through your defences. It’s more a massive demo than a talk, as well as an exploration of the available programs and what they can do, to help you understand how to spot problems and defend against them. We’ll cover recon, exploitation, and maintenance of exploits. This session is geared toward developers, IT pros, and those with an interest in learning more about security tools and practices."
