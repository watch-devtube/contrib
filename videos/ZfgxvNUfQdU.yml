description: "RubyConf 2018 - Pointers for Eliminating Heaps of Memory by Aaron Patterson\n\nIn this presentation, we'll cover techniques in Ruby 2.6 that reduce \"dead space\" memory overhead found in all Ruby programs today. First, we'll cover the compilation process of Ruby programs, instruction optimizations, as well as internal data structures used for running Ruby code. Next, we'll look at how to use this information to maintain liveness of Ruby objects in the code. Finally, we'll take all the information we covered so far to develop a technique for reducing dead space in the heap. Remember to mark your calendar because this presentation will be remembered for generations."
