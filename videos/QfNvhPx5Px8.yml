description: "In this episode we're going to train our own image classifier to detect Darth Vader images. \n\nThe code for this repository is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/tensorflow_image_classifier\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nThe Challenge: \nThe challenge for this episode is to create your own Image Classifier that would be a useful tool for scientists. Just post a clone of this repo that includes your retrained Inception Model (label it output_graph.pb). If it's too big for GitHub, just upload it to DropBox and post the link in your GitHub README. I'm going to judge all of them and the winner gets a shoutout from me in a future video, as well as a signed copy of my book 'Decentralized Applications'.\n\nThis CodeLab by Google is super useful in learning this stuff:\n\nhttps://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/?utm_campaign=chrome_series_machinelearning_063016&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=yt-desc#0\n\nThis Tutorial by Google is also very useful:\n\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/how_tos/image_retraining/index.html\n\nThis is a good informational video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpDonQAKtE4\n\nReally deep dive video on CNNs:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmpDIaiMIeA\n\nI love you guys! Thanks for watching my videos and if you've found any of them useful I'd love your support on Patreon:\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\n\nMuch more to come so please SUBSCRIBE, LIKE, and COMMENT! :)\n\nedit: Credit to Clarifai for the first conv net diagram in the video\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
