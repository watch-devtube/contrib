title: 'Testing Microservices with a Citrus twist by Christoph Deppisch'
language: English
recordingDate: 1447230045
description: 'Citrus is a powerful Open Source integration testing tool for automated service API tests. The framework concentrates on the interfaces to boundary applications and services with the ability to exchange messages on client and server side with different message transports (Http, JMS, TCP/IP, FTP, ...) and formats (XML, JSON). The primary goal is an automated integration test of all service APIs where real message communication is sent over the wire. The framework helps to manage complex test scenarios with multiple services interacting with each other. Citrus integrates with frameworks like Apache Camel, Arquillian, Kubernetes and Docker in order to provide automated integration testing of Microservice applications. The tools in action session gives a brief introduction to the Citrus framework and shows code samples for a complete integration test scenario in a Microservices environment.'
