description: "Most of us regularly read web development articles or watch videos that talk about the latest web features, or techniques for implementing all the things and so on. I don't know about you, after almost 3 decades of existence, I realised I'm more of a learn-by-doing kind of person.\nBuilding little components from scratch is a great way to cement your knowledge of CSS properties and try out all those cool things you've read or heard about. You never know when it might come in handy...\n\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 24 November 2016.\n\nSource: https://2016.cssconf.asia/\nSlides: https://www.chenhuijing.com/slides/css-conf-2016/#/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
