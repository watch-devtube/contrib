description: "From the 2015 Velocity Conference in New York: Nobody likes to be kept waiting. Online, waiting means missed expectations, which leads to abandoned shopping carts, lower traffic, and fewer returning visits. Winning the performance game requires understanding not just how fast you are, but how your speed measures up to consumer expectations.\n\nIn 2004, our industry sought to address this issue by creating Apdex. Unfortunately, Apdex doesn’t give you guidance on what the threshold between a good and bad user experience should be. In this talk, Buddy will introduce a new and better metric that’s available to every site.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by SOASTA.\nAbout Buddy Brewer (SOASTA): Buddy Brewer leads strategic initiatives for SOASTA mPulse, a real user measurement tool that tells you how long people are waiting on your site and how it is impacting their behavior. Prior to SOASTA Buddy co-founded LogNormal, the first company to put measuring real users first in the crowded space of performance monitoring tools. LogNormal was acquired by SOASTA in 2012.\n\nBuddy has been helping some of the largest sites on the web solve their performance challenges since 2001.\n\nWatch more from Velocity NYC 2015: https://goo.gl/PZAqiY\nVisit the Velocity website: http://velocityconf.com/\nDon't miss an upload!
