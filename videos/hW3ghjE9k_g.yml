description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nAs a global leader in digital and mobile advertising revenue products and services, OpenX serves ads for many thousands of companies. At peak times, the OpenX Market (a pioneering Real-Time Bidding exchange) alone receives over 1 million bids per second. An additional challenge is that ads must be served in just a few hundred milliseconds. In 2012 OpenX served nearly 4 trillion ads, a near 300% growth from the 1 trillion the Company served in 2011. In order to scale and support this rapid growth OpenX has leveraged Erlang in many parts of its serving stack. In this talk, the architecture will be explored and the open source tools used to build, deploy, monitor and troubleshoot these systems will be discussed."
