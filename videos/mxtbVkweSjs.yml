title: 'YOW! 2017 Julien Verlaguet - Reflex: A New Reactive Programming Language at Facebook'
language: English
recordingDate: 1520755722
description: "Facebook is developing a new experimental programming language called Reflex. Its main characteristic is its “spreadsheet semantics”: the runtime recomputes the state of the program incrementally when changes occur. This talk will cover the basics of the language as well as how things work under the hood.\n\nJulien has spent the last 6 years writing tools for developers at Facebook. His main contribution was Hack (a gradually typed variant of PHP). His current work revolves around reactive programming.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference visit: www.yowconference.com.au"
