description: "Hi Spring fans! In this installment of Spring Tips we'll look at the new programmatic bean registration support in Spring Framework 5 in both Kotlin and Java. This new style compliments the functional embrace in the larger Spring portfolio and is a natural fit for languages with lambdas like Java 8 and Kotlin. Come for the objects and stay for the beans!\n\nJosh Long, Spring Developer Advocate, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
