description: 'In every industry, development and operations teams are moving to containers. While they are excited at the ability to scale and continuously update these applications, they are also challenged at getting the same logging and monitoring insight they once had. Developer and Operations teams not only need insight to logs and metrics with their containers, but with the entire stack in order to deliver great application performance. In this session, you will hear how BILD GmbH, Europe’s largest news portal, monitors and rapidly triages and troubleshoots application and infrastructure issues. You will also hear how you can use Splunk to provide visibility into your container environment, seamlessly allows you to index and analyze logs from your container-based applications, and also, gain visibility across applications and infrastructure by indexing and analyzing machine data across your entire stack.'
