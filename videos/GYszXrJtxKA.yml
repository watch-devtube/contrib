description: "Speaker: Peter Niederwieser\nMore Groovy Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/testing-java-groovy-spring-and-web-applications-with-spock\nSpock is a popular testing framework (mainly) for Java and Groovy applications. After a short introduction, I will discuss Spock's Java and Groovy specific features, will show how Spock can be used for integration testing of Spring applications, and how combining it with Geb yields a powerful solution for acceptance testing of web applications. Finally, I will demonstrate how Spock can be extended to build out the test infrastructure for your project, and will showcase the latest features planned for the mythical Spock 1.0 release."
