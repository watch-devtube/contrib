In this talk, we will go over the main parts of the Google Transformer self-attention model and the intuition behind it. Then we will look on how this architecture can be used for other NLP tasks, i.e. slot filling.\n\nSlides: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hri8veio4rep5g4/Self-Attention_for_NLP_by_Ivan_Bilan.pptx?dl=0\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
