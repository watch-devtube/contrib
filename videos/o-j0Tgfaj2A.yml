description: "Julie Kohler joins Scott Hanselman and shows you how to execute batch geocoding calls using Azure Maps as well as how to get the polygon for a administrative area on a map. Batch geocoding enables a developer to pass up to 10k geocoding or reverse geocoding calls in a single call while Azure Maps handles the processing in the background. The polygon feature enables developers to get the boundaries for things like cities, states and postal codes and use these for doing geometry searches or creating geofences.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\nRoute Matrix, isochrones, IP lookup, and more added to Azure Maps (blog)\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/478/01\n\nAzure Maps overview\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/478/02\n\nAzure Maps docs\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/478/03\n\nAzure Maps pricing\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/478/04\n\nAzure Maps Functional API reference docs\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/478/05\n\nCreate a free account (Azure)\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/free"
