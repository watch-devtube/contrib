recordingDate: 1536777197
description: "Mackenzie Olson was one of our amazing Program Manager Interns this Summer and she focused on making it easier to learn about Service Fabric, access samples and code, engage with the community, and more. Essentially, Mackenzie conceived of, designed, and implemented the forthcoming (stay tuned) servicefabric.io website. \n\nAs an Intern at Microsoft, you are often asked to discover a problem, prove that it's in fact a real problem that impacts customers, then design and build the solution. We're so happy that Mackenzie put her passion, IQ, and energy towards servicefabric.io! \n\nIn this real-time conversation, Charles and Deep learn all about Mackenzie's project and her experience as a PM intern on the Service Fabric team. Mackenzie is entering her Senior year at the University of Washington, completing her CS Major/Math Minor. Go Dawgs!!!\n\nWe really enjoyed working with Mackenzie this Summer. From all of us on the Service Fabric team, THANK YOU! We are looking forward to seeing you again in the future. :-)\n\nIntroducing the one stop shop to find all things Service Fabric related. Coming to a web browser near you in the near future! Enjoy the sneak peak and meet Mackenzie!"
