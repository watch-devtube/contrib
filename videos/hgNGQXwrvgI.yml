recordingDate: 1528194408
description: 'Nowadays infinite data streams are everywhere – logs, metrics, IoT, social activity and many more. The paradigm of the stream processing brings new challenges but at the same time opens new horizons – it allows to revisit some of the classical data processing approaches like batch processing. During this talk, we’re going to have a brief overview of the infinite stream processing problem and will learn about a new Hazelcast product called Jet, which aims to address this problem.'
