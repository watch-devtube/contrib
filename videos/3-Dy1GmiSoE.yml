description: "The AppSec industry is enormously diverse and it only continues to diverge as we put more software into more things with more connections. It’s an industry that’s fluctuating between the sophisticated to the absurd, the intelligent to the primitive and the scary to the outright hilarious. There’s valuable lessons to be taken away from these events and applied in our future security efforts.\nIn this talk I’m going to cover a broad spectrum of what’s happening in our industry – an entire 50 shades of it in only 45 minutes – and you’ll get a sense of just how challenging it’s becoming for those of us working in AppSec to keep ahead of the attacks. I’ll cover everything from the social aspects of hacking through to some of the more obscure attacks and the increasing challenges we have as defenders."
