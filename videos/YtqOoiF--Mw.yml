description: "Speaker: Vincent De Smet (HONESTBEE)\n\nHonestbee has been running Kubernetes in production since mid 2016. We will take a look at how Helm enables you to manage your deployment configurations as code, and demonstrate how it can be used to power your continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. In the presentation we will tackle the following examples and use cases:\n\n- Continuous Delivery using Helm with Drone.io\n- Secret management with VaultController\n- Building and hosting our own chart repositories (and the iterations - we did)\n- Plugins to help manage values\n- Chart best practices\n\nLearn from our practical Kubernetes usage, what benefits Helm and Kubernetes provide us. What challenges you may face adopting these technologies in your company and best practices from our experience\n\nVincent is DevOps engineer at Honestbee and Co-organiser for Kubernetes and Cloud Native user groups in Singapore, Kubernetes speaker for GCP Singapore User Group and frequently presenting for meetups in Singapore."
