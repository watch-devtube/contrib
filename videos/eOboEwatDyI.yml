title: 'YOW! Connected 2017 Anna Harrison - Decoding Design: Because You Are Not "Just Like Your User"'
recordingDate: 1510534801
description: "At this very moment, there are over 5 billion people tapping and swiping on their mobile phones in every corner of our planet. There are people in Sri Lanka tapping and swiping, South-Africa, Ecuador and Tanzania. The Albanias and Swedes, also busy tapping and swiping.\nAs a technologist, your aim in life is to capture as many of these tappers and swipers as you can. Given that there are only about 22 million developers in the world, it is likely that the tappers and swipers will not at all be just like you. Building a product for people like you, therefore, greatly limits the size of your total addressable market - which in short, is really bad business.\nWe know that startups co-founded by designers are far more likely to succeed. But why is this? What exactly do these mysterious Design Creatures do, and more importantly, what can you learn from them to help your product win the tapping and swiping game?\nJoin Anna for an entertaining, practical and example packed presentation that will absolutely change the way you view the role of design in the making of your next product.\n\nDr Anna Harrison is an award-winning speaker, author and designer. Anna leads the UX design and innovation practice at Ephox, makers of TinyMCE. Anna’s passion for people, design and technology is fuelled by her travels and work around the world, where she has helped organisations like IBM, Oracle, NICTA, Unisys and major airports convert dreams and visions into tangible products. Anna regularly contributes to the local Australian Design + Technology scene through speaking engagements and workshops. This year, Anna has joined forces with Paul Morris to bring design education to non-design audiences through their new startup, Indyco.\n\n\nFor more information on YOW!
