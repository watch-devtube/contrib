For developers - applications are the essence, but there are a lot more additional pieces that could influence reliability, accessibility and performance of applications. It will be explained how and why we attracted development guys to the world of monitoring and metrics, the sphere which was considered solely operations playground, how we combined different metrics: business, application, hardware, 3rd parties and metrics from the cloud to reach our goals, which tools and practices proved to be effective and which not."
