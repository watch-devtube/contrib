description: "Get the Code: http://goo.gl/X3Kxc\n\nWelcome to my Composite Design Pattern Tutorial! The Composite design pattern is used to structure data into its individual parts as well as represent the inner workings of every part of a larger object.\n\nThe composite pattern also allows you to treat both groups of parts in the same way as you treat the parts polymorphically. This allows your objects to maximize complexity while also remaining dynamic."
