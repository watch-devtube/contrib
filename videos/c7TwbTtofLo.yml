Compared to any other point in history, humans are flourishing. Yet the way in which we think about the world—and our shared future in it—has not accelerated at the same pace. Join us to find out why the future is awesome, and what you can do about it.\n\nAbout Paul Fenwick:\nPaul Fenwick is the managing director of Perl Training Australia, and has been teaching computer science for over a decade. He is an internationally acclaimed presenter at conferences and user groups worldwide, where he is well-known for his humour and off-beat topics.
