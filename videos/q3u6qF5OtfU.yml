title: 'Good Service: Detect and avoid errors in the world of microservices (Martin Lehmann, Norway) [EN]'
recordingDate: 1545239098
description: "Nothing is worse for your service’s reputation than being unwittingly down.\n\nThe developers at FINN.no are building and operating four hundred microservices to power Norway’s largest online classified ads site. There is no dedicated operations team, yet almost every major incident is limited to a few minutes of reduced service.\n\nAfter a long road filled with adjustments and various initiatives to introduce monitoring across teams and domains, we have found a solution that works for us.\n\nLearn how FINN.no builds nuanced real-time monitoring into a fleet of several hundred services; what to measure, and how to detect and isolate errors within seconds; and how to respond when something goes wrong."
