description: '“How lucky you are that you are paid to work on Open Source Software!” Thanks, but that was not luck. I was lucky that my father put me in front of a Commodore64 when I was four. I was lucky when my application for an MBA got rejected… but I developed OSS libraries for two years before anyone noticed. The truth is that there is absolutely no luck in becoming an OSS developer. You need dedication, will and grit. Along with a strong desire for learning new things: from mastering version control to convincing others of your ideas. The good news is that you can become an OSS developer too!'
