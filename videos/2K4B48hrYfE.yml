title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Avoid DEEP HURTING! Deployment beyond git'
recordingDate: 1493232427
description: "Deploying your site was a recipe for pain before git. Now you just need to do a pull and you're done, right? Well, you have to run DB updates, and clear the cache and revert your features,\_and you forgot to .gitignore that file so your pull failed and-- ARGH! It all culminates in DEEP HURTING.\n\nGit deployment isn't the solution. It's part of the problem. While revolutionary when first introduced to the Drupal community, there remain gaps that git alone cannot close. In this session, we'll introduce how to augment your deployment with Ansible, laying the foundation to fully automate your deployments with free and open source software."
