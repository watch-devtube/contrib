title: 'Building Social Software on Top of Java EE 7 with DaliCore'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784666
description: "As a result of the  Social Media Revolution,  the concept of the  user  is becoming more important in many Java EE projects. Enterprise Java developers often have to integrate their applications with existing social networks. Typical integration examples are enabling users to log in by using their Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn credentials; post status updates to Twitter and Facebook; and invite friends. Reputation management and gamification are also requirements for many projects. This session shows how using the open source project DaliCore (http://java.net/projects/dalicore) builds on top of the Java EE 7 standard and provides basic functionality for managing users, groups, permissions, and content.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJohan Vos\nJohan Vos started to work with Java in 1995. He worked on the Java Linux port with the Blackdown team. He has been doing Java consulting and development for a number of customers in completely different areas. Over the years, he has been active in a number of Java-based community projects, e.g. OSGi, the Glassfish project and JFXtras.org.\nWith LodgON, the company he co-founded, he is mainly working on Java solutions for social networking software. \nSince he can't make a choice between embedded development and enterprise development, his main focus is on end-to-end Java, combining the strengths of back-end systems and embedded devices. His favourite technologies are currently Java EE / Glassfish at the backend and JavaFX at the frond-end.\nView more trainings by Johan Vos at https://www.parleys.com/author/johan-vos\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
