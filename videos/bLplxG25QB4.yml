In addition, they'll explain some of the many advantages Rails has for companies like theirs and smaller teams, as well as some of the disadvantages and gotchas of production Rails apps. Finally, they'll describe their architecture and cover some unique solutions to common problems, including squeezing extra performance out of AJAX with javascript templates and handling activity logging more elegantly.
