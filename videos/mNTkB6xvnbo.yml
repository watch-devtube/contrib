recordingDate: 1596556806
description: 'Operators are a design pattern made public in 2016 to put operational knowledge in software to communicate and integrate with Kubernetes concepts and APIs. The Operator Framework is an open source toolkit to manage Kubernetes native applications in an automated and scalable way. The Operator Framework takes knowledge previously trapped in the minds of administrators, various shell scripts, or external automation software and transforms them into automated Day-1 and Day-2 activities. Learn of the two main components making up the Operator Framework and what’s next for this new CNCF Incubated project donated by Red Hat.'
