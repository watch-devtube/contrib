title: 'DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Understanding the Critical Metrics for Your Drupal Business'
recordingDate: 1462909576
description: "When you first start a Drupal-centric business you will get a lot of well-intended advice like \"know your numbers.\" The problem: existing, more established competitors are naturally apprehensive about sharing key data points or industry consultants are not in the trenches of actually running an agency - their information is purely anecdotal, oftentimes sounds like preaching or is based on inconclusive surveys.  \nIn this session, two active Drupal business owners and entrepreneurs will open their curtain and share the critical metrics that have worked for them. More importantly, the execution of these metrics has led to successful growth-based strategies.  We will address a core set of topics predicated around creating greater operational efficiency. The subject matter will include:\n\n* Financials: revenue, margins, EBITDA, utilization, and managing cash flow.\n* Sales/Marketing: business development, creating brand awareness, and the best tools and resources to leverage.\n* Human Resources: culture, recruiting, and benefits.\n\nThe target audience of this session is threefold: (1.) pass the torch and help new Drupal owners be successful (2.) assist established owners to benchmark their data and (3.) provide insight to those who work at Drupal companies to provide a better understanding of what goes on behind the scenes."
