description: "Teaching AI is the best way to learn AI. In this video, I'll cover 3 very important topics - how to design an AI curriculum,  teaching IRL best practices, and how to create an educational AI youtube video. Tools that we'll use include GitHub, final cut pro, the charisma on command youtube channel, stackoverflow, reddit, and a few others. I hope you find this video useful! I created this video to both help current School of AI Deans create better learning paths for their communities, and to help all Wizards in their journey to master this field.
