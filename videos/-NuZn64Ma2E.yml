Whinston\n\nCenter for Research in Electronic Commerce\n\nMccombs School of Business\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin\n\n\nBased on a joint research with Jianqing Chen and De Liu\n\n\n\nAbstract:\n\n\nInternet-based advertising continues to increase in importance. Internet advertising providers such as Google and Yahoo! allocate their advertising resources using a novel form of share auctions in which the highest advertiser gets the largest share, the second highest advertiser gets the second largest share, and so on. A share structure problem arises in such a setting regarding how much resources to set aside for the highest advertiser, for the second highest advertiser, etc. We address this problem under a general specification and derive implications on how the optimal share structure should change with advertisers' price elasticity of demand for exposure, their valuation distribution, total resources, and minimum bids.\n\nFull Synopsis here: \nhttp://docs.google.com/a/google.com/Doc?id=cdvbh2g5_1621cg97gcct\n\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Andrew B.
