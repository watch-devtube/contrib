description: "Gaurav Malhotra and Scott Hanselman explore tagging support and enhanced monitoring capabilities, including dashboards and improved debugging support in Azure Data Factory. Data integration is complex and the ability to monitor your data factory pipelines is a key requirement for dev ops personnel inside an enterprise. Now, you can tag/annotate your data factory pipelines to monitor all the pipeline executions with that particular tag. In addition, Data Factory visual tools provide dashboards to monitor your pipelines and an ability to monitor your pipeline execution by the Integration Runtime (IR) upon which the activities execute.\n\nAlert and Monitor data factories using Azure Monitor\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/518/01\n\nAzure Data Factory overview\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/518/02\n\nAzure Data Factory documentation\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/518/03\n\nAzure Data Factory pricing\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/518/04\n\nCreate a free account (Azure)\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/518/free"
