title: '[VDT18] Google Cloud Native with Spring Boot by Ray Tsang'

description: "Spring Framework and Spring Boot made a huge stride to make it easier than ever to develop the next generation of cloud native applications. More importantly, a number of Spring projects provides cloud-vendor agnostic abstractions to developers, so that with a simple configuration switch, you are able to move your local application to run in an on-prem datacenter, or in the cloud with managed services.\n\nGoogle and Pivotal partnered to develop Spring Cloud adapters for Google Cloud Platform. With Spring Cloud GCP, you can quickly develop cloud native applications & harness the power of Google infrastructure. We'll introduce a number of projects we've been working on, including:\n\n- Spring Cloud Sleuth integration to send trace data to Stackdriver Trace\n- Spring Data for Cloud Spanner to quickly access globally distributed Spanner database with Object Relational Mapping.\n- Spring Integration channel adapters for Cloud Pub/Sub to use with Spring Messaging.\n- Spring Boot Starters for Google Cloud SQL to quickly connect to managed MySQL or PostgreSQL databases.\n- Spring Resource abstraction for Cloud Storage to inject shared file resources."
