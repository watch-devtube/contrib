description: "RubyConf 2018 - Optimizations in Multiple Dimensions by Jamie Gaskins\n\nOften when we think about performance, we see it as \"if it takes 20 milliseconds to do X, doing X 10 times will take 200ms\". It turns out, there's a lot more to it than that. In this talk, you'll learn about various aspects of performance, circumstances that could make scaling a particular code path non-linear, and even how optimizations can make your app slower."
