description: "We will look at how our team is describing services, dependencies on other services and service providers. From that, we generate valid docker setup scenarios and docker images that we use both to deploy to production and to set up individual testing environments for the developers for testing even complex event-source based scenarios with repeatable results and reliable startup order for the different docker containers in a system.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
