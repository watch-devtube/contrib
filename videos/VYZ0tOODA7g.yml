title: 'Return of the cookie? - dealing with "Private Mode" - Björn Rixman'
recordingDate: 1505215513
description: "MalmöJS is a monthly meet-up for front-end web developer passionates who are pleased to share knowledge, problems and ideas with each other. \n\nArguments drifts around the HTML5 environment with a pitch on Web App development in Javascript and rich page design with CSS. \n\nAuthentication, sessions and security is hard. As frontend developers, this is typically something we'd rather leave to others to take care of. \n\nIn recent years we've seen a steady progression away from using cookies for sessions in favor of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and similar strategies. \"Private Mode\" on iOS is not without it's peculiarities, and in a recent project, supporting it actually increased the risk of making the solution less secure. \n\nTonight will involve a short history of the cookie, an introduction to the concept of JWT and stateless sessions, and the sharing of some hard-learned lessons. \n\nBjörn Rixman is a software engineer at Min Doktor in Malmö. He's been doing web development since the late 90s, starting out as a graphic designer, then gradually shifting focus to development. He is in no way a security expert, but a firm believer in staying curious and asking questions. \n\n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
