language: English
recordingDate: 1603267472
description: "Your thoughts and your emotions affect your work, no matter how much you pretend that you can leave them at the door of your workplace. It's easy to deny your own experience the importance it deserves, especially if it's only inside your own head. But boxing it all away because you have \"work to do\" is like trying to run a marathon while carrying a Labrador Retriever.\n\nIt doesn't have to be that way. This talk will teach you how to frame your world using experiential language rather than clinical language, giving you a powerful tool to discuss your mental health in a way that can be easily felt and understood - and that won't get you in trouble with HR. That sharing becomes the key that unlocks the true power of your team... so come find out how to finally bring your whole self to work!\n\nCheck out more of our talks: \nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcoslo.com/"
