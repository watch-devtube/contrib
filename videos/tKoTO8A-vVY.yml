description: 'As developers, we solve problems, we handle challenges almost every day. Some developers take their technology, tools, infrastructures and frameworks for granted - they "magically" work. They think that by simply using them, they are considered experts. The truth is that they are "expert beginners". However, there are developers who constantly keep learning, dig deeper and understand why things work the way they do. They are on the path to become experts. They are "Active Learners". In this session, we will learn how to become Active Learners and how to avoid the "Expert Beginner" trap.'
