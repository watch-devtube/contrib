description: "Here is a challenge for you: How can we rescue the truth from a sea of irrelevance, share a wealth of technical knowledge and save others from the poverty of ignorance? Why, contributing to www.voxxed.com of course. This talk will look at how to go about writing a technical article, what makes a successful article and why what you know matters more than you think.\n\nKatharine Beaumont is a Java developer by trade, turned Community & Content Manager for Voxxed. Helping developers learn and share knowledge. Contact me at kbe@voxxed.com with any news, articles or tutorials.\n\n[AWT-8881]"
