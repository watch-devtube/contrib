description: "Linkerd 2.0, Now with Extra Prometheus - Andrew Seigner, Buoyant & Frederic Branczyk, CoreOS \n\nIn order to provide zero-config observability for service owners running their application on Kubernetes, Linkerd 2.0 needs to scale to any size Kubernetes cluster. In this talk, Andrew Seigner from the Linkerd team and Frederic Branczyk from the Prometheus team will demonstrate Linkerd 2.0 features made possible by Prometheus, including a user-friendly dashboard, a simple yet powerful CLI, and Grafana integration. They’ll outline how Linkerd evolved its Prometheus integration to leverage Prometheus’s ability to handle massive sets of metrics, and demonstrate the scale this integration enables. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrXs"
