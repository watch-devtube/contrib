description: "Java SE 8 and Java EE 7 have a lot to offer to asynchronous request response programming. This presentation covers their async aspects, from callbacks to event handlers, Promises, Futures, and nonblocking I/O.\n\n\nAuthors:\nMasoud Kalali\nMasoud is author of \"Developing RESTful Services with JAX-RS 2.0, WebSockets, and JSON\" published in 2013 and \"GlassFish Security\" books published in 2010. Masoud is author of numerous articles, and quick references all around from Java.Net to Dzone.\n\nSince 2001 that he has been working in different software development role he has been blessed enough to work on multiple loosely coupled architecture for high throughput message based systems with JMS at heart and rest of the components forming the stops around the JMS as the main messaging bus. \n\nPerformance analysis and performance consulting, at architecture, design, code and deployment configuration is another challenge he has put some of his years on dealing with them.\n\nRESTful services and use of RESTful endpoints for data integration is one of the other practices he went through for data integration between industry leading software systems, IJC and TIBCO Spotfire during his work at ChemAxon. \n\n\nMasoud has worked on security integration is another area specifically in integration OpenSSO with a solid SOA framework used for developing BPEL flow oriented software systems. \n\ncurrently Masoud is a Consulting Member of Technical Staff at Oracle and works/ed as lead engineer in design and development of application server and PaaS offerings of ORACLE cloud service on top of both OVM/OVAB and Nimbula virtualization providers.\nView more trainings by Masoud Kalali at https://www.parleys.com/author/masoud-kalali-2\n\nBhakti Mehta\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Bhakti Mehta at https://www.parleys.com/author/bhakti-mehta\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
