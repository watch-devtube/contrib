description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/ryanjbaxter/beginners-guide-to-spring-cloud\n\nYou have heard and seen great things about Spring cloud and you decide it is time to dive in and try it out yourself. You fire up your browser head to Google and land on the Spring Cloud homepage. Then it hits you, where do you begin? What do each of these projects do? Do you need to use all of them or can you be selective? The number of projects under the Spring Cloud umbrella has grown immensely over the past couple of years and if you are a newcomer to the Spring Cloud ecosystem it can be quite daunting to sift through the projects to find what you need. By the end of this talk you will leave with a solid understanding of the Spring Cloud projects, how to use them to build cloud native apps, and the confidence to get started!"
