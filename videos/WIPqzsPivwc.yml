description: "Intro: AWS SIG - Nishi Davidson, Amazon Web Services & Justin Santa Barbara, Google \n\nSIG AWS has been a user forum thus far. With K8s 1.13 we are doubling down on AWS’s contribution roadmap to maintain and release code, binaries, features, documentation and tests. We have 6 subprojects actively being developed with the community. We would like to discuss these projects, their release status, give an update on our 1.13 release features and our investment wrt testing and scale testing. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Hgru"
