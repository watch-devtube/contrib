description: "🔥Edureka Python Data Science Training: https://www.edureka.co/data-science-python-certification-course\nThis Edureka video on 'Python for Data Science' will help you understand how we can use python for data science along with various use cases. Following are the topics discussed this Python Data Science Tutorial:\nWhat is Data Science?\nWhy Python?\nPython Libraries For Data Science\nRoadmap To Data Science With Python\nData Science Jobs and Salary Trends\nHow Edureka Helps?\n\nPython Tutorial Playlist: https://goo.gl/WsBpKe\nBlog Series: http://bit.ly/2sqmP4s\n\nDo subscribe to our channel and hit the bell icon to never miss an update from us in the future: https://goo.gl/6ohpTV \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/EdurekaIN\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/edureka_learning/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka \n\n#edureka #edurekapython #pythonfordatascience #pythontutorialforbeginners #pythontutorial #pythonprogramming #pythonlanguage\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow it Works?\n1. This is a 5 Week Instructor-led Online Course,40 hours of assignment and 20 hours of project work\n2. We have a 24x7 One-on-One LIVE Technical Support to help you with any problems you might face or any clarifications you may require during the course.\n3. At the end of the training, you will be working on a real-time project for which we will provide you a Grade and a Verifiable Certificate!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the course \n\nPython has been one of the premier, flexible, and powerful open-source language that is easy to learn, easy to use, and has powerful libraries for data manipulation and analysis. For over a decade, Python has been used in scientific computing and highly quantitative domains such as finance, oil and gas, physics, and signal processing. \n\nEdureka's Python Certification Training not only focuses on the fundamentals of Python, Statistics and Machine Learning but also helps one gain expertise in applied Data Science at scale using Python. The training is a step by step guide to Python and Data Science with extensive hands-on. The course is packed with several activity problems and assignments and scenarios that help you gain practical experience in addressing predictive modeling problems that would either require Machine Learning using Python. Starting from basics of Statistics such as mean, median and mode to exploring features such as Data Analysis, Regression, Classification, Clustering, Naive Bayes, Cross-Validation, Label Encoding, Random Forests, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines with a supporting example and exercise help you get into the weeds. \n\nFurthermore, you will be taught of Reinforcement Learning which in turn is an important aspect of Artificial Intelligence. You will be able to train your machine based on real-life scenarios using Machine Learning Algorithms.\n\nEdureka’s Python course will also cover both basic and advanced concepts of Python like writing Python scripts, sequence and file operations in Python. You will use libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit, and master concepts like Python machine learning, scripts, and sequence.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhy learn Python?\n\nIt's continued to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations. Python cuts development time in half with its simple to read syntax and easy compilation feature. Debugging programs is a breeze in Python with its built-in debugger. \n\nIt runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS and has been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. Python is free to use, even for commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license.\n\nIt has evolved as the most preferred Language for Data Analytics and the increasing search trends on python also indicates that it is the \" Next Big Thing \" and a must for Professionals in the Data Analytics domain.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nWho Should Go For This Course?\nProgrammers, Developers, Technical Leads, Architects\nDevelopers aspiring to be a ‘Machine Learning Engineer'\nAnalytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts\nBusiness Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques\nInformation Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics\n'Python' professionals who want to design automatic predictive models\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.in or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775"
