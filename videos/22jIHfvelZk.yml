description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nThis talk will cover every feature addition, removal, and change in the next version of the C++ standard, provisionally going by the name C++17. Covering both the language and the library, the coverage of any given feature must necessarily brief. The goal is to come away with an understanding of what each feature is, and why you might want to use it, with an overall impression of how the new language might fit together. It is not intended to be an detailed tutorial on any individual feature, but rather, a jumping off point for further sessions on the topics that seem most interesting.\n— \nAlisdair Meredith\nBloomberg LP\nAlisdair Meredith is a software developer at BloombergLP in New York, and the C++ Standard Committee Library Working Group chair.\n\nHe has been an active member of the C++ committee for just over a decade, and by a lucky co-incidence his first meeting was the kick-off meeting for the project that would become C++11, and also fixed the contents of the original library TR.\n\nHe is currently working on the BDE project, BloombergLP's open source libraries that offer a foundation for C++ development, including a standard library implementation supporting the polymorphic allocator model proposed for standardization.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
