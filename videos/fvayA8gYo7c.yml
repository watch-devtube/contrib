recordingDate: 1543777262
description: 'Spock is a testing DSL that leverages Groovy AST and the Groovy Compiler yielding great results. The Spock team has been hard at work since version 1.0 was released a couple years ago, adding interesting features such as soft assertions, timed executions, improvements to mock support coupled with dependency injection containers (Spring, Guice), and more.
