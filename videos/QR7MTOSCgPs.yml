description: "Most of us are now so immersed in electronic forms of communication, that we lose perspective on how absolutely absurd the environments can be. This talk is a gentle reminder that we need to not take these media too seriously, demonstrated through a series of anecdotes about the art of trolling those who do. :-)\n\nBen Collins-Sussman\n\nGoogle, Inc.\n\nBen Collins-Sussman is one of the founding developers of the Subversion version control system, and co-authored O'Reilly's \"Version Control with Subversion\" book and more recently O'Reilly's \"Team Geek: a Software Developer's Guide to Working Well with Others.\"\n\nBen co-founded Google's engineering office in Chicago, ported Subversion to Google's Bigtable platform, led Google Code's Project Hosting team, and now manages the engineering team for the Google Affiliate Network. Prior to joining Google, Ben was a senior software engineer on the version control team at CollabNet. He has been an active open source contributor for over twelve years, contributing to projects related to version control and gaming.\n\nBen collects hobbies which tend to explore the tension between art and science. He has given numerous talks about the social challenges of software development.

He has co-authored several original musicals and received multiple awards for musical theater composition.
