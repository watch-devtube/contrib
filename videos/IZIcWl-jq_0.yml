description: "The Long Road to Async/Await in JavaScript: This is a comparison of different methods for performing asynchronous control flow in JavaScript, specifically Callbacks, Promises, Generators / Yields (ES2015), and Async / Await (ES2016). We will explore a simple code example as it applies to each of these different \"phases\" of asynchronous control flow. Finally we'll examine how Async functions are just Promises under the hood and that the two are interoperable. Thomas Hunter II is passionate about technology and building products. A web design business created while attending college slowly evolved into a brick and mortar on Main St. of his small Midwestern hometown. His desire for fame and fortune led to the co-founding of a Y Combinator startup and a life in California.\n\nEVENT:\n\nSFNode 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nThomas Hunter \n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nSFNode Meetup Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nSFNode Meetup YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbWHWaCKZqIm5pE5hSD7KFw"
