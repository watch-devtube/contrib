title: 'Cloud Native .NET - Mark Rendle'
recordingDate: 1528730711
description: "Cloud Native applications are “containerized, dynamically orchestrated, and microservice-oriented”. In this talk I’ll explain what all that means, why you’ll want to do it, and how to get started, including a look at the current state of technology and tools that support cloud native computing.\n\nWe’ll look at running .NET Core applications in Docker; orchestration and scheduling with Kubernetes; designing and building microservice architectures; and maintaining and monitoring applications in production."
