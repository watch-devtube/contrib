There are some vulnerabilities that have recently been discovered in Kubernetes and Docker. So what are the potential risks of these vulnerabilities to the applications and business suing Kubernetes, and how we can prevent these security threat. The talk will cover what are some of the known vulnerabilities in Kubernetes and how we can use open source tools like Notary & OPA to save our cluster from potential security loopholes. How vulnerable is your Kubernetes cluster? Past known vulnerabilities in Kubernetes and their potential risks. How to fix these known vulnerabilities. Security best practices to be followed while designing a Kubernetes cluster. How to use open source tools like Notary & OPA, to do a security analysis of your K8s cluster.\n\nhttps://sched.co/YWJK"
