description: "As a community, we care deeply about performance: our job is to improve customer experience and drive incremental revenue by improving digital performance. But performance goes beyond a bunch of time series charts, page-load times, DNS resolution times, or backend server response times. Ken Gardner explores the latest innovations in performance analytics and explains how data science can be used in surprising ways to visualize and prioritize improvements that lead to peak performance.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by SOASTA.\n\nWatch all Velocity keynotes here: http://oreil.ly/2cJvO9N\n\nFollow @velocityconf on Twitter for news about web performance, DevOps, and continuous delivery."
