description: "Augmented reality is enabling all new experiences, interaction patterns, and technology. As the web begins to adopt AR capabilities, this new medium is now available to web developers. If you know JavaScript, you can develop AR experiences that are enhancements to an existing app, fun bite-size demos, or explore completely uncharted territory.\n\nWe’ll explore what’s possible right now with the process of making an AR experience on the web, including practical use-cases of “augmenting” current web applications, as well as handling progressive enhancement of AR on unsupported platforms. This exploration will take us to where we seem to be heading in terms of AR as a medium on the web platform.\n\nOMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
