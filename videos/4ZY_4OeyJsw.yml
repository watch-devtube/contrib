description: '-Bringing Docker to Windows has been an awesome project - while at times challenging or frustrating the overwhelming majority of the times it’s just been fun.  This talk will focus on the work it took to bring Windows and Docker together, some of the areas where gaps remain between the Windows and Linux platform (specific to Docker) and the roadmap towards convergence.  We will discuss some of the tradeoffs and choices we made as well as some of the lessons we took from the Linux ecosystem and how we applied them as we built out Windows support.'
