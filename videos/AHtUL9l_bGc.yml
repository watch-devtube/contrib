description: 'TDD is much easier to do if you’re using proper tools. With bad tooling the TDD process can be tiring and frustrating. In this presentation I’ll talk how we use TDD in our daily practice at Pragmatists (over 5 years of experiences) and show you some tools that support it. I’ll also show some Java8 tricks that make implementation of tests easier.'
