title: '"Unconventional Programming with Chemical Computing" by Carin Meier'
language: English
recordingDate: 1443286423
description: "Take a step back from your normal programming approach and discover a new way of looking at problems. All living organisms information systems are based on chemical processes. What can we learn by using this metaphor of chemistry in our programming? We will answer this question by looking at Artificial Chemical Computing. Building programs based on molecules and chemical reactions, we will explore new ways of thinking and opening ourselves up to innovation. We will discuss the basics of Chemical Programming and even touch on High Order Chemical Programming as well. Code examples will be in the powerful, elegant, and interactive programming language of Clojure, but you will not need to be an expert in the language to enjoy the demos. Come and join us for this adventure in looking at the programming world from a different perspective.\n\nCarin Meier\nCOGNITECT\n@gigasquid\n\nCarin started off as a professional ballet dancer, studied Physics in college, and has been developing software for both the enterprise and entrepreneur ever since. She has a strong background in Ruby and Clojure. Her passions lead her to the intersection of the physical and digital world, combining hardware and software, where she has helped clients develop Home Automation Systems as well as written a control library for the Parrot AR Drone in Clojure. She is highly involved in the community and spoken at many conferences, including keynoting at OSCON and Strange Loop. She helps lead the Cincinnati Functional Programmers and is the author of \"Living Clojure\"."
