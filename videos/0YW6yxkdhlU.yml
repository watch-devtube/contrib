description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nThis talk presents a new C++20 library for Dimensional Analysis and Physical Units handling. The essential requirements of the library are user-friendliness, compile-time safety, no runtime overhead, and easy extensibility. The syntax of the library is built around a few easy to learn concepts and strictly checked at compile time, which makes it easy to learn and very forgiving for the novice.\n\nThe talk presents motivating examples of why we need such a library, compares the library with other similar products on the market, describes the basic usage and interface, and highlights the benefits of the design choices made.\n\nThe talk is also a great showcase of practical usage of new C++20 features that make the library interface easier to use, maintain, and extend. Concepts, contracts, class types provided as non-type template parameters, and other C++20 features make a huge difference in how we can design Modern C++ code.\n— \nMateusz Pusz\nEpam Systems | Train IT\nChief Software Engineer | C++ Trainer\nGdansk, Pomeranian District, Poland\n\nSoftware architect, chief developer, and security champion with more than 14 years of experience in designing, writing and maintaining C++ code for fun and living.
