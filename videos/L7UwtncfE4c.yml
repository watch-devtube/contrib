description: "Distributed Service Bundles for Cloud Foundry - Krishanu Biswas, SAP\n\nDistributed Service Bundle is a mechanism to define a group of services whose lifecycle and operations are controlled as a single unit. This means parts of the bundle are deployed, un-deployed, updated, operated and monitored together. Cloud Foundry provides well-defined model for application to service communication via the service binding. While this model works well for majority of the use cases, there are use cases where a managed service needs to communicate with other managed services. For example – connecting the Jobs in a managed Spark to Topics in a managed Kafka. Cloud Foundry doesn’t inherently have a notion of service to service binding. To address the above scenarios we need a way to deploy services together with dependencies injected via the environment variables similar to the way CF applications use the VCAP environment variables. In this session, we will explain the need for distributed service bundles and show how such a distributed bundle can be realised via a generic implementation of Cloud Foundry Service Broker.\n\nAbout Krishanu Biswas\nKrishanu Biswas is a Product & Engineering Manager at SAP building server technologies and distributed systems over a decade.
