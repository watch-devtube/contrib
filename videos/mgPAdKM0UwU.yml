description: "Cloud Native applications are “containerized, dynamically orchestrated, and microservice-oriented”. With .NET Core, we can build Cloud Native applications that take advantage of the amazing new ecosystem that has grown around this new paradigm.\nIn this talk I’ll explain what all that means, why you’ll want to do it, and how to get started with .NET Core, including a look at the current state of technology and tools that support cloud native computing.\n\nThe talk will be given using DeckHub, an open source Cloud Native application that I've built as an example. It consists of multiple microservices working together to present a single site, with realtime slide-sharing, note-taking and question-asking. And we'll dig into the code, development processes, configuration, deployment and monitoring that goes into building and maintaining it.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
