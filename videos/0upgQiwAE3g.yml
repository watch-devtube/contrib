description: "Josh Lowe | Saturday 11:30 | Room D\n\nLooking for ways to make the transition from block based programming to text based programming easier, then look no further! In this talk 13 year old Josh will introduce you to his project called EduBlocks, which is a visual block based programming tool that he has created to help teachers introduce programming languages, like Python, to children at an earlier age. The goal of the project is to make the transition from Scratch to Python easier for students and teachers, as presently there is no drop-in solution that bridges this gap. Josh will share his journey so far with you, from how he came up with the idea 18 months ago, the developments along the way, and how schools today as far away as America are making use of EduBlocks."
