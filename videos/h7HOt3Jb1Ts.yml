description: "What is Flutter? In this episode of Coffee with a Googler, Laurence Moroney (@lmoroney) meets with Eric Seidel (@_eseidel) to learn all about it! Hear about how Eric tore the basics of the web to pieces to learn what works and what doesn't, and how this brought about Flutter -- Google’s mobile UI framework for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source. Learn about it at https://flutter.io.\n\nWatch more Coffee with a Googler ? https://goo.gl/5l123N\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
