description: "The Key to High Performance: What the Data Says\n\nDr. Nicole Forsgren, Founder and CEO, DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) \n\nOver the past five years, the State of DevOps Report has shown how high-performing IT teams decisively outperform low-performing peers, deploying 200 times more frequently than low performers, with 2,555 times faster lead times, and one-third the change failure rate. The report has also investigated the effects of burnout, culture and employee engagement on organizational performance. Nicole Forsgren shares insights into the key leadership, technical, architectural, and product capabilities that drive these outcomes, drawn from the latest report. She also offers a summary of the trends uncovered over the last four years from the 23,000+ responses.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
