description: "Google Tech Talks\nAugust 1, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nQuantization is an intrinsic feature of digital signals, an unavoidable nonlinearity in representation. It's instructive to analyze scalar quantization as part of the signal sampling process, how it characterizes the signal, and how signals so characterized can best be reconstructed. The resulting process has many advantages over conventional interpolation. It can reconstruct image structures such as edges and contours with sub-sample precision, an important ingredient of \"superresolution.\" An open question is whether analogous techniques have a role to play in vector quantization. In images, vector quantization is often used spatially, to encode groups..."
