recordingDate: 1523811604
description: "WordPress is currently undergoing a major modernization of the code that controls the editorial experience. WordPress plans to completely change the way users add content to their WP websites, replacing the traditional text editor with a block-based one. The core version of WordPress 5.0 will include the new editor by default. \n\nThe WordPress community is excited over the upcoming WordPress 5.0 release with its new React-based Gutenberg editor. Since Gutenberg is JavaScript based, once it gets embraced by the innovative and vibrant JavaScript developer community, the future of WordPress could be even brighter!\n\nEVENT:\n\nDrupalCon Nashville 2018\n\nSPEAKERS:\n\nAndrew Taylor and Steve Persch\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9ilO4e5lEg"
