recordingDate: 1558446046
description: "A highly controversial copyright reform has been adopted by the EU legislators this spring. But how worried should we be about the proposed #linktax and #uploadfilters?\n\nThe proposal has been widely criticized by human rights advocates, internet activists, youtubers and millions of ordinary citizens, as well as all kinds of tech companies. On the other side we have the content industry and European collecting societies that hope to benefit from the directive.\n\nMattias Bjärnemalm, policy advisor in the European parliament who worked with the proposal, will visit Critical Tech to share his insights from the legislative process in Brussels.\n_____________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend. To make an event at Foo Café, you have to become a partner company with us or you can run a user group with an in-depth technical focus.\nWe welcome companies with sponsor challenges.\nWe are currently present in Stockholm and Malmö and have made over 2048 tech events since the start in 2012. \nAt Foo Café there’s an event going on everyday, year round."
