description: "From OSCON 2015: It wasn’t too long ago that artisans, bathed in the glow of molten metal, forged parts that would go on to make up bigger, more powerful machines. Today, we call those artisans developers. Instead of metal, they use bits and bytes in the cloud to forge a modern application architecture.\n\nIt’s an architecture built for velocity and choice. One that enables companies to build applications quickly and deploy them wherever they need to go, whether public, private, or hybrid environments. And it’s built on a growing, vibrant ecosystem of ecosystems.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll give you a look at the technologies driving this new level of speed and efficiency for application developers (such tech as containers, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenStack, and Cloud Foundry). And I’ll explain why many prominent members of the Fortune 500 are building their futures on this modern application architecture.\n\nAbout Sam Ramji:\nSam Ramji is CEO of the Cloud Foundry Foundation. He has over 20 years of industry experience in enterprise software, product development, and open source strategy. Sam previously served as vice president of strategy of Apigee, one of the five fastest-growing software companies in the Deloitte Fast 500, and is a member of their board of advisors. He joined Apigee from Microsoft, where he was responsible for driving Microsoft’s worldwide open source strategy. He drove many of Microsoft’s contributions to open source and its shift to embrace open source technologies like PHP. He was a leader in BEA’s move into EAI/ESB as a founding member of the AquaLogic product team. Sam has built large-scale enterprise and web-scale applications, leading the Ofoto engineering team through its acquisition by Kodak. His other experience includes leading engineering teams to build large-scale applications on open source software, as well as hands-on development of client, client-server, and distributed applications on Unix, Windows, and Macintosh at prior companies. He is a member of the Institute for Generative Leadership. Sam holds a bachelor of science degree in cognitive science from the University of California at San Diego. His work has been covered in Wired and many other industry publications.\n\nWatch more from OSCON 2015: https://goo.gl/vD6vda\nFind out more about OSCON: http://oscon.com/open-source-2015\nDon't miss an upload!
