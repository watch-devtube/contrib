description: "Lightning Talk - IBM Bluemix - How an Internal Innovation Project Became the Biggest Cloud Foundry Service in the World - Simon Moser, Sr. Technical Staff Member and Dr. Max, Scientist, Architect, and Engineer, IBM\n\nIt's quite a story: in 2012, a bunch of developers in need of a platform where they can quickly push some applications without having to order infrastructure starting playing around with Cloud Foundry. A few years later, this project became commercially known as Bluemix, and with around 1 million users and hundreds of thousands running applications is probably the largest Cloud Foundry certified service in the world today. One reason for its popularity is Bluemix' great service ecosystem - which was fueled by technical contributions from and to the community and therefore serves as a great example how an open source community and a resulting service ecosystem impact each other.\n\nAbout Michael (aka dr.max) Maximilien\nMy name is Michael Maximilien, better known as max or dr.max, and I am a computer scientist with IBM. At IBM Research Triangle Park, I was a principal engineer for the worldwide industry point-of-sale standard: JavaPOS. At IBM Research, some highlights include pioneering research on semantic Web services, mashups, and cloud computing, and platform-as-a-service. I joined the IBM Cloud Labs in 2014 and work closely with Pivotal Inc., to help make the Cloud Found the best PaaS.\n\nAbout Simon Moser\nSimon is a Senior Technical Staff Member with IBM that works both on IBM Bluemix as well Cloud Foundry, where he runs projects like OpenWhisk or the Bits-service. Simon has been publishing many papers and given many talks at International Conferences (such as IBM Interconnect, EclipseCon and other major conferences)."
