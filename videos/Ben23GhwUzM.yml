description: 'One of the long-term advantages of Android over any other mobile platform is that it is open source. What that means for you is that you can rehash it into a new product, a new ROM. That new operating system may not even look like the Android that was intended for mobile phones. The problem with Android customization is that at this point it is mostly black magic - almost no documentation exists and your only way of figuring things out is reading the source code, all 5GB of it. In this talk we''ll explore how to go about customizing Android, and what some of the philosophy behind the organization of the code and the build system is. You will learn at high level how to go about customizing Android by adding custom apps, libraries, daemons, binaries, and other code and resources that go into the operating system. You will also learn about the startup process for a typical Android device and a bit about its security model as it relates to Linux.'
