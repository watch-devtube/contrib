Cool! But how can you be sure that your precious static_asserts actually fire when you need them? There is only one way to know for sure: \n\nYou need to test your static_assert! \n\nThat is easier said than done, though, as static_assert produces a hard, unrecoverable compile-time error. For instance, you cannot test one static_assert with another. \n\nThis talk will demonstrate several options for testing static_assert, ranging from the build system, over the compiler features to template meta programming. It will include real-life examples from sqlpp11. \n— \nRoland Bock\nPPRO Financial Ltd\nPrincipal Software Engineer\nMunich Area, Germany\nFrom my days at the university, I hold a PHD in physics (although that was in the previous century and seems like a different life by now). Ever since then I have been developing software and/or managing engineering teams. In 2008, I started to learn C++ because I could not believe that it was as difficult as some people claimed. Turns out they were totally wrong and totally right at the same time.\n\nToday, I am still learning and I hope to continue to do so for a very long time!\n\nI am the author of the libraries sqlpp11 and kiss-templates.\n\nApart from C++ itself, I'd be particularly interested in talking about strategies for hiring C++ engineers.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
