title: 'Gang up on difficult problems with Mob Programming - Jim Pelletier'
recordingDate: 1506326679
description: "Mob Programming is pair programming taken to the extreme, where a whole team shares a single keyboard and everyone writes code together.\nWe'll talk about our first experiments with mob programming at Page Up. Discuss how this could ever possibly be a good idea. And talk about how you'd go about doing your own experiments."
