description: "PyData London 2018\n\nGiven a predictive model, questions immediately arise: How to improve this prediction? What drives it? Can we operate changes to the system based on the predictions? All these questions require understanding how good is the model prediction, and how do the model predict.\n\nThis tutorial will focus on statistics and interpretation rather than improving prediction.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
