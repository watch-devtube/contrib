title: 'A reference architecture to automate content delivery into your CI CD workflows by Duncan McAllister'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510396299
description: "Content delivery networks (CDNs) play an integral part in the hosting strategies for internet-facing applications by ensuring fast, scalable, and reliable experiences for end users, but CDN automation and pipeline integration can often be a daunting task. Too often these services are integrated late in the delivery process, traditionally in the QA or production deployment phases. Duncan McAllister shares approaches that account for CDNs much earlier in the development lifecycle and highlight specific considerations around CI/CD pipeline integration.\n\n# Duncan McAllister \nDuncan McAllister works on the Akamai Global Consulting Services team as a Senior Enterprise Architect, focusing on Web Performance. Prior to joining Akamai, he served as Enterprise Architect supporting the Architecture and Platform domain for one of Akamai's top 5 e-commerce accounts.
