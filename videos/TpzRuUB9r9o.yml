description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nRachel Laycock - Lead Consultant at ThoughtWorks\n\nABSTRACT\nOnce you've been on a continuously-delivered project, there's no way back. The combination of rapid feedback, high levels of collaboration, and great software quality produces a rapid and effective delivery cycle. With the advent of distributed version control systems and infrastructure automation tools like Puppet and Chef, it is easier than ever to have a deployment pipeline providing fast feedback to the whole team on every check-in. So there are no excuses to not automate everything again, right?\n\"Well that's all great, but my software is on Windows...\"\n\nOK, fair enough, it is still hard and that is why I want to talk about some of the patterns and anti-patterns of continuous integration and deployment pipelines, what tooling is available and what is so hard about windows. I will share some of the ways I have seen these problems solved - good, bad and ugly - and set the stage to make Continuous Delivery a little bit easier in Windowsland. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
