description: "More often than not, people start a new project with choosing a framework that will help to develop it. 5 years ago we chose Play as a base for our internet-banking platform.\n\nMany frameworks offer a rapid start and solutions to common problems out of the box, which is great. However, as your project grows, the benefit of rapid start diminishes and other things start to matter much more – maintainability and control over your code base.\n\nMy talk is about the importance of insulating your code from the framework and any libraries very early, so that you can keep up with the advancing world and business without being constrained by them.\n\nI will share the experience of how we finally became comitters of Play framework and how much of it we had to replace for our advancing needs, leaving only a small part of the original framework that is still being used."
