title: 'Speed up! Incremental Compilation with Nx | Juri Strumpflohner | EnterpriseNG 2020 #ngconf'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623696041
description: "At Nrwl we work with some of the world’s biggest companies. By working alongside their teams, we directly experience the problems and pain points they face on a daily basis, especially when it comes to scaling products and code bases across such large enterprises. These lessons directly influence how we build Nx. We understand the importance of proper DX and how much time and money it can save businesses.\n\nSpeed is one such important characteristic. The fewer time developers have to wait for their CI pipeline to finish, or their app to recompile, the less they get distracted and hence can be more focused and productive. We recently introduced Nx’s computation caching, which together with Nx Cloud addresses precisely that problem. In this talk, we’re exploring how computation caching enables us to go to the next level: implementing incremental compilation in Nx.\n\nLearn the best ways to build reliable web applications, write quality code, choose scalable architectures, and create effective automated tests at the Reliable Web Summit this August 26-27, 2021.
