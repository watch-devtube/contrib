title: 'YOW! CTO Summit 2016 John Viner - The Anatomy of Continuous Deployment at Scale'
recordingDate: 1489324598
description: "Envato runs one of the world’s highest traffic websites, themeforest.net, which is 1 of the 8 sites served by a 2-sided e-commerce platform called Envato Market. Our engineering team juggles serving around 30,000 requests per minute whilst automatically deploying changes once every 30 minutes across a team of 50 developers that contribute to the one codebase. This talk gives the audience a view inside the team’s practices, tooling and culture that allows us to achieve this and maintain high availability.\n\nJohn joined Envato 4 years ago as the Software Development Manager, leading the development teams that build and run the Envato Market. He has enjoyed the challenge of scaling the engineering practices from a single small team to a 50 strong development team as Envato’s success has grown.\n\nPrior to Envato, John led the development teams at Lonely Planet and Playup in Melbourne after spending several years working in the USA and UK.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
