description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015\nSpeakers: Juergen Holler, Stephane Nicoll \nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/modern-java-component-design-with-spring-framework-42\nSpring's programming and configuration model has a strong design philosophy with respect to application components and configuration artifacts. Spring's annotation-based component story is fine-tuned for source code readability as well as consistency across an entire application's codebase. This session presents selected Spring Framework 4 component model highlights, with a focus on the upcoming Spring Framework 4.2 and a selection of Java 8 enabled features, illustrated with many code examples and noteworthy design considerations."
