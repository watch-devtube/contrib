title: 'Autism in Tech - Dennie Declercq - NDC Oslo 2020'
recordingDate: 1598360736
description: "Are all software developers the same? Do all software developers make the same choices? Or are some of them having more worries or just think in a unique way? Yes! of course. There is a group of software developers who are autistic. It can be people with an ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) diagnose. But there also a lot of people with autism missing an official diagnose. Some people are just fighting more than others for getting things done.\n\nIn this talk, I try to cover how the tech world is for me, as a person with autism. I am in tech for about 10 years. In fact, sometimes I feel differences between me and other people in tech. Besides my tech roll in life, I am responsible for a self – a support group of people with autism.\nOf course, I am not only telling about myself. I cover also lessons learned from other people with autism in tech. I talk about unique thoughts, strict decisions and anxiety for changes like updating an environment or trying to complete new classes can be hard for people like me. The same for a lot of things!\nFasten your seatbelt and have a flight into the world of autism in tech."
