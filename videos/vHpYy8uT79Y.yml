description: 'Let''s dominate the world with JavaScript! We are going to take a simple AngularJS ''Simon'' game and quickly convert to run on a small Arduino-like board running JavaScript, switching from a web-based game interface into a real-world interface, with hardware buttons and lights. You will see how you can leverage your existing JavaScript programming skills for controlling real-world electronic devices and hardware and get a quick taste of the amazing things you can do with this technology.'
