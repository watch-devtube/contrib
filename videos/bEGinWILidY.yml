description: "For three years PagerDuty has run \"Failure Friday\", a weekly exercise that uses simple failures like killing a process or adding network latency (in our production environment!) to expose problems in our systems and alerting. This talk will share what we've learned in that time: how our fault injection techniques have changed, the best way to get started injecting failures at your company, and how you can use it to improve your software reliability.\n\nDonny Nadolny is a developer at PagerDuty. He has been using Java for many years, becoming a Sun Certified Java Programmer (for Java 1.4) even before getting his drivers license, and is always interested in talking about distributed systems."
