Making the integration between gitlaband gitlab CI so strong has allowed the project to take away much of thetraditional pain of setting up CI. In this talk we'll look at what GitLab CIhas to offer these days.\n\nWe'll look through how to set up a simple job in a git repository all the waythrough making it a pipeline that runs jobs in parallel on remote machines indocker containers. We'll look at what the strengths and the weaknesses are andgive some tips for running a GitLab CI environment in production.\n\n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 09:50:00"
