recordingDate: 1493173151
description: "It’s easy to get overwhelmed with all the developer buzzwords that are constantly being thrown around and talked about. At the end of the day, no matter what library or framework helps you finish the project, it’s important to remember the basics.\n\nWe often forget, it’s the client’s happiness and their ability to carry on with their project after we step away that matters most. So how can we do our very best work so that our client’s are receiving a top notch website and not just a site filled with the latest and greatest libraries & frameworks.\_\n\nIt’s easy - we get back to the basics.\n\nAesthetically pleasing design\nResponsive, browser-friendly code\nVersion control the entire team can use\nExcessive testing\nClient-editable content wherever possible\nEasy to manage deployment & devops process\nMaintainable code after deployment\nDocumentation, documentation & more documentation\nWe all know that these things are important, but how do we do all of these things and still stay within the project budget? By creating best practices that you can follow over and over again."
