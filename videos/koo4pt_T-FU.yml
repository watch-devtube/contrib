description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/from-0-to-1000-apps-the-first-year-of-cloud-foundry-at-the-home-depot\n\nFrom one team and some hardware in a closet to becoming the platform of choice for hundreds of developers across multiple data centers - what has our journey with Pivotal Cloud Foundry looked like in our first year?\n\nHow did we get our development community to quickly adopt the platform? What are some things we did wrong and would like to help others avoid in their own transformation and adoption? What are some things we did right and would encourage? What were the technical, organizational, and people challenges along the way?\n\nSome we solved. Some we are still working out. We would like to have an interactive discussion about where we are and see what we can all learn from each other about organizational change and driving adoption.\n\nSpeaker: Anthony McCulley"
