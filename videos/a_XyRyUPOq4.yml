description: "It has already been more than two years since the reference implementation of JAX-RS 2.0 provided by Jersey 2.0 was released. Besides the JAX-RS 2.0 standard API, Jersey implementation provides many additional features such as security, monitoring, integration with various HTTP containers and client transports, support for SSE, MVC view templates, various data bindings, reactive-programming support, and more. This session takes an in-depth look at these cool Jersey features that address additional use cases not covered by the standard JAX-RS API. It discusses new additions to the list of Jersey features as well as some improvements that were made in response to community feedback. Where suitable, live demonstrations illustrate discussed topics.\n\nSpeaker:\nPetr Janouch, Developer, Oracle\nPetr is working on project Jersey (reference implementation of JAX-RS 2.0) and Tyrus (reference implementation of JSR 356: Java API for WebSocket)"
