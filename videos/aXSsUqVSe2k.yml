description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nThere has always been great interest in imperative compile-time control flow: as an example, consider all the existing `static_if` proposals and the recently accepted `constexpr_if` construct for C++17. \n\nWhat if you were told that it is actually possible to implement imperative control flow in C++14? \n\nIn this tutorial, the implementation and design of a compile-time `static_if` branching construct and of a compile-time `static_for` iteration construct will be shown and analyzed. These constructs will then be compared to traditional solutions and upcoming C++17 features, examining advantages and drawbacks.\n— \nVittorio Romeo\nBloomberg LP\nSoftware Engineer\nLondon, UK\nVittorio Romeo is an Italian 21 year old Computer Science student at \"Università degli Studi di Messina\". He began programming at a very young age and is now a C++ enthusiast. While following the evolution of the C++ standard and embracing the newest features, he worked on several open-source projects, including modern general-purpose libraries and free cross-platform indie games. Vittorio is an active member of the C++ community: he participated as a speaker at CppCon 2014/2015, ++it Florence 2015 and at his local Linux Day 2013/2014 events, as a Student/Volunteer at C++Now 2015, and as part of Meeting C++ 2015's student program. He currently maintains a YouTube channel featuring well-received modern C++11 and C++14 tutorials. When he's not writing code, Vittorio enjoys weightlifting and fitness-related activities, competitive/challenging computer gaming and good scifi movies/TV-series.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
