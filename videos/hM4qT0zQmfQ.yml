title: 'Introduction to Spring Data Neo4j'
recordingDate: 1321577094
description: "The Spring Data project makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational NOSQL databases, cloud based data services, for instance graph databases. This webinar is designed for enterprise developers that are working with Spring and need to understand how they would integrate a NOSQL graph database.\n\nSpring Data Neo4j is an integration library for the open source NOSQL graph database Neo4j and has been around for over a year, evolving from its infancy as brainchild of Rod Johnson and Emil Eifrem. It supports multiple, annotation based POJO to Graph Mapping strategies, a Neo4j Template API and extensive support for Spring Data Repositories. It can work with an embedded graph database or with the standalone Neo4j Server."
