description: "NorDevCon 2014 - 28th February 2014\n\nThe World Needs Open Source\nby Ruth Cheesley\n@RCheesley\n\nOpen Source is a development model which promotes open access to software, products and systems through a range of different licensing models, allowing the free sharing of knowledge and information across boundaries. The concept of Open Source is perhaps most well known within the IT world, but it is spreading its wings into education, architecture, medicine and more.\n\nIn this talk we will explore the concepts behind Open Source and how it has helped to shape the world we live in, with some real-life examples from Ruth’s experience working in this industry for the past eight years.\n\nWe’ll also consider the commercial side of Open Source – yes, it is possible to make money by giving your work away! – and look at some case studies where Open Source has made a real change to peoples’ lives around the world."
