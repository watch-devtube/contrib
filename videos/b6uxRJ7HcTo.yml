title: 'DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: From 4 releases per year to 4 releases per day'
recordingDate: 1463001255
description: "This session presents a case study where the delivery process for a large government web platform was dramatically improved by automating as much as possible.\n\n\n\nWhen the European Commission adopted Drupal for their internal websites, this project grew organically from a single site to a large Drupal 7 distribution running over 70 websites, developed by a team of 200 developers from 28 different countries.\n\n\n\nAs the project grew the legacy workflow processes that were in use became unmaintainable. This session will show how we moved from a largely manual process to fully automated continuous deployment.\n\n\n\nMoving from SVN to git.\n\nAdopting the “successful git branching model”: feature branches, release branches, tags.\n\nMaking the development process accessible by external contractors by moving from a DMZ to third party services.\n\nAutomating many steps in the QA procedure.\n\nRejecting bad code through static analysis before it reaches a human QA engineer.\n\nProviding automated tests using Behat to replace manual regression testing.\n\nTesting compatibility with new releases of components in the stack (e.g. PHP 7) to catch problems early.\n\nDeploying ticket branches to ephemeral acceptance servers hosted on Amazon AWS.\n\nAutomating Drupal site builds with Drush Make, Composer and Phing.\n\nProviding a “starterkit” that includes standardized build tools to allow rapidly create new websites.\n\nAdopting continuousphp to highly parallelize our delivery pipelines and get quick feedback."
