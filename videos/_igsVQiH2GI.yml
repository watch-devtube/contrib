description: "Speaker: KEVIN GREENE SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER, SPANTREE\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/solving-planning-and-optimization-problems-in-real-time\nPlanning problems, such as determining who should work on a project, what a work schedule should be, how traffic should be routed, or even how to pack your luggage, are hard problems. They get even harder when dealing with changing real world needs and constraints. By using OptaPlanner for handling the planning problem and Spring Cloud Data Flow for handling data ingestion, we can build flexible solutions that adapt to needs in real-time. Come see Kevin Greene give an introduction to planning problems, demonstrate how OptaPlanner simplifies them, and walk through the architecture of real-world solutions."
