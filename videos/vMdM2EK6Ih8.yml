description: "The web development scene has lately been buzzing with innovation, challenging more and more forcefully what our UI architectures should look like. It is time to take a closer look and see what we can learn. This session goes through some of the most successful and innovative new ideas and discusses how they can be applied to UI development with Java, particularly with JavaFX.\n\nSpeaker:\nMichael Heinrichs, Senior Software Engineer, Canoo Engineering AG\nMichael is a user interface creator by passion. He is convinced: no matter which technology and which device, if it has a screen, one can create a truly amazing experience. And pure magic. He works at Canoo Engineering AG as a software engineer on next generation user interfaces. Before that, he was responsible for performance optimizations in JavaFX Mobile at Sun Microsystems and later became the technical lead of the JavaFX core components at Oracle. Michael loves to spend time with his family and cooking. You can find him on Twitter @net0pyr and occasionally he blogs at http://blog.netopyr.com."
