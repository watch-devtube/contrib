description: "Supercharging Development of Cloud Foundry - Vlad Iovanov, SUSE\n\nIn this talk the presenters will describe the software development lifecycle used at SUSE for building SCF. \nSUSE has built a containerized Cloud Foundry distro. This means that the developers engineered tools for developing, building and testing Cloud Foundry that are based on Docker. We will demonstrate tooling that allows Cloud Foundry contributors to quickly develop and test new functionality for Cloud Foundry. We will also compare this containerized workflow with BOSH-lite, the community standard for developing on Cloud Foundry.\n\nAbout Vlad Iovanov\nVlad Iovanov is currently working as a Technical Lead on the SUSE Cloud Foundry project at SUSE.
