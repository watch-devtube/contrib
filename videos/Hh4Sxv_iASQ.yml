description: "Everyone Gets a Data Plane! Multi-Networking Kubernetes with the NPWG Spec - Dan Williams & Doug Smith, Red Hat \n\nWhen one pod network isn't enough, the Network Plumbing Working Group's Multi-Network specification comes to the rescue. In this talk we'll present a detailed overview of the specification and how it helps enable Kubernetes applications in the multi-tenant, media-streaming, NFV, and performance-sensitive application areas. We'll dive into existing implementations like Multus CNI and demonstrate how it makes multi-networking a Kubernetes cluster simple for the app developer and cluster administrator. In addition, we'll cover the future direction of the specification and the Working Group, including what's on the table for Version 2 and the path to natively enhancing Kubernetes' networking capabilities. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrWZ"
