description: "If we agree that building for the user is our main goal as developers, I think we can also acknowledge that this is a process that requires multiple iterations — a process that developers seldom navigate by looking at the data. Usually, there’s somebody else, be it a product owner, marketing or salesperson, analyzing it and feeding developers a feature list needed for the next product release. There lies the gap between developers and users which leads to lots of guess-work.\n\nHow can we remedy this and how can we accelerate this process? What if product micro-metrics could be directly integrated into the user-facing product components? And what if we could build these components to automatically adapt to users’ behaviors based on micro-metrics and provide a personalized user experience?\n\nToday through the use of machine learning it is possible to optimize user interactions by measuring product micro-metrics and automatically adapting user-facing components to provide a personalized user experience."
