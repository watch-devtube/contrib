title: 'Build a Self Driving Car in 5 Min - Fresh Machine Learning #6'
recordingDate: 1470439716
description: "Let's build a self driving car! In this video, I talk about how self driving cars work, then dive into 2 fresh papers that add modern improvements to autonomous vehicles. The self driving car that we build is in a simulated environment and is built using PyGame and the Keras machine learning library. \n\nThe code in the video is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Self-Driving-Car-Demo/\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nPaper 1: Long term Planning for Short Term Prediction\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01580v1.pdf\n\nPaper 2: End-to-End Learning for Self-Driving Cars\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316v1.pdf\n\nMore on Reinforcement Learning:\n\nhttp://www2.hawaii.edu/~chenx/ics699rl/grid/rl.html\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/Artificial-Intelligence-What-is-an-intuitive-explanation-of-how-deep-Q-networks-DQN-work\n\nhttp://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/RLUsersGuide.ICAC2005.pdf\n\nI love you guys! Thanks for watching my videos, I do it for you. I left my awesome job at Twilio and I'm doing this full time now. \n\nI recently created a Patreon page.
