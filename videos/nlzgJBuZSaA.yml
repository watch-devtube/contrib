title: 'GeeCON 2018: Adam Warski - What have the annotations done to us?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1532330769
description: 'Throughout the years, we''ve developed a tendency to use a lot of annotations, rely on frameworks, and fear writing `public static void main(...)` by hand. That''s not without a cause; as a direct or side-effect software development in Java improved a lot. But is that it? Or can we do better? First of all, we''ll explore what are the problems of the status quo, such as limited discoverability due to over-use of annotations or lack of certainty on what exactly happens when our program starts up. Secondly: what''s the next step? It might be surprising: ''just'' using the base language. Both Java, JVM languages and our understanding of programming paradigms evolved significantly. Time to leverage what we now know: let''s use code to describe our classes, methods and express meta-data and let''s bring back main() its proper role in our programs.'
