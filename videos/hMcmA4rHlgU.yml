description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nUlf Wiger - Co-founder and Developer Advocate, Feuerlabs Inc.\n\nABSTRACT\nFeuerlabs Exosense is a modern framework for managing connected devices. Our goal is to provide a hacker-friendly framework, fit for rapid prototyping, yet powerful enough to support long-term evolution and massive-scale deployment. In this talk, we will describe our conceptual approach, and walk through an Erlang-based embedded application prototype for in-vehicle performance monitoring and remote control. We will make the case that a reasonably competent programmer can produce a working end-to-end demonstration within a few days, and still be well prepared for rapid deployment, support and upgrades.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
