description: "The Keys to the Cloud: Centralizing and Improving Permissions in Cloud Foundry - Isobel Redelmeier, Pivotal\n\n Have you ever had a developer who needed to push new code, but you didn't want them to see environment variables? Had to make everyone in a team Org Managers because it got too complicated to track what roles everyone needed? Or maybe you want to be able to make your own roles that combine permissions across components.\n\nPerm, the new permissions service, aims to solve all of these problems. Perm centralizes access control across Cloud Foundry components so that you can better manage, audit, and even customize authorization decisions across your foundations. Perm is also integrating with external identity providers such as LDAP, making it easier to ensure all employees have the appropriate roles even as they switch teams across your enterprise.\n\nFor those rusty on authorization, the talk will provide background on different types of authorization systems, such as role-based access control (RBAC) and OAuth2.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn about how Perm simplifies Cloud Foundry authorization, what Perm's roadmap looks like, and why we've made some of our bigger technical decisions. Most importantly, you'll learn how to improve the security of your platform overall! \n\nAbout Isobel Redelmeier\nIsobel Redelmeier is a software engineer working on Cloud Foundry at Pivotal. She is currently the anchor of the Permissions team and has previously worked on CredHub."
