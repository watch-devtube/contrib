description: "BOSH UI - Thinh Nguyen & Akshaya Khare, Dell EMC\n\nBosh has been utilized as a deployment and lifecycle management tool for VMs in datacenter. However, the learning curve for Bosh can be high as there is no friendly way of setting up Bosh for IaaS(es) in the open source community. Currently, we use command line to setup Bosh. Therefore, we experimentally built a UI for Bosh and proposed a model for entry level deployment of Bosh director from a laptop hooking to a datacenter. Using this UI, as long as your laptop is connected to an IaaS network, you can set up Bosh Director easily with friendly interfaces.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyb/bosh-ui-thinh-nguyen-akshaya-khare-dell-emc"
