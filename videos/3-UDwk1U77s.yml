title: 'How to Generate Images - Intro to Deep Learning #14'
language: English
recordingDate: 1492221788
description: "We're going to build a variational autoencoder capable of generating novel images after being trained on a collection of images. We'll be using handwritten digit images as training data. Then we'll both generate new digits and plot out the learned embeddings. And I introduce Bayesian theory for the first time in this series :)\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/how_to_generate_images\n\nMike's Winning Code:\nhttps://github.com/xkortex/how_to_win_slot_machines/blob/master/WallStBandits.ipynb\n\nSG's Runner up Code:\nhttps://github.com/esha-sg/Intro-DeepLearning-Siraj-Week13\n\nPlease subscribe! And like. And comment. That's what keeps me going.\n\n2 things \n-The embedding visualization at the end would be more spread out if i trained it for more epochs (50 is recommended) but i just used 5.\n-The code in the video doesn't fully implement the reparameterization trick (to save space) but check the GitHub repo for details on that.\n\nMore Learning resources:\nhttps://jaan.io/what-is-variational-autoencoder-vae-tutorial/\nhttp://kvfrans.com/variational-autoencoders-explained/\nhttp://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2016/08/12/introducing-variational-autoencoders-in-prose-and.html\nhttp://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2016/08/22/under-the-hood-of-the-variational-autoencoder-in.html\nhttp://blog.evjang.com/2016/11/tutorial-categorical-variational.html\nhttps://jmetzen.github.io/2015-11-27/vae.html\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nAnd please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
