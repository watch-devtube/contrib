description: "https://2018.jsconf.is/speakers/opher-vishnia/\n\nIn 98’ I made my first webpage, which leveraged JavaScript to annoy visitors with blinking text animations. In 2017 I developed a film entirely in JS, which debuted in the Tribeca Film Festival. You can do so much with the browser today: Procedural art, interactive VR, physical simulation, real-time multiplayer games - and that’s just the tip of the iceberg. In this talk I want to take you a step further beyond sites and Web Apps. Perhaps your next project could push the envelope of the web as we know it?"
