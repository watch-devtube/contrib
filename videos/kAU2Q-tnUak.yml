The garbage collector attempts to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program.\n\nJava Garbage Collector :\n-----------------------------------\n\n***objects are created on heap in Java \n\n***Garbage collection is a mechanism provided by Java Virtual Machine\n\n***Java programmers are free from writing code for garbage collection and they can focus more on the real application.\n\n***Garbage Collection in Java is carried by a daemon thread called Garbage Collector.\n\n***Methods like System.gc () and Runtime.gc () are used to send request of Garbage collection to JVM but it's not guaranteed that garbage collection will happen.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease write back to us at support@edureka.in or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information. \nhttp://www.edureka.co\n\nUse the link to watch all videos of this session :\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ooVrP1hQOHYERMLX7oJHhdXUTPAo3NF"
