title: 'Is Grails the right approach for business apps?'
recordingDate: 1474800473
description: 'When creating a “business app”, there are certain requirements that distinguishes it from other categories of web-based software like advanced filtering and reporting. Are Grails and similar frameworks the right approach to address these concerns, or is a more business centric framework the correct choice?In this talk we will examine what happens if you start shrinking down your solution space from a general purpose web application framework like Grails, towards a more specific one. On the example of the CUBA Platform i’ll show solutions to things like filterable data grids, scaffolding and security concerns that go beyond role based authorization.You’ll learn about the productivity improvements you’ll get out of “Going business specific” and what the drawbacks are that come with it.'
