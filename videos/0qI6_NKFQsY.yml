description: "Over the last decade a lot has happened in the world of Java and testing, but JUnit 4 hasn't kept up. Now JUnit 5 is here to help shape the future of testing on the JVM with a focus on Java 8 language features, extensibility, and a modern programming API for testing in Java. Moreover, JUnit isn't just a Java testing framework anymore. Third parties are already developing test engines for Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, etc. that run on the new JUnit Platform.\n\nIn this session, we will start off with an overview of the inspiration for and architecture of JUnit 5, from launchers to test engines. Then, we will take an example-driven tour of the new Jupiter programming model. We will explore the Jupiter extension model, learn about the extension points it provides, and see how custom extensions for conditional tests, method parameter resolution, lifecycle callbacks etc. are authored and registered. To round off the session, we will discuss migration strategies and compatibility with JUnit 4 and look at the roadmap of what's still to come.\n\nMarc Philipp is a software engineer who works on innovative products for LogMeIn in Karlsruhe, Germany. He is a long-time core committer and maintainer of JUnit and initiator of the JUnit Lambda crowdfunding campaign that started what has become JUnit 5. As a regular conference speaker in Europe, he's thrilled to speak at a conference in the US for the first time."
