description: "In the early days of the web, building a new website would often largely involve HTML and CSS with the occasional sprinkling of JavaScript. Over the years the browsers became more powerful and the use-cases more complex. We found ourselves in a world in which we had outgrown jQuery and now faced a vast array of tools, libraries and frameworks to pick from. Sadly, with these choices also came opinions, endless debates and futile statements such as Angular is dead or \"React is the best solution because of the vDOM\".\n\nI believe that in order to move the web forward we need to take a step back and acknowledge that every developer and project comes with a different background of varying levels of knowledge, use cases and preferences. Framework authors learn from each other, so why shouldn't we?\n\nIn this talk we'll take a look how different frameworks over the years have competed and inspired each other. We'll see how we can combine the lessons from the past and present to work together towards a future of peaceful coexistence."
