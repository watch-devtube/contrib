title: 'Apache Etch: Efficient and feature-rich network services'
recordingDate: 1297779729
description: "By Holger Grandy\r\n\r\nThe talk introduces the Etch framework and shows the simple steps which have to be done to enable an application to be used as a network service. It shows the features of Etch, such as fully bidirectional client to server communication, synchronous and asynchronous calls, data modelling, error handling and performance. The talk gives an overview on the Etch architecture and the implementations of different language bindings, such as Java, C#, C and Go.\r\n\r\nEtch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for developing RPC-like network services. It includes a network service description language for service and data modelling, a compiler, and binding libraries for a variety of programming languages. It supports bidirectional one-way and two-way communication as well as blocking and non-blocking service calls, has high performance and scalability and is easy and intuitive to use. Clients and servers can run in a wide range of contexts (such as thin web client, embedded device, PC application, or server).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
