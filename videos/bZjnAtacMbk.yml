description: "With three million downloads in a year, Groovy still clearly leads the pack of alternative languages on the JVM, but it’s not resting on its laurels. The latest Groovy release, 2.3, is chock-full of useful new features and performance improvements. In particular, Groovy now supports the concept of  traits  for elegantly composing behaviors. Its JSON support is now the most performant of all the JSON libraries available to date. Groovy 2.3 introduces a new markup-based template engine, new code transformations, and much more. In this session, a Groovy project lead guides you through the latest advancements in the Groovy programming language and tells you what’s cooking for the next releases.\n\n\nAuthor:\nGuillaume Laforge\nGuillaume Laforge is the Groovy Project Manager, and Spec Lead of JSR-241, the Java Specification Request standardizing the Groovy dynamic language in the Java Community Process.
