description: 'With Windows 10 and UWP, developers can now build a single application that will target multiple devices. Your UWP apps can now run on devices ranging from desktop and Xbox to HoloLens and IoT devices. This ability to target such a wide range of devices requires some new strategies and planning to enable UWP apps to not only look and function correctly on each device, but to light up device specific features without needing special builds. This session will take a look at how to successfully build UWP apps that target multiple devices and get you ready to start deploying UWP apps across devices.'
