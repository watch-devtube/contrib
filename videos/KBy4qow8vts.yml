description: "Ben Taylor, CEO RainBird.ai\n@RainBirdAI \n\nTechstars is the #1 startup accelerator in the world.  Thousands of companies apply each year, and they only invest their money and time in about ten companies per program location.\n\nFresh from their experience, Rainbird have gladly accepted an invite to speak about their experience at SyncNorwich.\n\nOur Norwich tech heroes beat over 1000 applicants to participate in the 3 month Techstars accelerator program, which culminated in a visit to 10 Downing Street and a final demo day pitch in front of 900 industry leaders and investors in London.\n\nCome along and see Rainbird's final demo day pitch, followed by a fireside chat with the team about their Techstars experience. \n\nwww.rainbird.ai\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/syncnorwich/events/220736077/"
