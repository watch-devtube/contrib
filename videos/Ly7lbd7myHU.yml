description: "RubyConf 2018 - Make Ruby Write Your Code for You by Alex Stephen\n\nDespite best intentions, sometimes you just have to write similar code over and over again. This leads to a massive maintenance burden down the road. But, there’s a better way: have the computer write the code for you.\n\nCode generators are shrouded in mystery and can sound unapproachable, but they aren’t! I’ll show you how code generation is no different than web development and why Ruby has all of the tools to build one quickly. You’ll leave this talk knowing where you could apply code generation in your own code base and how to get started!"
