description: "I'll perform linear regression from scratch in Python using a method called 'Gradient Descent' to determine the relationship between student test scores & amount of hours studied. This will be about 50 lines of code and I'll deep dive into the math behind this.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/linear_regression_live\n\nPlease subscribe! And like. And comment. That's what keeps me going. And yes, this video is apart of my 'Intro to Deep Learning series' \n\nMore learning resources:\nhttp://mathinsight.org/image/partial_derivative_as_slope\nhttp://www.dummies.com/education/math/calculus/how-to-use-a-partial-derivative-to-measure-a-slope-in-three-dimensions/\nhttps://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/06/24/gradient-descent-linear-regression/\nhttps://www.quora.com/What-is-an-intuitive-explanation-of-gradient-descent\nhttp://machinelearningmastery.com/gradient-descent-for-machine-learning/\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack Channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nPlease support me on Patreon:\n https://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
