title: 'Back to Basics: Move Semantics - David Olsen - CppCon 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601694057
description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nMove semantics was one of the many powerful additions to C++11, solving several classes of programming problems that had vexed C++ developers for years. But move semantics can be easily misused, and the details are sometimes tricky to get right. This back-to-basics session will give you a solid foundation in move semantics, covering rvalue references, std::move, move constructors, and move assignment operators. More importantly, it will present a set of clear guidelines for when and how to use these tools, and describe some situations where move semantics are most useful. This session will be helpful both for those who are still learning how to write solid, robust C++ code, and for those who already know everything about move semantics and would like a refresher. Attendees will leave this session having learned, among other things, how to read code sprinkled with calls to std::move and how to write classes that behave correctly and efficiently when moved.\n\n---\n\nDavid Olsen has more than two decades of software development experience in a variety of programming languages and development environments. For the last three years he has been the lead engineer for the PGI C++ compiler at NVIDIA. He is a member of the ISO C++ committee.\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
