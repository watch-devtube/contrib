description: "One-shot learning! In this last weekly video of the course, i'll explain how memory augmented neural networks can help achieve one-shot classification for a small labeled image dataset. We'll also go over the architecture of it's inspiration (the neural turing machine).\n\nCode for this video (with challenge):\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/How-to-Learn-from-Little-Data\n\nPlease subscribe! And like. And comment. That's what keeps me going. \n\nMore learning resources:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzQSQ_0Z-QU\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06065\nhttps://futuristech.info/posts/differential-neural-computer-from-deepmind-and-more-advances-in-backward-propagation\nhttps://thenewstack.io/googles-deepmind-ai-now-capable-deep-neural-reasoning/\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack Channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nAnd please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
