description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nIn the spirit of the Emacs-Vim Editor War and the tabs-versus-spaces debate, the summer of 2018 ended with another epic conflict, the First Notebook War. We'll discuss what all the fuss was about, the event that triggered the war, what we can learn from the opponents and proponents of Jupyter and R notebooks, and how best to benefit from the rapid technological advances of computational notebooks.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
