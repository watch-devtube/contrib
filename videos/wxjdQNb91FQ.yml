language: English
recordingDate: 1392419889
description: "When failure becomes invisible, the difference between failure and success may also become invisible.\n\nWe each want to dissect and apply the lessons gained from the life stories of diet gurus, celebrity CEOs, and superstar athletes. We'd all like to deconstruct success and reconstruct it in our own lives, but looking to the successful for clues about how to better live your life is, at best, an incomplete strategy and, at worst, a giant waste of time.\n\nDavid McRaney will tell the story of how the Department of War Math in World War II helped bring to light the psychology of how we miss what is important when it comes to failure, and how the modern understanding of the psychology of luck provides the best game plan for getting the best out of life."
