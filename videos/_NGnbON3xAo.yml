description: "Elasticsearch is a highly scalable search engine and simple to deploy.\n\nOne of the challenges is to keep the data source (e.g. RDBMS) and the Elasticsearch index synchronized all the time.\n\nHibernate ORM is very popular to persist data in RDBMSes from Java.\n\nWouldn’t it be good if Hibernate ORM could automatically push all changes to Elasticsearch? Wouldn’t it be good if Elasticsearch queries could return domain model objects like a HQL query does?\n\nPlease welcome the latest feature of Hibernate Search, come discover via this tools in action how the Elasticsearch and Hibernate universes are joined.\n\nEmmanuel Bernard is data platform architect for the JBoss portfolio at Red Hat getting his open source hands in Hibernate, Infinispan, Debezium and more.\n\nHe had founded and lead Hibernate Search, Validator and OGM and participated to the Bean Validation spec (as lead) and the JPA one (as expert).\n\nNowadays his focus revolves around NoSQL, analytics and streams of data.\n\nHe is the founder and co-host of two podcasts: JBoss Community Asylum (English) and Les Cast Codeurs Podcast (French).\n\nDavid Pilato is Developer at elasticsearch and French spoken language User Group creator. In his free time, he likes talking about elasticsearch in conferences like Devoxx FR BE UK, JUGs, Web5, Agile France, Mix-IT, Javazone or in companies (Brown Bag Lunches).\n\n[LDL-1473]"
