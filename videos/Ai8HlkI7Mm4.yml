title: 'Simplifying Microservices Security With a Service Mesh'
recordingDate: 1555086587
description: "One of the challenges of developing and securing microservice-based applications in large teams is that services are often developed with different languages and frameworks. Service mesh overcomes these polyglot challenges by moving various aspects of microservice authentication and authorization to a common infrastructure layer.\n\nThis webinar will focus on the various architectural options available to developers for securing microservices both with and without a service mesh. Neeraj will cover how you can leverage a service mesh like Istio in tandem with CNCF projects like SPIFFE and Open Policy Agent to simplify how you secure your microservices."
