description: "Want to really know your IDE inside-out and see how to get into the flow of things when working? Want to understand the difference between an editor and an IDE and how the latter can give you the advantage of understanding the semantics of your applications? Want to be efficient (even productive) with your tooling? Then you know where to come.\n\nDeveloper and creator of many things OSS, his passions includes Web Development and Software Architecture. Has authored a couple of books, a few courses and has been speaking at industry events for nearly 15 years. Currently at JetBrains leading the Developer Advocacy team. Spends as much time as he can writing code."
