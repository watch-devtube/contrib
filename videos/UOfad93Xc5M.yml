description: "SysAdmins are obsolete, we need more DevOps engineers! Or do we?\n\nIn this talk, the author will give several use cases from his personal experience helping organizations to implement DevOps initiatives and automation of software delivery and testing.\n\nWhy technology X is not what you need right now\nWhy ignoring skills that are already present in the team may be a huge risk\nWhy everything-as-code is an effective approach\nWhy not investing in team member education may be very destructive\nWhy not having time is a bad excuse for not automating\nWhy process improvement effects may not be observable immediately\nWhy cost of automation sometimes is higher than the time invested in writing the scripts"
