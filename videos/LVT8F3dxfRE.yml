description: "Machine learning is radically transforming what computers can do for us. But the tools for developing machine learning systems have not yet undergone a corresponding transformation away from conventional programming paradigms. In this talk, we will explore a framework for reconceptualizing software development tools around the experiential nature of learning machines and the multimedia data they learn from and interact with. We will look for common ground between the ways that humans and machines think and learn in order to build tools that will help people from a range of backgrounds and professional interests to extend their reach through the aid of machine intelligence. \n\nWatch the rest of the PAIR UX Symposium talks here ? http://bit.ly/2lMnjyt\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel ? http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
