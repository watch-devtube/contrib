description: "Performance is a feature. We all want our code to run faster, and there are plenty of ways to do this - caching, using a smarter algorithm or simply doing less stuff. In this session, weíre not going to look at any of that. Instead, weíre going to focus on a recent trend in the C# world - improving performance by reducing memory allocations. Weíll see how recent versions of C# allow using structs without creating lots of copies, and weíll have a timely reminder on exactly what is the difference between a class and a struct. Weíll also spend some time with the new Span runtime type and find out how that can help work with slices of existing memory, and how itís already into the types we know and love in the framework. And of course, weíll take a look at when you should and (more importantly) shouldnít use these new techniques.\n\nEVENT:\n\nÿredev 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMatthew Ellis\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
