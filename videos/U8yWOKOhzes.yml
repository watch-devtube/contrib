description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nEnabling Multi-user Machine Learning Workflows for Kubeflow Pipelines - Yannis Zarkadas, Arrikto & Yuan Gong, Google \n\nKubeflow is an open source machine learning platform built on Kubernetes. Every service in Kubeflow is implemented either as a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) (e.g., TensorFlow Job) or as a standalone service (e.g., Kubeflow Pipelines).  As enterprises start to adopt Kubeflow, the need for access control, authentication, and authorization is emerging. Kubernetes CRDs come with their own auth story, but what about Services with their own API and database, like Kubeflow Pipelines? In this talk, we explore how we enabled multi-user workflows for Kubeflow Pipelines, in a Kubernetes-native way.  We present how we combined open-source, cloud-native technologies to design and implement a flexible, Kubernetes-native solution for services with their own API and database. The talk will include a live demo.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeok"
