title: 'Why I’m Not Leaving .NET - Mark Rendle'
recordingDate: 1518601023
description: "We’ve all read at least one blog post from somebody who has left .NET and headed off to a different programming language or development platform (and that one guy who moved to Peru to become a hermit). There’s always plenty of detail on exactly what’s wrong with .NET or C# or Microsoft or the community, and why the thing they’re going to is so great (to be fair, Machu Picchu does have some spectacular views).\n\nWell, I’m not leaving .NET, and I’ll be very happy to give you plenty of detail on why, too. I’ll show a bunch of cool stuff you can do with C#, from cloud-native ASP.NET Core to CPU-native command line tools, mobile apps and games, and I’ll speculate wildly about where the next 20 years might take us on our software developer journeys."
