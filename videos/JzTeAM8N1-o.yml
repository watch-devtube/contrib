description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nDomain Specific Languages (DSLs) are concise, fluent, and carry implicit context. For a language to be used as a host for internal DSLs first it needs to have low ceremony. Then it should provide a way to inject behavior into classes as well. Kotlin has both of those capabilities. In this presentation we will start with a quick discussion of DSLs, their characteristics, and then dive into examples of creating DSLs using the facilities that are native to Kotlin.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., creator of agilelearner.com, and an instructional professor at the University of Houston. He has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences. Venkat helps his clients effectively apply and succeed with sustainable agile practices on their software projects. Venkat is a (co)author of multiple technical books, including the 2007 Jolt Productivity award winning book Practices of an Agile Developer. You can find a list of his books at agiledeveloper.com.
