title: 'Guy Bedford: Package Management for ES6 Modules [JSConf2014]'
language: English

description: "How does the transition into ES6 modules work for browsers exactly? How do we enable modular version-managed front-end architecture in the process?\n\njspm provides almost-magical package management for JavaScript built around the principles of version-managed ES6-modules and the dynamic ES6 module loader from the core.\n\nIn short, jspm starts off by making ES6 modules work dynamically in browsers today through the dynamic ES6 Module Loader polyfilll, then we make all existing module formats work through this same loader, then then we add offline build workflows for production and a command-line package manager to allow modular dependency management. Finally turn the whole thing around and add a CDN with server-push, and you have install-free version-managed module loading in the browser."
