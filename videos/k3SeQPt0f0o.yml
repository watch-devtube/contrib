description: "Sasi Kannappan - Chief Systems Architect, Visa Inc.\nMark Church\n\nDocker has developed a new way of delivering applications, and with that, containers have also changed some aspects of how we approach networking. Visa will detail how they use Docker networking to connect applications in a dynamic environment by using Swarm overlays, service discovery, and load balancing. By switching to overlay networking they will show that they were able to reduce complexity and increase performance. By the end of the talk, you'll learn about the different Docker networking drivers and how you can use Docker networking to architect dynamic and resilient networks."
