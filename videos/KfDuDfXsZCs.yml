description: "The web has disrupted the way developer approach software development. It is Fast, almost FTL. It’s not rare to hear people saying they want their own project to scale like the web, and to evolve as fast as the web. But how does it evolves so fast without being (too) chaotic? The W3C, short for world wide web consortium, is the body in charge of defining the web, the JavaScript APIs that all applications (wether browser or framework rendering web pages) should support to be web-compliant. That process is not well know to web developers which is a pity as their feedback is THE MOST important thing in the evolution of the web. Two W3C Invited Experts will provide insights into the W3C. What is the process through which the web evolve? What are the advantages you, as web developers, could have by following the process, or even becoming an active member? How to make a difference? What is the difference in terms of evolution between the web and the internet? Both will provide feedback from their respective point of view, and will answer questions from the audience.\n\nAs a member of the W3C, IETF and IMTC, Dr Alex is an active participant in the WebRTC community. Among other projects he co-led the WebRTC-in-Webkit project and maintains his \"WebRTC by Dr Alex\" blog with the goal to reduce the barrier of entry into the field for students and individual developers. He holds a Ph.D. in signal, image and video processing at the French INSA and in his free-time helps his previous students from Harvard Medical and Pasteur as a Scientific Advisor to develop in-silico modeling solutions to complement trials of cancer drugs.\n\nDan Burnett is a web veteran who has been participating in the evolution of the web since its early days and has been charing severe of W3C’s working groups. He is the writer of the reference book on WebRTC.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 25+26 November 2016.\n\nSource: https://2016.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
