description: "Audible free book: http://www.audible.com/computerphile \nWhy can't artificial intelligence do what humans can? Rob Miles talks about generality in intelligence.\n\nSean Comments/Questions (For those who can't hear him clearly)\n11secs: \"This was the hill climbing algorithm?\"\n2min 40sec: \"recently with Professor Brailsford we did the idea of The Turing Test, so that strikes me from what you're saying that that's a very specific domain: pretending to be a human talking?\"\n4min 2sec: \"is that like 'humans have been changing the world to meet their needs?' \"\n4min 40sec: \"but on a bigger scale, as you say on a grander scale, building a dam, and er irrigating a field, and putting a pipe to your house and allowing you to have a tap {fawcett} is doing the same thing but on a grander scale.\"\n6min 39sec: \"all these dimensions, if you try to brute force infinite dimensions you're gonna fall over pretty quickly?\"\n6min 45sec: \"change the world\" (in ref to him picking up the drink!)\n\nRetro Z80 Computer: https://youtu.be/OtpaY8VD52g \nHill Climbing Algorithm & Artificial Intelligence: http://youtu.be/oSdPmxRCWws \nThe Turing Test: https://youtu.be/Qbp3LJvcX38 \nArduino Uno: https://youtu.be/b4z1zkmo1BE \nRabbits, Faces & Hyperspaces: https://youtu.be/q6iqI2GIllI \n\nThanks to Nottingham Hackspace. \n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\n\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: http://bit.ly/nottscomputer\n\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.
