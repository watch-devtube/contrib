description: "The 11th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering\r\nMountain View, California, USA\r\nSeptember 19-22, 2011\r\n\r\nTimesheets - When SMIL Meets HTML5 and CSS3\r\nFabien Cazenave, Vincent Quint, Cécile Roisin\r\nPresented by Fabien Cazenave\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we explore different ways to publish multi- media documents on the web. We propose a solution that takes advantage of the new multimedia features of web stan- dards, namely HTML5 and CSS3. While JavaScript is fine for handling timing, synchronization and user interaction in specific multimedia pages, we advocate a more generic, document-oriented alternative relying primarily on declara- tive standards: HTML5 and CSS3 complemented by SMIL Timesheets. This approach is made possible by a Timesheets scheduler that runs in the browser. Various applications based on this solution illustrate the paper, ranging from me- dia annotations to web documentaries."
