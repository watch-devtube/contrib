recordingDate: 1433784667
description: "JavaFX provides a rich client API as a new and exciting way to develop client user interfaces. What are its key strengths and weaknesses? Is it ready to be used in production to replace Swing? This panel discussion addresses the relevance of JavaFX in the context of existing Swing applications. It demonstrates and analyzes applications created in farm management, logistics, mission operations, and artificial intelligence. The panelists show how their applications based on the NetBeans application framework leverage JavaFX, and they share their experiences of replacing Swing with JavaFX and porting Swing components to JavaFX.\n\n\nAuthors:\nSean Phillips\nSean Phillips is a Senior Software Engineer with NASA Aerospace industry leader AI Solutions.
