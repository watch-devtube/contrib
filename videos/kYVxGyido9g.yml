In a C++ application there are many places where not using a keyword or a piece of punctuation is a deliberate decision that carries a lot of information. Consider not marking a member function const, or virtual, or consider not indicating that a parameter is passed by reference. While in some cases this may be an oversight, a reliance on defaults that might or might not be appropriate, in others its a deliberate decision based on careful thought and design. How is a reader to know which is the case? \n\nIn this talk I will show some of the many places where nothingness carries meaning, and talk about approaches to increase the information others can get from your nothingness.\n— \nKate Gregory, Gregory Consulting\nPartner\n\nKate Gregory has been using C++ since before Microsoft had a C++ compiler.
