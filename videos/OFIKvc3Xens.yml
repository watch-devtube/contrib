description: 'WebAssembly is a new cross-browser emerging standard providing a “target bytecode” for languages that want to compile into something that can be run natively inside the browser; in many ways, it’s the culmination of the effort to provide developers with an ability to do “browser plug-ins” without having to be browser-specific, alongside the safety and portability of the Java applet or Flash game. In this talk, we’ll go over some of the different tools of the WebAssembly world, talk briefly about what WebAssembly does–and doesn’t–provide, and look at how to get started using WebAssembly while we wait to see how the world reacts and/or moves to adopt this in a more widespread fashion.'
