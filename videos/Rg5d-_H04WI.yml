description: "DOES18 Las Vegas - Just as mass production defined the landscape in the 20th century, mastering large-scale software delivery will define the 21st. Unfortunately, businesses and the technology leaders outside of the tech giants are woefully ill-equipped to solve the problems posed by digital transformation. Development work is still disconnected from the business needs, and teams are burdened with decades old software architectures and substantial technical debt. A new approach is needed. This session will discuss how BMW Group implemented a connected end-to-end value stream— from requirement to road—and how Tasktop is helping optimize the flow of business value across their entire organization.\n\nConnecting IT to the Business at BMW Group\n\nRene Te-Strote, Senior IT project Lead, BMW Group\n\nCarmen DeArdo, Senior VSM Strategist, Tasktop\n\nDevOps Transformation leader with expertise in the implementation of DevOps, Lean and Agile practices to improve software delivery across all Technologies. Recently worked on the implementation of DevOps practices to accelerate delivery at a Fortune 100 company.

My goal is to consult with other companies to help them determine how they can drive accelerated results across their delivery value stream.\n\nNamed as one of the top 100 DevOps Leaders ( http://techbeacon.com/100-devops-leaders-enthusiasts-experts-you-should-follow-today) and one of the 25 must follow enterprise DevOps leaders (https://techbeacon.com/25-must-follow-enterprise-devops-leaders-twitter).
