recordingDate: 1362964782
description: "Google Tech Talk\nMarch 8, 2013\n(more info below)\n\nPresented by: \nBeryl Nelson\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWhy should it matter whether you work in a team in which people all think the same way, or have different life experiences and points of view?  And what can you personally do to improve diversity in your organization?\n\nBeryl will open her talk with some of the wealth of research and data available about the value of a diverse team composition in terms of financial results and innovation.  However, making a diverse team effective is not simple.  The second part of the talk will include data relating to barriers to the effectiveness of diverse teams.  One of the most difficult problems to deal with, and to measure, is unconscious bias.  Why is it that 52% of Fortune 500 CEOs are over 6 feet tall (182.8 cm), and about a third are over 6 feet 2 inches (187.8 cm)?  Imaginative researchers have found statistical methods that can measure unconscious bias and other barriers to effectiveness.  People who are aware of these barriers can find ways to overcome them, as Beryl will show with a few examples.  Finally, the talk will also focus on recommendations to interested individuals on what they can personally do to improve the diversity of their teams.\n\nA presentation for \"Voices - Creating Global Connections\" organized by Global Tech Women for International Women's Day March 8, 2013.\n\nFor more information, please see http://www.globaltechwomen.com/about-voices-global-conference.html"
