description: "Machine Learning has a lot of potential to make our apps smarter but all the theory and mathematics behind it is really hard! Thankfully, we can rely on trained models and public APIs to do some of the heavy lifting. In this session, we will take a look at some of these friendly Machine Learning APIs for image classification, speech recognition, text entity analysis to see how we can make our web apps smarter.\n\nSara Robinson is a Developer Advocate on Google's Cloud Platform team, where she helps with developer relations through online content, outreach and events.
