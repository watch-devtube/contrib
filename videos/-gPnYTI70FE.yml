description: "Clusters All the Way Down: Crazy Multi-cluster Topologies - Matt Caulfield, Cisco \n\nWhat happens when your application outgrows a single cluster? How do you scale from one cluster to dozens without sacrificing high availability or performance? How do you structure your application to actually take advantage of multi-cluster environments?  In this session, you'll learn about multi-cluster topologies: different options for structuring your application architecture to naturally benefit from multiple Kubernetes environments.   Whether you're building a new application from scratch or scaling up an existing deployment, this session will equip you with best practices, rules of thumb, and the right mental model for successfully using Multi-Cluster Kubernetes. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrWW"
