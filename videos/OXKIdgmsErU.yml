description: "Add to my schedule \nJust Keep Swimming: Don't drown in your open source project!\ngeerlingguy\nPROVIDE FEEDBACK ON THIS SESSION\nAdd new comment\nView slides and transcript of this session.\n\nBurnout. It's not just a problem for core developers. It's something that all of us have to deal with, especially maintainers of open source projects!\n\nHave you ever felt like you're drowning in your project's issue queues, swimming against a strong tide of vague bug reports posted by entitled users, or felt the temptation to delete all your public code to make it all go away? This session will explore the problems maintainers deal with on a daily basis, and equip you with tools to reduce the number of problems in the first place!\n\nI (geerlingguy) maintain over 150 open source projects in both the Ansible and Drupal communities. My projects have almost 7,000 stars on GitHub, and my Drupal modules are used by almost 100,000 sites.\n\nI've been maintaining all these projects, blogging, managing a family with three small children, and still have a smile on my face—well... most days! I'd like to share what I do in the hope that it helps others manage the inherent stress and problems that arise from sharing your work with an open source license.\n\nIf you're in one of the following groups, I'd love to see you at this session:\n\nDrupal.org contributed project maintainers\nOther open source project maintainers\nOpen source contributors\nThose who use open source projects and want to make sure they're not increasing the potential for maintainer burnout"
