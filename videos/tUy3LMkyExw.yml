description: "The popularity of bots is taking off and Engineering teams are finding new and interesting ways to use them in our workflows every day. At Domain, what started as simple ChatOps has grown into a plethora of homegrown bots. These have varying degrees of utility from replacing common administrative tasks, to ordering coffee, to automating technical support. We’ve learned a few lessons about scaling bots, bot frameworks, bot hosting and how to get your bot to stick.\n\nPaul is currently Technology Director at Domain Group where he is responsible for the consumer facing websites and mobile apps. Since joining Domain, Paul has grown his team from 10 to 80 and brought in practices like Agile, continuous delivery, devops and migrated Domain to the cloud.\n\nFor more on YOW!
