description: 'How do you know what 100 millions users like? Wix.com conducts hundreds of experiments per month, on production, to understand which features our users like and which improve or damage our business. At Wix Engineering we have developed our 3rd generation experiment system called Petri, which was open sourced. Petri helps us maintain some order in a chaotic system that keeps changing. In this talk, Talya explain how it works and what are the recommended patterns in conducting experiments that will have a minimal effect on performance and user experience.'
