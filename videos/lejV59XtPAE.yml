Using things you already know, we will explore a new style of writing JavaScript in ES2015+.\n\nIsaac is continually exploring different ways to write JavaScript. Works tirelessly defending his home of middle earth's and other far off land's communications at SMX, a global cloud security and carrier-grade email provider. Passionate about functional programming, he is currently prototyping SMX's next generation front-end stack in ClojureScript and React. Tinkers in his spare time on home automation and autonomous space robot projects.\n\nJSConf.Asia - Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore - 19 November 2015.\n\nSource: http://2015.jsconf.asia\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
