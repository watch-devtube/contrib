description: "We've all felt compelled to say, \"oh but I'm so bad at this,\" lest someone think we might have something valuable to say. We've all felt that surge of inspiration, followed by frustration, sometimes to the point of being unwilling to try again.\n\nI talk about the shit we don't know we don't know, and how we can be intentful about how we learn, challenge ourselves, and share our knowledge. I'll explore impostor syndrome and the fine line between deceit and \"fake it til you make it.\", how yoga and coding are similar, and how to be a constant beginner.\n\nELYSE HOLLADAY\n\nElyse is a Front End Architect at RetailMeNot in Austin, TX. She helps co-organize ATXSass, teaches for GDI, and speaks at conferences. She’s spent her career writing HTML, CSS, and Sass for large product apps, and is always willing to talk about refactoring, women in tech, GIFs, makeup, yoga, and good wine.\n\nhttp://www.elyseholladay.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/elyseholladay"
