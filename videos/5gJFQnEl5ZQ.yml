description: "Why is Go getting so much traction? \nBy Russel Winder\n(@russel_winder)\n\nGo is getting a lot of traction, replacing the use of C, Python, C++, Bash, PHP, etc. in many, many organizations. \n\nSome of the reasons for this are technical: for example, Go is very simple of syntax and semantics, and it has a very straightforward built-in concurrency and parallelism capability.  Many of the reasons for the traction are social: for example, Go is easy to learn and read, Google are funding it's development and marketing and a number of high profile organizations use it. \n\nIn this session we will look at some of these reasons (some of which are interrelated) so people can decide for themselves whether the hype and spin about Go has foundation and merit.\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/222658987/"
