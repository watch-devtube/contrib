description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2012\n\nerlang-solutions.com\nerlang-factory.com\n\n\"Within the last year, the two dominant US mobile operators have eclipsed 100 million subscribers. Along with this honor comes a host of technology issues ideally suited for Erlang-based solutions.\n\nThis talk will explore the perfect storm of opportunity in the mobile industry (and others) including barriers to entry, paths to success, and an extrapolative perspective on where carrier ecosystems are heading. Expect a talk that is devoid of Erlang code examples and laden with anecdotes of why the \"best\" technology doesn't always win, all while remaining generally optimistic on the prospects of an Erlang-centric future. \"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory  twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory ;\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory  linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
