In this talk, Jesse will discuss the core requirements of the GitHub Pages application, why Erlang, Riak, and Webmachine were chosen for the development, and how they were used to fulfill those requirements now and for years to come with minimal development and operational maintenance.\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory \_https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\_\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory \_http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
