description: "From the 2014 Velocity Conference in New York City, Shane Evans's keynote address, \"Virtualization Application Dependencies for Better Performance\".\n\nClick to watch our interview with Shane Evans: http://goo.gl/ALRx4G\n\nModern Application performance isn’t just about the front-end, but the optimization of the front-end and collective services, applications and network that make up the “backend”. Developing one without the others is a sure fire way to fail, and users today won’t always wait for version 2.0 to perform better. In this session, we’ll talk about methods for developing, testing and optimizing application performance from end-to-end when many of the components that contribute to poor performance are outside of our control.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by HP\n\nAbout Shane Evans (Hewlett-Packard):\nShane Evans is a career performance engineer, ScrumMaster, and current product manager for the industry-leading HP LoadRunner performance testing tool.
