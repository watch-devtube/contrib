description: "Kito Mann, Principal Consultant, Virtua, Inc.\n\nSeveral years ago, Web Components was announced as a powerful approach to building applications by using reusable widgets.

The promise is that we will have reusable components that can be used with different JavaScript frameworks or without any framework at all. So, have they lived up to the hype?
