description: "CI/CD in Light Speed with K8s and Argo cd - Billy Yuen & Parin Shah, Intuit \n\nEnterprises have benefited greatly from the elastic scalability and multi-region availability by moving to AWS, but the fundamental deployment model remains the same.At Intuit, we have adopted k8s as our new saas platform and re-invented our CI/CD pipeline to take full advantage of k8s. In this presentation, we will discuss our journey from Spinnaker to Argo CD.1. Reduce CI/CD time from 60 minutes to 10 minutes.2. Reduce production release (or rollback) from 10 minutes to 2 minutes.3. Enable concurrent deployment using spinnaker and argo cd as HA/DR to safely adopt the new platform with no downtime.4. Be compatible with the existing application monitoring toolset. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrRs"
