description: "Speaker: Stanly Lau (ODD-E)\n\nYou have found the more you change the code, the more difficult it becomes. Refactoring is a developer practice of improving the internal structure of existing code without changing the external behaviour. It makes code changes for present or future easier. You may have heard about Refactoring from colleagues, books, articles and have probably tried or hear it the first time. This talk presents what it is, why it is important and what you can do to get better at it based on the experience of mentoring on technical practices to others. This talk is suitable for people who are experienced in programming, have met the challenges of making changes and want to deepen their skill. Demo included!\n\nStanly is a software development coach in Odd-e, helping companies to grow self-managing teams and technical practices. He grew up in Singapore and started programming professionally since ten years ago. He has a deep interest in helping developers to increase their competence in technical skills and has spent many years mentoring teams. He is also the early founders of Agile community in Singapore and organiser of the Agile Singapore conferences."
