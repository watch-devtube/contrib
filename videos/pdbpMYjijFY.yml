title: 'CSS Grid - What is this Magic?! - Amy Kapernick'
recordingDate: 1550755734
description: "We’ve all heard a lot in the last year about a new advancement in the world of CSS, called CSS Grid. Starting off at whispers, we’re now starting to hear it as a deafening roar as more and more developers write about it, talk about it, share it and start using it. In the world of front end, I see it everywhere I turn and am excited as I start to use it in my own projects.\n\nBut what does this new CSS specification mean for software developers, and why should you care about it? In the world of tech today, we can do so many amazing things and use whatever language we choose across a wide range of devices and platforms. Whether it’s the advent of React and React Native, or frameworks like Electron, it’s easier than ever to build one app that works on multiple platforms with the language we know and work with best. The ability to do this also expands to styling apps on any platform using CSS, and therefore being able to utilise the magical thing that is\nCSS Grid.\n\nThe reason CSS Grid is gaining so much attention, is because it’s a game changer for front end and layouts. With a few simple lines of code, we can now create imaginative, dynamic, responsive layouts (yep, I know that’s a lot of buzz words). While a lot of people are calling this the new ‘table layout’, grid gives us so much more, with the ability to spread cells across columns and rows to whatever size you choose, dictate which direction new items flow, allow cells to move around to fit in place and even tell certain cells exactly where they need to sit.\n\nWhile there is so much to worry about when developing an app, CSS Grid means that you can worry less about building the layout on the front end, and more about making sure the back end works well. Let me show you how the magic works.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
