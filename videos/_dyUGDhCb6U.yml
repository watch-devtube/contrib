description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nHigh Performance KubeVirt in Action - Huamin Chen, Red Hat & Marcin Franczyk, Kubermatic \n\nThis talk details a real world solution design of a high performance KubeVirt for running mission critical enterprise workload. KubeVirt brings Cloud Native Virtual Machine management to Kubernetes. It unifies workload orchestration across Containers, Virtual Machine, as well as Serverless. Solution designs around KubeVirt, however, are sparse as of date, especially in networking and storage. On the other hand, workloads running on Virtual Machines often demand high performance and isolation enhancement. In this talk, Red Hat and Kubermatic jointly share with the community their customer engagement experiences of building a high performance KubeVirt environment by integrating with Gardener and multiple CNCF projects, including Kubernetes, KubeVirt, Rook, and Kubernetes Network Plumbing Working Group. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekDs"
