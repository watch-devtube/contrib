recordingDate: 1382337465
description: "A talk from Barcelona Ruby Conference 2013 (http://baruco.org)\n\nWe all know it's wrong to treat people like objects. Have you ever considered what happens when you design your objects to be treated the same way? In this talk Matt explores the intersection between psychology and OO design. You'll leave with some food for thought about how to model the interactions between your objects, as well as how to relate to the people around you.\n\nhttp://www.baruco.org/talks/treating-objects-like-people\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)"
