description: "Transforming Health and Well-being with Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Dynatrace - Michael Villiger, Dynatrace & Bob Johnson, Humana\n\nHumana has been on the leading edge of technology in the healthcare industry for some time now, particularly with the creation of their Digital Experience Center which features Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) and with the maturation of their IT Command Center which features the breadth of Dynatrace’s product line. In this session attendees will learn a number of things, starting with why Humana chose PCF as a key platform to power their digital transformation from legacy software development practices towards modern software engineering. The acceleration of this culture change and new methodology exposed gaps in existing monitoring practices and tools, and attendees will learn how Dynatrace via the Full-stack Add-on for Pivotal Cloud Foundry was able to fill those gaps.  With unique visibility into the entire environment from the user experience to the underlying VMs and everything in-between, Dynatrace provided an intuitive view which simplified problem determination in the and transformed how Humana manages service availability for its customers. Finally, we'll learn about Humana's strategy for the future with public cloud deployment, continuous monitoring with DevOps, and monitoring tool consolidation on the horizon.\n\nAbout Michael Villiger\nLike many current professionals, Mike has taken a long and tangled road within the IT industry.
