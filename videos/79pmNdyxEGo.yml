description: "We're going to replicate DeepMind's Deep Q Learning algorithm for Super Mario Bros! This bot will be able to play a bunch of different video games by using reinforcement learning. This is the first video in this series that uses libraries (Keras & Gym) because if it didn't, the code would be way too long for a short video. I'll make a longer, in-depth version without libraries soon. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/deep_q_learning\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment. That's what keeps me going.\n\nMore learning resources:\nhttps://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0\nhttp://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html\nhttp://neuro.cs.ut.ee/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/\nhttp://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/\nhttps://yanpanlau.github.io/2016/07/10/FlappyBird-Keras.html\nhttps://keon.io/deep-q-learning/\nhttp://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Resources_files/deep_rl.pdf\nhttp://mnemstudio.org/path-finding-q-learning-tutorial.htm\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nAnd please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
