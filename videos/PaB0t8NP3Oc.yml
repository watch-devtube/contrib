description: "This session presents existing testing tools and frameworks in their current stage of development. It compares the capabilities and the kinds of impacts of existing projects. The presentation pays particular attention to questions such as  How can a cross-platform GUI test be created?’With many legacy (Java Swing–based) applications in need of migrating to the new JavaFX 8 platform, it is imperative for GUI code to be testable. The industry needs better strategies and tools for efficient migration from Swing to JavaFX 8.\n\n\nAuthors:\n Sven Ruppert\nSven Ruppert is speaking Java since 1996 \nand working as Principal IT Consultant at codecentric AG in Munich. \nIn his free time he is writing articles for german magazines (javamagazin/eclipsemagazin/entwicklermagazin) \nand tech blogs like JAXEnter.de (http://jaxenter.de/Sven-Ruppert-168244)\n\nThis year, Sven is on his private JUG - Tour: http://www.rapidpm.org/p/conferences-and-talks.html\n\ncontact me:\nTwitter: @SvenRuppert\nG+ : https://plus.google.com/u/0/+SvenRuppert/\nLinkedIn: http://de.linkedin.com/in/svenruppert/\nXing: https://www.xing.com/profile/Sven_Ruppert2\nView more trainings by  Sven Ruppert at https://www.parleys.com/author/sven-ruppert\n\nHendrik Ebbers\nHendrik Ebbers is Java Architect at Canoo Engineering AG and lives in Dortmund, Germany.
