description: "Filmed at http://2015.dotgo.eu in Paris on November 9, 2015. More talks at http://thedotpost.com\n\nGo has well-known downsides, but Go programmers know that they enable higher-order virtues. Microservices also come at huge costs, but enable similar higher-order benefits. Taken together, microservices and Go form a virtuous cycle, boosting developer confidence and happiness."
