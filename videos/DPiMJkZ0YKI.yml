description: "Google Tech Talks\nMay,  8 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nEnjoying amazing ancient structures through Internet technologies is one of\nthe most promising methods to promote our culture and cultural heritage.\nThese technologies involve sensing, transmission, and display. In this talk,\nI will briefly explain these three aspects, and then focus on sensing\nissues, in particular, the technical challenges presented by sensing huge\noutdoor structures. I will describe the technical challenges and how we\nsolved them as we confronted the difficult task of modeling the huge Bayon\nTemple in the Angkor ruin in Cambodia. I will show the digital data we\nobtained, including the entire structure of the temple, the hundred and\nseventy-three faces of deities, and the hidden pediments. I will also\nexplain some of the technical issues involved in displaying the data we\nobtained, using our virtual Aska as an example.\n\nSpeaker: Katsushi Ikeuchi\nDr. Katsushi Ikeuchi is a Professor at the University of Tokyo. He received\n a Ph.D. degree in Information Engineering from the University of Tokyo in\n 1978. After working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's AI Lab\n for two years, Electrotechnical Lab, Japan for five years, and Carnegie\n Mellon University for ten years, he joined the university in 1996. His\n research interest spans computer vision, robotics, and computer graphics. He\n has received several awards, including the David Marr Prize in computational\n vision, and IEEE R K-S Fu memorial best transaction paper award. He has\n served as the program/general chairman of many international conferences,\n including 1995 IEEE-IROS, 1996 IEEE-CVPR, and 2003 IEEE-ICCV. He is\n Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Computer Vision. He is a\n distinguished speaker of the IEEE CS society this year. He has been elected\n as a fellow of IEEE since 1998."
