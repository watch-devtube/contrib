description: "Stratos: A Cloud Foundry UI - Past, Present and Future - Neil MacDougall & Richard Cox, SUSE\n\nAt the last CF Summit Europe, SUSE introduced Stratos UI - an Open-Source, modern, web-based Management UI aimed at meeting the needs of both Developers and Administrators.\n\nFast-Forward 6 months and at the CF Summit in Boston, we showed how Stratos (now a member of the CF-Extensions PMC) was progressing and we demonstrated the new version being developed.\n\nNow, in this talk, we will update you on the recently-released Version 2 - showcasing the new look-and-feel and the new feature set. We&rsquo;ll talk about how we&rsquo;re working to grow the community and what we have planned for the year ahead. \n\nThis talk is aimed at both end-users and developers. We present Stratos with the intent of raising awareness, growing the community and encouraging others to join in and contribute.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyn/stratos-a-cloud-foundry-ui-past-present-and-future-neil-macdougall-richard-cox-suse"
