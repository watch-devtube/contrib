title: 'Snap ML: a highly-accelerated, scalable software library for machine learning | Haris Pozidis'
recordingDate: 1545384063
description: "Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML) is a new software framework for high-performance training of generalised linear models. It combines recent advances in machine learning systems and algorithms in a nested manner to reflect the hierarchical architecture of modern computing systems. Snap ML can accelerate training in distributed environments where intra-node communication is cheaper than inter-node communication. We will review the implementation of Snap ML in terms of GPU acceleration, pipelining, communication patterns and software architecture, highlighting aspects that were critical for achieving high performance. We evaluate the performance of Snap ML in both single-node and multi-node environments, quantifying the benefit of the hierarchical scheme and the data streaming functionality, and compare with popular machine learning software frameworks. We will also present a benchmark on a terabyte-scale click-through-rate prediction dataset and show that Snap ML achieves the same test loss an order of magnitude faster than any of the previously reported results.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
