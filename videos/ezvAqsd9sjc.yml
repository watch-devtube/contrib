description: "by Batuhan Taşkaya\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.120/python_memory_management.webm\n\n\nLearn what is going on behind the scene about memory. How CPython allocates memory? How it manages Private Heap? Does it uses abstractions for managing the memory? Does python relase memory back to the system? Learn how python GC works, reference counting and generational GC. How generations classified? How does reference counting mechanism work? This talk is going to try to answer all this questions. \nMotivation about that subject.\nWhy do i need to know this stuff?\nWhat is the effect of these things on my code quality?\nIs that lecture enough for being a master about this subject? \nUnderstanding Objects\nEverything is an object in python (even code). If we want to understand what is going on behind the scene about memory allocation for objects first we should understand objects. This part has a cpython code reference for PyObject. We are going to learn python objects with seeing how they implemented. \nMemory Management Model\nPython has a great system about managing the memory (the private heap). Heap managed by +1th layer but the main part of this talk is +2th layer, object allocation. We'll discuss them \nSmall Object Threshold\nClassifies objects into 2 sections. If size of an object bigger than 512 it is big else it is small. \nAbstractions\nWe'll talk about abstractions, Arena ❯ Pool ❯ Block \nDeallocations\nWe'll talk about GC, reference count, counting mechanism, generational gc, mark &amp; sweep, generations. \n\n\n\nRoom: UD2.120 (Chavanne)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 12:30:00+01"
