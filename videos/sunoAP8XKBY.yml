description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nScott Hanselman - Principal Program Manager, Microsoft\n\nABSTRACT\nOne day I woke up and Microsoft was different. Maybe it happened overnight, maybe it took many years. Suddenly the ASP.NET Web Stack is open source, hosted using Git on CodePlex and taking pull requests from the Mono team. I can run node.js and Java alongside ASP.NET in the Azure Cloud and deploy them easily. The Visual Studio editor supports HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript in a big way. ASP.NET ships not only the open source jQuery library out of the box but also KnockoutJS, jQuery UI, jQuery Mobile and Modernizr. The Azure SDKs are hosted on Github. What is the Microsoft Web Team doing? What's the plan for this generation and the next generation of Cloud-enabled open source Web Frameworks from Microsoft? Join Scott Hanselman as he tries to put this into a larger context and explain the world's most misunderstood Cloud.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
