title: 'Flow - Am I Your Type? - Mark Volkmann'
recordingDate: 1499244228
description: "Flow is an open source tool from Facebook that is \"a static type checker, designed to find type errors in JavaScript programs\". It supports adding types gradually to variables, parameters, return values, object properties, and array elements. Flow even catches some errors without adding types by using type inference and flow analysis.\n\nFlow supports many types including primitives, functions (with specified signatures), arrays, objects, built-in classes, custom classes, and generic (parameterized) classes.\n\nFlow is similar to Microsoft TypeScript and mostly uses the same syntax for specifying types. However, TypeScript is also a transpiler. One benefit of using Flow is that Babel can be used for transpiling. Babel typically implements new ECMAScript features before TypeScript.\n\nThis talk covers everything you need to know to get started using Flow, including integration with Babel and ESLint.\n\n\nOutline:\n\nStatic vs. Dynamic Typing\nWhy use types?\nWhy avoid types?\nFlow Overview\nTypeScript overview\nInstalling Flow\nRunning Flow\nExecuting Code with Types\nFlow Analysis\nUninitialized References\nToo Few Arguments\nFlow Types\nBasic Types\nFunctions, Arrays, Objects, Classes\nType Aliases\nGenerics\nInterfaces\nDisjoint Unions\nBabel Setup\nESLint Setup\nEditor/IDE Setup\nProject Setup\nflow-typed\nFlow Server\nDeclarations\nReact and JSX support\nFuture Goals"
