description: "Deep Dive: CNCF Cross-Cloud CI – Denver Williams, Debian & Taylor Carpenter, Vulk Coop \n\nThe CNCF CI Working Group was asked to demonstrate best practices for integrating, testing, and deploying projects within the CNCF ecosystem across multiple cloud and bare metal providers. The Cross-Cloud CI project continually validates the interoperability of each CNCF project, for any commit on stable and head, running on Kubernetes clusters which are provisioned to all supported cloud providers. The results of each testing stage are published to the cncf.ci status dashboard. This Deep Dive session will discuss how to implement CNCF projects (for build and e2e testing) and cloud providers (for Kubernetes provisioning). It may include an interactive walk-through of adding a new project or cloud provider to the Cross-Cloud CI system. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Greb"
