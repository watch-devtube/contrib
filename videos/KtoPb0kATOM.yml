description: "The economics of the cloud and the demand created by new platforms such as mobile and social have led the giants of the web to the microservices architectural style. Microservices sit at the intersection of DevOps, web services, big data, and the cloud. They scale out and embrace (and are resilient in the face of) failure. Microservices also promote the use of the best technology for the job and introduce complexity of their own in the interactions. This tutorial looks at techniques for removing that complexity and promoting resilient cloud-native applications. Main topics: - \"Bootcamp\" - 12-Factor Configuration - Service Discovery/Registration - Data & NoSQL - Resilient Service to Service Invocations - Building for a PaaS\n\nSpeaker:\nJosh (@starbuxman) is a Java Champion, author of 5 books (including O'Reilly's upcoming \"Spring Boot Essentials: Buidling Applications and Microservices in the Cloud\") and 3 best-selling video trainings (including the best-selling Building Microservices with Spring Boot Livelessons jointly authored with Spring Boot [creator Phil Webb), a contributor to numerous open-source projects including Spring Boot, Spring Integration, Spring Cloud, Activiti and Vaadin and the Spring Developer Advocate at Pivotal"
