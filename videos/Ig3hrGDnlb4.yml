title: 'Kevin Falcone (‎jibsheet‎) - ‎State of rt.cpan.org and rt.perl.org‎'
language: English
recordingDate: 1403625605
description: 'Best Practical took over primary support of rt.perl.org and completed a major upgrade last year. We''ve also worked with the perl.org admins to upgrade and support rt.cpan.org. We''ll talk a little about the history of the systems (why does rt.cpan.org exist?) and how they work today. If you taunt me, we''ll talk about how the email integrations work. We''ll talk about the open source code they''re built on and how you can help hack on them. We''re working on upgrades to the newest series of RT (4.2) and will talk about features that will help CPAN authors and core perl hackers make better use of the systems.'
