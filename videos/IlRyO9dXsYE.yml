description: "Get the Code Here: http://goo.gl/Z6z3U\n\nWelcome to my Java Shell Sort tutorial! I really tried to have fun explaining how the Shell Sort works in this tutorial. I show how it works in 4 different ways. We see it graphically, in a presentation format, explained during execution and again in the code itself. Everything can be found in the link above.\n\nThe Shell Sort is one of the fastest of the easier to understand sorting algorithms. It is similar to the insertion sort, but it has an added feature in which it partially sorts the array before the insertion sort is used. The video and code will explain everything."
