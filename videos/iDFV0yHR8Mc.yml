description: 'Building PaaS on Amazon is something that might be considered as inventing the wheel. But what if your acquisition strategy is so aggressive, that you end up with dozens of different products running on different stacks and on hundreds of AWS accounts? And you continue growing with even higher pace? Central Docker platform is internally built PaaS for Aurea’s businesses that sets aggressive goals: high container density on biggest instances AWS can offer and at the same time decrease operational costs. We are going to tell you the story of our platform, what issues we face with running 600+ containers of different kinds on a single node and how kubernetes fits into all this.'
