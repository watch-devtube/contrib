description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016/johan-blom\n\nErly Marsh is concerned with Model-Based Testing, which is an approach to make testing more systematic. The general idea in Model-Based Testing is to start from a formal model, which captures the intended behaviour of the software system to be tested. On the basis of this model, test cases can be automatically generated in a systematic way. Further, by the use of coverage criteria, Erly Marsh is able to quantify to which degree test cases exercise the tested software."
