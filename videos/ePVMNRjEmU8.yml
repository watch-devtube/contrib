description: "Big Answers\n\nSociety confronts enormous challenges today: How will we feed nine billion people? How can we diagnose and treat diseases better, and more cheaply? How will we produce more energy, more cleanly, than ever before?\n\nBig questions like these demand new approaches, and \"Big Data\" is a crucial of the toolkit we will use over the coming years to answer them. New algorithms, applied to much more raw data than has ever been available before, will help professionals in almost every discipline make better, more informed decisions, and will guide research and policy toward better outcomes, faster.\n\nBorn in the consumer internet, the Apache Hadoop platform has, over the last six years, become a critical piece of infrastructure for government, commercial and research organizations that need to answer big questions using Big Data. In his opening keynote, Mike will explore some revolutionary use cases form his own experiences at Cloudera and will show how building applications within a broader community and ecosystem has vast implications for the speed and depth of innovation, helping humanity to ask bigger questions and gain bigger answers."
