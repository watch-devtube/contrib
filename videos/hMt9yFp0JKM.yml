We’ll cover:; Consistent hashing; Strategies for replication; Working out distributed state with Gossip; Recovering from failure with Hinted handoff and Anti-entropy repair;We’ll also talk about why picking a masterless architecture, and trading availability and partition tolerance for consistency really can lead to a linearly scalable database. \n\nRead more: http://oredev.org/2015/sessions/dynamo-the-paper-that-changed-the-database-world \n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
