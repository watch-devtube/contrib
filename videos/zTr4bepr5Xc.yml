description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nFebruary 15, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Steven J Wallach, Convey Computer Corp. \r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nHPC research is focused on achieving ExaFlop/ExaOP performance by 2020. Unlike reaching a PetaFlop, the general consensus is that vastly new programming paradigms, hardware architectures, and interconnects will be needed (as well as new power plants). This presentation will be focused on increasing uni-processor performance and the roles played by application specific heterogeneous computing and compilers in evolving processor architecture.\r\n\r\nSteven J Wallach is a founder of Convey Computer Corporation and is an adviser to venture capital firms CenterPoint Ventures, Sevin-Rosen and InterWest Partners. Previously, he served as vice president of technology for Chiaro Networks Ltd., and as co-founder, chief technology officer and senior vice president of development of Convex Computer Corporation. After Hewlett-Packard Co. bought Convex, Wallach became chief technology officer of HP's Enterprise Systems Group. Wallach served as a consultant to the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Simulation and Computing Program at Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1998 to 2007. He was also a visiting professor at Rice University in 1998 and 1999, and was manager of advanced development for Data General Corporation. His efforts on the MV/8000 are chronicled in Tracy Kidder's Pulitzer Prize winning book, \"The Soul of a New Machine.\" Wallach, who has 34 patents, is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, an IEEE Fellow, and was a founding member of the Presidential Information Technology Advisory Committee. He is the 2008 recipient of IEEE's prestigious Seymour Cray Award."
