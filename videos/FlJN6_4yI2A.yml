description: "3x  Explore, Expand, Extract\n\nBefore you can evaluate a method, you have to understand its goals. Before you can evaluate a style of software engineering, you have to understand its goals. Quick execution of experiments? Rapid scaling in the face of unexpected bottlenecks? Sustained, profitable growth? Each goals requires a different style and yet we talk about software engineering as if it should be one thing.\nThis talk introduces 3X and the ways software development, quality assurance, design, management, financing, planning, and staffing change depending on the goal of development.\n\nConsistently challenges software engineering dogma, promoting ideas like patterns, test-driven development, and Extreme Programming. Currently affiliated with Three Rivers Institute and Agitar Software, he is the author of many Addison-Wesley titles.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
