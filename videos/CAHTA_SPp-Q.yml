recordingDate: 1540491374
description: "Karthik Gaekwad, Principal Engineer, Oracle\n\nKubernetes is a force to be reckoned with for enterprises, and there’s been a major shift to move their infrastructure to use Kubernetes. This session covers best practices you’ll want to keep in mind when making a shift from deploying applications to web servers and moving to a microservices model and Kubernetes. You’ll learn about topics you should consider while moving to Kubernetes and principles you should follow when building out your Kubernetes-based applications or infrastructure. The ideas presented are from war stories and experiences of working in the trenches with Kubernetes for the managed service for Oracle Cloud. You’ll leave the session with best practices to implement in your own organization when it comes to Kubernetes."
