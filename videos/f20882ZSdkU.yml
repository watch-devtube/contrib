title: 'Big(ger) Sets: Making CRDT Sets Scale in Riak by Russell Brown'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474880412
description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016/russell-brown\n\nWhen Riak 2.0 shipped with CRDTs as Riak Data Types it was the first commercial database product to include this research-driven technology. CRDTs promised much in the way of making eventual consistency easier to use but performed badly in Riak 2.0. This talk looks at the original naive implementation and shows a new approach to designing CRDTs into Riak from the ground up that comes with a great deal more scale and performance.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\nIllustrate the engineering challenges inherent in taking research papers into a real world product. Both a cautionary tale and a showcase of our recent work.\n\nTarget audience:\n\nSoftware engineers. Distributed systems enthusiasts, researchers who work with industry, and practitioners interested in research. Riak users."
