description: "BY: LAUREN TAN\n\nIn the dark ages of web development, designing a beautiful user experience meant having to constantly fight with the DOM to get it to do what you want, when you want. With Ember, we no longer have to struggle with managing DOM state, and we are free to put the user experience first with reactive UI.\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss the ways in which Ember makes it easy to build delightful and reactive user experiences, and how you can build reusable components that even non-technical designers can learn to use. Learn about the thoughtful touches and interactions you can add to an Ember app.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/GO1N/"
