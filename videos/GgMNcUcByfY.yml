description: "Java 8 has been there for a while but still not everybody is using it. It brought us some 'life changing' new code constructions. Now it is time to look back and evaluate wat java 8 brought us in practice. With great syntax possibilities you can still write utterly ugly code.What is a good way to use Java 8 syntax? How functional is Java 8 really and is Optional the life saver some people promised it to be?\n\n# Brian Vermeer\nSoftware Engineer for Blue4IT working consultancy based on mainly Java projects for the Top-100 companies in the Netherlands.
