If possible showing a demoreal-time and \"open discussion\" about improvement on going, visualisationusage etc...\n\nSince some years now, the particularity of Twitter is to be \"reactive\" or realtime compare to other Social Network.\n\nThe massive stream of data generated by some events (going from Tv shows tomore serious event) can't be digested with traditional tools (Twittdecketc...). The visual representation of a twitter activity could help to revealinsights on a running topic. Graph allows to contextualize and visualise theinteraction between users and thematic within this topic.\n\nTo do that, the Twitter Stream Importer brings tools to start tracking a topicand visualise data with different \"Network logic\" that act like a particularprojection of the data. The integration within Gephi then, makes easy to usethe integrated tools (statistics, filter, exports) to works easily on yousubject.\n\nWe will see what are the main concept, what are the pro and cons and thefollowing evolution of the plugin.\n\n\nRoom: H.2214\nScheduled start: 2017-02-04 11:30:00"
