Support the show by becoming a Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/funfunfunction\n\nToday, we’re going to explore the power of declarative programming, which React has managed to popularize, and it’s incredibly useful and important for almost all programmers. Don’t worry if you’re not a web developer, this episode is not web specific, and there is not going to be much code in this episode, and I’m not going to assume that you know what React is.\n\n?  mpj on Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/mpjme"
