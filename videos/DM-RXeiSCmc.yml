description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nC++11 introduced Variadic Templates, constexpr Functions and Literal Types that ease and allow type-safe computations at compile time. For embedded development this is an important aspect, because it provides a means to create ROMable data in type-safe C++. \n\nIn combination with C++14 mechanism of Variable Templates, that actually defines constants, and the relaxed constexpr function rules there are unprecedented possibilities for compile-time computations.\n\nThis talk does not only show the mechanisms available but also demonstrates non-trivial examples, how they can be used to compute interesting data at compile time.\n— \nProf. Peter Sommerlad is director of IFS Institute for Software at FHO HSR Rapperswil where he inspired the C++ IDE Cevelop. Peter is co-author of the books POSA Vol.1 and Security Patterns. His goal is to make software simpler by Decremental Development: Refactoring software down to 10% its size with better architecture, testability and quality and functionality. Peter is a member of the C++ standardization committee, ACCU, ACM, IEEE Computer Society.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
