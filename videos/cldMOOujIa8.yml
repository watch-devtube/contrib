description: "There is a lot of talk in modern teams about experimentation. Classically an experiment is a very structured series of activities designed to find something out. Sounds a lot like testing and is in direct alignment with the concepts around TDD, BDD and ATDD. This session will discuss how we design testing experiments that are valuable and provide the right insights to the right people, at the right time.\n\nThis talk covers:\n\nWhat is an experiment?\n\nWhy do we experiment?\n\nHow are testing and experimentation aligned?\n\nHow do we structure testing experiments?\n\nHow we do learn and adjust based on the findings – pass or fail!"
