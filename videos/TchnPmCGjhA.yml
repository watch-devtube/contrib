description: "Erlang User Conference 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2013/talks \n\nThe introduction of Smalltalk in the mid 1970s ushered in a series of thought experiments that would eventually popularize the object oriented programming model with several of the most successful languages of all time. At the peak of popularity, object oriented programming in C++ and Java has changed the way we code, the way we visualize problems, and even the way we think. Not all of the changes have been for the better. This talk seeks to crystallize the problems with the object oriented languages and programming model. It also will explore specific ways that other languages remedy these problems. We'll see examples in Java, Ruby, Scala, Clojure, Erlang, and Haskell."
