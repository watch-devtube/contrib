description: "TypeScript is quickly becoming the dominant way to write maintainable self documenting JavaScript.\n\nThis session will demonstrate some of the reasons why you should consider adding TypeScript to your JavaScript toolset. This will be followed by a tour of the new features that can help catch JavaScript bugs before they make their way to production. Since TypeScript is fast evolving (just like JavaScript) we will also cover how to keep up with the changes."
