title: 'Gov 2.0 Summit 2010: Jennifer Pahlka, "A New Spirit of Public Service"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1284035760
description: "A new survey commissioned by the Center for American Progress found that young Americans age 18 to 32 give the government more positive performance ratings and more strongly favor a significant role for government in addressing national challenges than does the public at large. Millennials' distinctly pro-government outlook may well be a leading indicator of a nascent rebound in public confidence in government.\n\nWe'll hear about the findings in the CAP report. Then Jennifer Pahlka, founder and Executive Director of Code for America, will share some of the answers she's received to the question \"Why do you want to spend a year of your life in public service\" from applications submitted by prospective Code for America Fellows.\n\nWe may feel the weight of how hard change is in government , and sometimes lose faith that it's possible, but the next generation believes it can happen and is expecting us to do something about it. They're also expecting us to let them do something about it. They can see what's wrong very clearly. And unlike past generations, they care about government and collective good. Let's either rise to the challenge they are offering, or get out of the way and let them do it."
