They have the potential to revolutionize how we C++ developers work with asynchronous operations, both in terms of consuming long-running operations and in formalizing the way in which asynchronous operations are described by the developer and implemented by the compiler.\n\nThe theory is interesting, and \"Hello, World\" examples are fun, but how does the proposed coroutines feature fare when applied to a major library or operating system? How well does the coroutines feature work in practice with real-world user interface code and background tasks? \n\nIn this session, we'll explore the application of the C++ coroutines feature to C++ for the Windows Runtime. We'll look at the coroutine types that we designed for the \"C++/WinRT\" language projection, with a focus on their usability and performance. Most importantly, we'll look at how coroutines can be used with a sophisticated platform library and discover how various problems are greatly simplified in the face of real platform complexities like UI and threading models.\n— \nKenny Kerr\nMicrosoft\nKenny Kerr is an engineer on the Windows team at Microsoft, an MSDN Magazine contributing editor, Pluralsight author, and creator of moderncpp.com (C++/WinRT).
