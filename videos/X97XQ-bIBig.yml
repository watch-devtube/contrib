description: "From the 2014 Strata Conference + Hadoop World in New York City, Rana El Kaliouby's keynote \"The Power of Emotions: When Big Data meets Emotion Data.\"\n\nEmotions drive every aspect of our lives – from our health and wellbeing to our actions and decisions. For the first-time ever, we are now able to capture consumer emotions globally and at scale, allowing us to answer questions such as: are women really more expressive than men, which country smiles the most, what drives virality in video and which emotions in advertisements increase product sales. Millions of emotion data points also present a unique opportunity to improve a machine’s ability to read human emotions. This keynote will share insights from the world’s largest repository of consumer emotions and present the challenges and opportunities that this data presents for machine learning as well as data mining and visualization.\n\nAbout Rana El Kaliouby:\nRana el Kaliouby, Ph.D., is the Chief Science Officer and Co-founder of Affectiva, the leading experts in consumer emotion analytics and insights.
