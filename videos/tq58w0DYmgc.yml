description: "Docker is awesome, but how to use it well when doing Java development ?\n\nIn this talk you will get a quick introduction on how to use Docker effectively, especially for Java EE development. We will show how the recent release of Eclipse Mars supports Docker to make it even more integrated into your day-to-day work from within your IDE.

And more !"
