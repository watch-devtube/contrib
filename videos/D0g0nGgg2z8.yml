description: "The influence of Internet of Things is such that all researches are aligned in prediction that it will fundamentally change the world we are living in.\nRegardless it's still in its infancy, IoT impact is growing quickly. The new rule for the future is going to be, “anything that can be connected, will be connected\".\nPer last McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) research, over the next decade, number of connected devices is expected to increase dramatically, with estimates ranging from 25 billion to 50 billion devices in 2025, generating value between $3.9 trillion to $11.1 trillion per year.\nIntroduction of IoT systems into the homes, cities, factories, and other settings could create value in new ways and to alter how people live and work. This will affect the full range of stakeholders and will enable new business models, including those that monetize the data generated by IoT technology. \nGovernments, policy makers and businesses have the chance to accelerate the enormous opportunities associated with the IoT.\nThe presentation describes the current state of IoT, basic motivations and some predictions regarding the IoT future, but most importantly tries to stimulate the audience to reflect on their future role in IoT world."
