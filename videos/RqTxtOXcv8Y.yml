description: "https://2018.jsconf.is/speakers/david-khourshid/\n\nAs the number of possible states in your app grows, developing UIs can become exponentially more complex. With the help of finite automata, or finite state machines (FSMs), you will be able to manage your app's states in a simple, robust way, and even visualize them! In this session, we will discover how FSMs and statecharts can take your UIs to the next level, with innovative techniques for implementing, testing, and visualizing your app's finite states in a robust, automated way, with plenty of use cases, demos, and resources."
