title: 'Interactive C# Development with Roslyn - Filip W'
recordingDate: 1506326677
description: "It’s fair to say that most software developers value very highly the productivity boost that comes with being able to work in a development environment that provides a real-time feedback loop. Historically, C# has been far from that - as typically developers had to rebuild their projects after every change, and the process of finding issues in the code has always felt extremely heavy.\n\nRoslyn compiler and latest Visual Studio introduced a lot exciting tools, improvements and APIs that help in this area. In this talk, we will look at various techniques to leverage these interactive capabilities. We’ll look at the REPL and Interactive Window, scripting APIs, live Roslyn analyzers, a much improved Edit-and-Continue support and interactive testing, all of which will hopefully help your development workflow be much more productive."
