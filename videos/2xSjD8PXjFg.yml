description: "Robert \"Uncle Bob\" Martin created an ethical framework for developers called “The Programmer’s Oath.”\n\nIn this video, Uncle Bob explains the 9 promises of his Programmer’s Oath. Here they are:\n\n1. I will not produce harmful code.\n2. The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.\n3. I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.\n4. I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.\n5. I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.\n6. I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.\n7. I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.\n8. I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty.\n9. I will never stop learning and improving my craft.\n\nRobert Martin (Uncle Bob) (https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin) has been a programmer since 1970. He is co-founder of the on-line video training company: https://cleancoders.com and founder of Uncle Bob Consulting LLC: https://cleancoder.com\n\nSpecial thanks to Uncle Bob for creating this video exclusively for our channel.\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.org\n\nAnd subscribe for new videos on technology every day: https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=freecodecamp"
