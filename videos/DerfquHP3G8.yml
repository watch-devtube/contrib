description: 'Groovy is a great language with a lot of features. We use many of these features in our day-to-day programming live, like the excellent collections API. But some of the features are like hidden gems. We take a look at the more less known features of Groovy. Collection methods we might not use every day, but can be useful to know about. We take a look at other great features of the Groovy language using Groovy Console as our editor. We use real code samples to learn about the great features of Groovy. The talk is based on the Groovy Goodness series on the blog ''Messages from mrhaki''.'
