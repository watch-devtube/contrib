Intelligent objects, things that respond to motion, light, sound, touch, warmth. Such objects can bodily exists in the environment as we do. They provoke to certain actions, change human behaviour, are natural in use, harmoniously embedded in our environment and adjusted to our needs. They become kind of social actor.
