description: "California ideology has undoubtedly changed the way the world looks at technology and business. Silicon Valley has spawned its own stepchildren in Europe like “Silicon Allee” and “Silicon Roundabout”. Lately, Silicon Valley has come under criticism for its ethics, social irresponsibility, hyper-capitalistic values, and spending millions of dollars funding apps like “Yo”. How did we get here?\n\nMy talk will give a brief history of Silicon Valley so we can learn from the past and create a new future. What can we learn from its roots in the LSD-dropping, commune-living hippies that set out to decentralize power and empower the individual?\n\nTranscript: http://2014.jsconf.eu\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
