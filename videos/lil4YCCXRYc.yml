title: 'Jafar Husain: Async Programming in ES7 | JSConf US 2015'
language: English
recordingDate: 1434984371
description: "Currently there are ES7 features proposed for async programming that have never been seen in a programming language before. If accepted, these proposals could allow entire JS applications to be written without a single callback! By providing the same level of support for async functions as regular functions, ES7 could dramatically alter the way everyday developers write code. Imagine reading data from a stream or a web socket with a simple loop. Imagine catching async errors using try/catch, and never again finding yourself in the callback pyramid of doom.\n\nTranscript: https://gist.github.com/voodootikigod/74935e99334367e2c09c"
