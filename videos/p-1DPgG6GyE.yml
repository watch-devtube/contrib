description: "he Hibernate project is no longer tied exclusively to relational databases. Over the past ten years the Hibernate community has been forging Hibernate Search and then more recently Hibernate OGM.\n\nThese new components are deeply integrated with the world famous Hibernate ORM layer, and allow you to easily bridge the chasm between your Domain Model and NoSQL databases and high performance full-text indexes.\n\nI’ll give an overview of these projects, their architectures, and finally show a demo of how you could adapt any JPA based application to store data in a MongoDB database, run queries on Elasticsearch, use a distributed real time cache like Infinispan, while actually not changing much code at all."
