recordingDate: 1474443314
description: "The ability to focus on code and code alone is the holy grail of programmer productivity. So we have Scrum, Kanban, bug trackers, instant messengers, todo lists and task boards that *in theory* should help us focus on code. But more often than not they don't.\nIn \"Time to Code\", Kees Jan dissects distraction. Using well-known models he explains what it is that distracts from coding. He then looks at the methods and thinking behind the tools and how they *should* help you focus.\nYou walk away with better insight into the visible and invisible distractions that sit between you and your code. Kees Jan gives you some simple changes for you to make that will reduce distraction and give you more time to work on code."
