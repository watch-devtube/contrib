title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Principles of Content Layout'
recordingDate: 1523471688
description: "Every website is ultimately valued for its content. But once you have the content, how do you convince people to read it? How do you best support the reader, control the flow of their content experience, and direct them to the actions that are most important to you?\n\nTo solve these problems\_you need a solid layout strategy, supported by design principles that existed long before websites.\n\nWe'll briefly go over the history of page layout design going back over a century, then come\_back\_to modern times and current trends in website layout. Finally, we'll use the upcoming Layout Builder in Drupal 8 to create a page putting these design principles into action."
