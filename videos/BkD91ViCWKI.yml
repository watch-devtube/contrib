title: 'Using JavaScript/HTML5 Rich Clients with Java EE 7'
language: English
recordingDate: 1502024411
description: "The sea change in HTML5 is poised to shift the pendulum away from today's thin-client based server-side web frameworks like Struts 2 and JSF to JavaScript powered rich clients. With strong support for REST, WebSocket and JSON, Java EE is well positioned to adapt to this landscape. In this heavily code driven session, we will show you how you can utilize today's most popular JavaScript rich client technologies like AngularJS, Backbone, Knockout and Ember to utilize the core strengths of Java EE using JAX-RS, JSR 356/WebSocket, JSON-P, CDI and Bean Validation. The talk will use WebLogic for it's demos.\n\nReza Rahman\nConsultant\nIndependent"
