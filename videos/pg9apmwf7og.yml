description: "This live session will focus on the details of music generation using the Tensorflow library. The goal is for you to understand the details of how to encode music, feed it to a well tuned model, and use it to generate really cool sounds. And I'm going to NOT use Google Hangouts, instead I'll do this with a green screen and a DSLR camera :)\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/music_demo_live/\n\nPlease subscribe!
