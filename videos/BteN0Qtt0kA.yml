description: "We are drowning in data. Every two days we generate more data than the entirety of human history up to 2003. And those are old numbers. We have scientific instruments that generate more data than we can store, much less process. And we have data on everything you can possibly dream of – and in the case of Facebook, many things you’d probably prefer not to. In short, we have more data than we can possibly begin to understand.\n\nCoincidentally, we have an entire cohort of school students who we are failing to engage with technology. Students whose experience of “tech” subjects is formatting word documents or making web pages. Students who don’t see the relevance of technology to their own lives and careers. We are increasingly ruling their world with data. It’s time to engage them with it. Citizen Data Science has potential to enable students to make scientific discoveries, understand the discipline that’s changing the face of the world, and engage with technology on a whole new level. I’m going to show you how.\n\n\nDr Linda McIver started out as an Academic with a PhD in Computer Science Education. When it became apparent that High School teaching was a lot more fun, Linda began a highly successful career at John Monash Science School, where she built innovative courses in Computational and Data Science for year 10 and year 11 students.\n\nNominated one of the inaugural Superstars of STEM in 2017, Linda is passionate about creating authentic project experiences to motivate all students to become technologically and data literate.\n\nWhile Linda loves the classroom, it was rapidly becoming clear that teachers in the Australian School system were keen to embrace Data Science, but that there was a serious lack of resources to support that. That’s why Linda created ADSEI – to support Data Science in education."
