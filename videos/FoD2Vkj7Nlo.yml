description: "by Richard Brown\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.3.401/opensuse_kubic.webm\n\n\nAs the world moves more and more towards containerised solutions, a number of real questions start to appear.\n- What is the perfect platform for running containers atop?\n- How to use this platform as part of a flexible, scalable, highly available infrastructure fabric?\n- How to minimize the maintenance and administration of this platform at scale? \n\nAll of these problems are well answered in an enterprise environment by SUSE CaaS Platform, but for developers more interested in the state of containers &amp; kubernetes upstream, new issues start to appear. With such fast moving upstreams, developers and enthusiasts need a platform that can keep up and is closely involved with those upstream developments. This platform needs to not only be able to run containers at scale, but also on single machine, all the while preserving the attributes of low maintenance so the focus can be on the containers, not the base system beneath them. \n\nThis talk will introduce openSUSE Kubic, and explains how it addresses the above, being the perfect distribution for this modern age. The session will explore in some detail how Kubic is developed in lockstep with the Tumbleweed rolling release and various upstreams including kubeadm and CRI-O. Transactional Updates, Kubic's system update stack will be demonstrated and the benefits from such an atomic update approach discussed in some detail. Finally the kubeadm Kubernetes cluster boostrapping tool will be discussed and some future plans shared for consideration and feedback. \n\nAttendees should come away from this talk with everything they need to know to get starting using, developing with and contributing to openSUSE Kubic. \n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 11:55:00+01"
