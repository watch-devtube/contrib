description: "This talk will emphasize that “size isn’t everything” and that what is the “right size” very much depends on your specific circumstances. Within that context, we will discuss developing Java EE “Right Size” services with WildFly Swarm, while providing various diverse demonstrations on how WildFly Swarm works and its ease of use.\n\nIf you’re an experienced Java EE company, and you’ve been thinking about investigating microservices, that doesn’t have to mean doing away with Java EE. We will show how WildFly Swarm can construct a single Jar containing a Java EE Application along with any WildFly components your Java EE Application would require. These can be deployed easily and quickly to any environment with a JVM.\n\nWe will finish by going beyond Java EE and exploring non Java EE technologies that WildFly Swarm has integrated with, such as Netflix Ribbon, Swagger, and Jolokia, that ease development for highly distributed applications intended for “cloud first” deployments.\n\nHeiko Braun is a Principal Software Engineer for Red Hat with 18 years of experience in the industry. In recent years he did focus on large scale open source software solutions. In particular Java middleware components (J2EE) and tools and frameworks for enterprise systems integration (Web Services, BPEL, SOA, BPM).\n\nDimitris Andreadis is the Engineering Manager of the WildFly / JBoss Enterprise Application Server team at Red Hat. He served as the JBoss AS project lead for several years and he has been a JBoss addict and contributor from the early start-up days. He worked previously at Intracom and Motorola in the areas of NMS/OSS, designing reusable frameworks and distributed systems. Dimitris studied computer science at the Technological Educational Institute of Athens and received an M.Sc. by research from University College Dublin, Ireland.\n\n[WMP-8487]"
