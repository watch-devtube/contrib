description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune 23, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLow cost clusters are usually built from commodity parts and use standard transport protocols like TCP/IP.  Once systems become large enough, reliability and fault tolerance become an important issue and TCP/IP often requires additional mechanisms to ensure reliability of the application. The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a newly standardized transport protocol that provides additional mechanisms for reliability beyond that of TCP.  The added reliability and fault tolerance of SCTP may function better for MapReduce-like distributed applications on large commodity clusters.  SCTP has the following features that provide additional levels of..."
