recordingDate: 1536060134
description: "As a system architect and solution provider I work with many technologies , like recently mobile integrations, API management and cloud based solutions. I have a true passion for software development and architecture, but also for hang gliding and trail running. As the ultra trail race Kullamannen is around the corner I work on my trail assistant that uses machine learning in node to predict running parameters, a work in progress.\n\nTrail running assistant\n\nThis presentation will be a practical approach to how you can use neural networks for something real. I will demonstrate how I use Synaptic library in node to ”predict” what kind of running I am currently doing, as well as giving you some experience and thoughts on Neural Networks as I train my network and finally demonstrate a mocked up trail run in Palma, Mallorca. This talk will not be about the algorithms, ideology or mathematics, it will be a practical demo of a real world application.\n__________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
