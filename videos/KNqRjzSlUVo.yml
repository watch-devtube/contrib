Such things often stem from the \"wisdom of the ancients\" (although computer science being young as sciences come, some of the \"ancients\" are still among us and thriving today, and we're so lucky to have them!), and are in effect part of our \"myths\".\n\nHowever, being as grounded in the science-that-there-was as these recommendations are, our ideas have evolved, so have our programming languages, and it can be interesting to revisit some of these taken-for-granted ideas.\n\nIn C++, particularly in what some call \"modern C++\", we find a language that is different enough from its forebears to make revisiting our \"myths\" interesting. How do such things as \"goto considered harmful\" or \"only one return per function\", for example, hold as \"wisdom\" with respect to modern C++? Do they still help us write better programs or should be rethink them under the light of modern languages and practice?\n\nThe aim of this talk is to examine what some commonly heard recommendations or advices with respect to programming practice mean in the context of \"modern\" C++. We will take a small set of such advices, present them in context, show how well (or how badly) they suit today's C++, and try to rephrase them if this seems advantageous.\n— \nPatrice Roy\nUniversité de Sherbrooke\nProfessor\nSherbrooke (Québec), Canada\n\nPatrice Roy has been playing with C++, either professionally, for pleasure or (most of the time) both for over 25 years. After a few years doing R&D and working on military flight simulators, he moved on to academics and has been teaching computer science since 1998. Since 2005, he’s been involved more specifically in helping graduate students and professionals from the fields of real-time systems and game programming develop the skills they need to face today’s challenges. The rapid evolution of C++ in recent years has made his job even more enjoyable. He’s been a participating member in the ISO C++ Standards Committee since late 2014 and has been involved with the ISO Programming Language Vulnerabilities Committee since late 2015. He has five kids, and his wife ensures their house is home to a continuously changing number of cats, dogs and other animals.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
