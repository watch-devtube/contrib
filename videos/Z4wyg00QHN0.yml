description: "Join Richard Campbell as he tells his story of software, hardware and charity that ultimately has led him to the Humanitarian Toolbox (htbox.org).\nThe Humanitarian Toolbox is an open source initiative to build software for disaster relief – both for the Non-Governmental Organizations that are involved in disaster relief, the citizen volunteers that donate their time to assist during a disaster and the disaster victims themselves. Richard will take you along on his journey of experiences with technology over several decades to show how you can help change the world with software."
