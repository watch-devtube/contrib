title: 'ElixirConf 2021 - Sophi DeBenedetto - An Elixir Adoption Success Story'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635005364
description: 'Adopting a new language is more than just a technical journey. A language is only the right tool for the job if your engineers can wield it well. So, as a technical leader you don’t just select a language or a framework based on its technical capabilities and how suited it is for the problems you need to solve, you also try to optimize for the skills your team already has, for a robust ecosystem surrounding that language, for strong community support, and so much more. Elixir lays claim to all of these features and I’ve seen teams ramp up on Elixir with astonishing speed, delivering robust, high-value projects to their organizations in record time. Don’t believe me? I’ll walk you through one such success story in which a small team of engineers who were mostly new to Elixir managed to over-deliver on a complex project in just three months. You’ll learn why we chose Elixir, how Elixir enabled us to be successful, and some of the practices and techniques that will help your own team adopt Elixir.'
