description: "ServerlessDays Paris - https://paris.serverlessdays.io\n\nIn the serverless community, individuals and teams spend a lot of time and effort attempting to build an environment that is a replica of the cloud. Why? Because this is what we have always done. I am going to argue that this not only unnecessary in the serverless world but actually harmful.\n\n\nAbout Gareth\n\nA web developer of nearly 20 years; from humble beginnings doing a lot of work in multiple teams around South Africa and ending up in Portugal with his family, Gareth has seen the industry shift repeatedly from one paradigm to the next. After discovering the world of Serverless Gareth now finds himself lucky enough to work with the team at Serverless Inc, custodians of the open source Serverless Framework, as a Customer Success Engineer and Developer Advocate. On the off days he spends as much as he can with his wife and children."
