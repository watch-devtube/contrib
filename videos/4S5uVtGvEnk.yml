description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nProduction issues aren't an easy thing to learn to deal with. Yammer went from having one person on-call, to having the whole engineering team taking ownership of their code and services in production. This talk goes over what things worked, and what didn't, to get us there."
