description: "We do like our Holy Wars, don't we? — tables vs CSS? Responsive vs mdot? React vs Angular? CSS or CSS-in-JS? Let's look at the real issue: getting the free and open web to the other 4 billion people.\n\nBruce has been working on the web since 2002. He was a member of the Web Standards Project on the authoring committee of BS8878, the British Standard for commissioning accessible websites, helped develop HTML responsive images, was on the W3C Mobile Web Apps Best Practices Working Group, and co-authored \"Introducing HTML5\", the first full-length book on the subject. He was Deputy CTO of Opera Software until 2016, and now helps Wix Engineering with web standards and products.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 27 January 2018\n\nSource: https://2018.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
