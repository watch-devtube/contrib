title: 'DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Your API is a UI'
recordingDate: 1462909467
description: "Whether you're creating a complex web application or a simple library, everything you create has a user. Why, then, do we concentrate on our users when developing a user interface, but so often forget them when developing APIs? In this talk, Christopher presents a whirlwind overview of a variety of different User Experience considerations when designing your APIs.\n\nWhy should attendees see this talk?\n\nAs developers, we're always creating APIs - whether they are libraries, a common set of functions or web services. This talk presents a relatively novel way of looking at an API - by applying UX considerations to our technical designs, and thinking of the end users, we can create better APIs that noone swears at...\n\nThis talk has been seen in 2015 at PHPUK, EndpointCon and Northeast PHP 2015, where it received 4- and 5-star ratings on Joind.in."
