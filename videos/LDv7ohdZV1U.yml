title: 'Linux Security APIs and the Chromium Sandbox - Patricia Aas'
recordingDate: 1539186516
description: "The Linux Security and Isolation APIs have become the basis of some of the most useful features server-side, providing the isolation required for efficient containers. However, these APIs also form the basis of the Chromium Sandbox on Linux, and we will study them in that context.\nThe Chromium Sandbox is used in the Vivaldi, Brave, Chrome and Opera browsers among others. It has a very platform specific implementation, using the platform APIs available to construct it. In this talk we will describe the requirements of the Chromium Sandbox and go through the steps and APIs used to construct it on Linux.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences \nhttps://ndctechtown.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
