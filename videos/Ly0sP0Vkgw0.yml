description: "Google Tech Talks\nAugust 16, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe Internet went well beyond a technology artefact, increasingly becoming a social interaction tool. These interactions are usually complex and hard to analyze automatically, demanding the research and development of novel data mining techniques that handle the individual characteristics of each application scenario. Notice that these data mining techniques, similarly to other machine learning techniques, are intensive in terms of both computation and I/O, motivating the development of new paradigms, programming environments, and parallel algorithms that support scalable and efficient applications. In this talk we present some results that justify not..."
