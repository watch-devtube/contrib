description: "Deep Dive: CNCF Storage WG - Alex Chircop, StorageOS & Quinton Hoole, Huawei \n\nThe CNCF Storage Working Group has been exploring how different storage technologies are used in cloud-native environments, and has published a draft white paper on our findings.  In this deep dive session we'll present our work thus far, and host detailed discussions and feedback covering topics including block stores, file systems, object stores, key-value stores and databases, amongst others. Common understandings of terminology, classifications and use cases will be discussed. Different architectural approaches and designs will be brainstormed and compared in terms of key attributes like availability, scalability, performance, data consistency, durability, fault tolerance, ease of development and operational complexity. We seek to align the community on common understanding, terminology, classifications and use cases. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GreV"
