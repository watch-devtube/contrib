description: "It is no surprise that reducing operational IT expenditures and increasing software capabilities is a top priority for large enterprises. Given its advantages, open source software has proliferated across the globe. While there’s been much discussion on open source versus commercial, CIOs and CTOs at Global 1000 enterprises are increasingly interested in solutions that blend the benefits of both. However, key challenges must be overcome. Enterprise architecture groups are now faced with the difficult task of selecting the right open source software components from an ever-growing set of options, figuring out how to integrate them, and ensuring they work together.\n\nRon Bodkin explains how Teradata drives open source adoption inside enterprises through a range of initiatives, from direct contributions to open source projects designed to address key enterprise requirements to orchestration software that integrates Hadoop with other components of the analytical ecosystem, providing enterprises with the technical expertise required to fully leverage the benefits of open source in their analytical ecosystem.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Teradata.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
