description: "Get the Cheat Sheet: http://goo.gl/OI9DU\n\nI have been asked many times to cover the Eclipse shortcut keys that I use all of the time, so in this tutorial I will do just that. I did my best to limit the tutorial to the most commonly used shortcuts I use so that they are easier to memorize. I also provide them in a table below.\n\nBoth the Auto Complete and the Keystroke shortcuts are covered. I hope this helps you write code quicker. Feel free to leave your own favorites in the comment section below if you think I missed something important."
