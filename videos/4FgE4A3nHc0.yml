description: 'I would like to review and compare most common approaches/frameworks to adopt CDC for java apps – Spring Cloud Contract and Pact(java/groovy). While a lot of teams started documenting and exposing their API, Consumer Driven Contracts are not that widely supported. At the same time, they can bring a lot of benefit for organisations that are transforming towards microservice architecture and where a good level of communication has been established across teams.'
