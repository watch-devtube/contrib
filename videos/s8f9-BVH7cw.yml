description: "Spring I/O 2018 - Barcelona, 24-25 May\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/mp911de/under-the-hood-of-reactive-data-access-1\n\nGitHub repo: https://github.com/mp911de/under-the-hood-reactive\n\nA huge theme in Spring Framework 5.0 and its ecosystem projects is the native reactive support that empowers you to build end-to-end reactive applications. Reactive data access especially requires a reactive infrastructure. But how is this one different from the ones used before? How does it deal with I/O?\n\nIn this session, we will demystify what happens inside the driver and give you a better understanding of their capabilities. You will learn about the inner mechanics of reactive data access by walking through reactive drivers that are used in Spring Data."
