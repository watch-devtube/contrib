description: "Gerard K. Cohen: Starting a new project and selecting from the latest UI frameworks is a challenging experience. How do you know the one\nyou choose is accessible?\n\nWe will begin by evaluating just a few of the more popular frameworks, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Foundation, jQuery/ jQuery UI, and do an apples to apples comparison of some common elements, widgets, and patterns by reviewing real code examples and UI framework documentation. We will test for focus management, keyboard interaction, color contrast, and proper ARIA usage. After evaluating the various frameworks and their elements, widgets, and patterns for accessibility we will have a good idea of how each framework rates on the accessibility scale based on its strengths and weaknesses. We will then discuss what is needed in order to make everything progressively accessible.\n\nhttp://forwardjs.com"
