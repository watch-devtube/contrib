description: "Terraforming Jupyter: Changing JupyterLab to suit your needs\nStephanie Stattel (Bloomberg LP), Paul Ivanov (Bloomberg LP)\n\nAs the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter, JupyterLab is at its core an extensible environment. JupyterLab extensions can be created to modify themes, menu items, and keyboard shortcuts, as well as broader-scoped extensions, like ipywidgets that bring additional functionality like interactive HTML widgets to the notebook. JupyterLab extensions in turn can be extended and provide APIs and dependencies for other extensions.\n\nStephanie Stattel and Paul Ivanov discuss the evolution of the JupyterLab architecture, which is itself simply a collection of extensions that can be customized to create tailored, opinionated Jupyter environments, and walk you through a series of JupyterLab extensions that demonstrate the power and flexibility of this new architecture. For each example, they highlight the relative complexity and stability of the extension itself. They also explore how different extensions can be combined to create customized environments.\n\nTopics include:\n\nMenu customization\nLayout customization\nTheming customization\nFile browser customization\nExtension enablement and management\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
