description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nFred George - Co-Founder of Outpace Systems, Programmer Anarchy\n\nABSTRACT\nProgrammer Anarchy is a post­Agile process that focuses on empowering programmers by eliminating roles that interfere with domain knowledge and assumption of day­to­day decisions by the programmers. Originally conceived in a startup environment at Forward Internet Group in London, Programmer Anarchy is now being implemented in a traditional IT shop for an established company: MailOnline, the online newspaper arm of the Daily Mail of London. This discussion will talk about the introduction of Anarchy into a Scrum shop, the training, the transition of roles, and the redesign of HR roles. \n\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
