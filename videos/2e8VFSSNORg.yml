description: "Relational programming, or logic programming, is a paradigm that exhibits remarkable and powerful properties, to the extent that its implementation seems frightfully daunting to the layman. ?Kanren is a minimal relational language that seeks to strip the paradigm down to its core, leaving us with a succinct and elegant set of primitives on top of which we can rebuild even the most powerful relational constructs.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore the ?Kanren language by implementing it from first principles in a simple functional programming language, going on to demonstrate how you can assemble these simple building blocks into a semblance of its richer parent, miniKanren, and maybe solve a logic puzzle or two to make sure it's working as advertised.\n\nThe ?Kanren paper, and the original ?Kanren implementation, were authored by Jason Hemann and Daniel P. Friedman. The paper is available at http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf, and the Scheme implementation at https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren"
