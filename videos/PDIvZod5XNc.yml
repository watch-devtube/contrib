title: 'Sync & Swim With CouchDB For Mac & iOS'
recordingDate: 1321337548
description: "This talk introduces CouchDB and Couchbase Mobile to Mac and iOS developers who are looking for a way to synchronize app data between mobile devices, desktop computers and the cloud. I'll describe CouchDB and its elegant NoSQL \"property-lists on steroids\" approach to data storage; explain how replication and synchronization are built into it at a fundamental level; show some different topologies that can be used for different types of sync; and cover the basics of building Couchbase Mobile into your app.\n\nAbout Jens Alfke:\n\nJens Alfke is a Mobile Engineering Peer at Couchbase, Inc. where he's developing Couchbase Mobile for iOS. He has a long history as a Mac developer and spent 15 years at Infinite Loop working on everything from AppleScript and Stickies to iChat and Safari RSS, followed by two years at Google and RockMelt extending the Chrome browser. He's an avid proponent of decentralized social software, despite never having managed to release any. In his spare time he pretends to be a DJ, and cuts things out of plastic with lasers."
