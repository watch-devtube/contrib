description: "Google Tech Talks\nSeptember,  5 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nStatistical language processing tools are being applied to an\never-wider and more varied range of linguistic data. Researchers and\nengineers are using statistical models to organize and understand\nfinancial news, legal documents, biomedical abstracts, and weblog\nentries, among many other domains. Because language varies so widely,\ncollecting and curating training sets for each different domain is\nprohibitively expensive. At the same time, differences in vocabulary\nand writing style across domains can cause state-of-the-art supervised\nmodels to dramatically increase in error.\n\nThis talk describes structural correspondence learning (SCL), a method\nfor..."
