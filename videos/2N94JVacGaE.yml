Search engines are used to find relevance in vast volumes of data; however, until recently, they could only do basic data analysis. We will investigate new features recently added to Apache Solr that make search an attractive option for data scientists. The talk will focus on the Solr Analytics Component and other complementary features offered by Solr.\n\nThis talk is presented by Bloomberg."
