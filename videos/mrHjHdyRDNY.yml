description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nLinda Rising - Queen of Patterns & Author of Numerous Books\n\nABSTRACT\nThose of us who struggle with complex problems for a living, unfortunately, don't have time to keep up with the enormous amount of research in cognitive science that would help us be better thinkers. Linda Rising will share one small but important bit of advice that she has uncovered--the power of movement. Some of what she will say will be surprising, even counterintuitive. Linda will report on the research and provide some tips for better thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
