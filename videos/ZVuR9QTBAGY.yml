title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Building amazing searches with Search API'
recordingDate: 1506509409
description: "A quick, hands-on walk through the Search API ecosystem in Drupal 8: How to set things up, what you can do, what to keep in mind, what to avoid.\nMake your site search amazing, too!\n\nWHAT'S THE SEARCH API?\n\nFirst created for Drupal 7, the Search API module provides a powerful, extensible framework for creating searches in Drupal. Along with its numerous extension modules it allows site builders to enrich their searches with any number of advanced features, and vastly improve the relevancy and presentation of the delivered results compared to the default \"Search\" module provided with Drupal Core.\n\nWhile not all of the extension modules have been ported to Drupal 8 yet, the Search API itself and several other modules working with it are already usable or even considered stable – enough to make amazing searches in Drupal 8, too!\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT\n\nWhile this session will also include some background information, it will mainly consist of a live demonstration of how to set up the Search API with various extension modules, of the kind of searches and functionality you can create with those, and also contain some tips and warnings that might be helpful when using this modules on your own site.\n\nCovered modules will include:\n\nSearch API (duh)\nSearch API Solr Search\nSearch API Multilingual Solr Search\nSearch API Autocomplete\nFacets\nPossibly others (depending, mostly, on their development status at the time)\nIf you want to get a more accurate feel of what to expect, check out one of my previous Search API demo sessions, like the one from DrupalCon Barcelona (2015). It will basically follow the same pattern, just updated to the latest developments in the Drupal 8 version (which have been numerous).\n\nREQUIRED KNOWLEDGE\n\nThis session is aimed at beginners, no knowledge about any of the discussed modules is required. However, it will be helpful to already be somewhat familiar with Drupal 8 and the \"Views\" module.\n\nWHO WE ARE\n\nThomas Seidl (drunken monkey) is the initial creator of the Search API and a lot of its extension modules, and continues to maintain most of them. He's been working on search modules in Drupal since 2008.\n\nMarkus Kalkbrenner (mkalkbrenner) is the maintainer of the Search API Solr backend(s) in Drupal 8. He started with Solr before their 1.0 release and has been working on its Drupal integration since Drupal 5."
