title: 'Keeping Your APIs Honest'
language: English
recordingDate: 1519801083
description: "Ever had your API documentation go out of sync with your API implementation? Or broke API clients with a refactor of your back-end code? Or maybe you deployed the wrong version of a microservice to production instead of staging... If the above sends chills down your spine, then this talk is for you! We'll learn how to use open source tooling to test your code against an API spec, during development or in production, so you can ensure your documentation stays in sync and that you don't break everyone out there that depends on your API.\n\nMy goal is to help developers build great APIs. I've been building APIs for the last decade and spent the last 3 years building API tools at Apiary as VP of Product. I'm very passionate about the Design-First approach for building APIs and love to talk about best practices and lessons learned.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/\nhttps://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
