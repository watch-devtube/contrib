description: "The web platform is a wonderful playground of artistic and technical expression. The artists of the web often release amazing creations in the most compact form. But you don't have to be a seasoned developer to express yourself and build your own animations. With a bit practice, anyone can build Audio-Visual demos!\nThis talk will go through creative coding, the demoscene, and a range of optimization tricks. Then we will work on a little Audio-Visual demo together.\n\nI hope this will inspire new JavaScript artists and bring a dash of creativity to our every day problem solving.\nMathieu 'p01' Henri is a JavaScript developer at Opera Software in Oslo, Norway, working on the desktop browser. At night he is a creative coder & demoscene artist specialized in real time audio visual animations in a few hundred bytes for the web platform, PC and Atari ST computers.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore - 20 November 2015.\n\nSource: http://2015.jsconf.asia\nMore Info: http://www.p01.org/jsconf_asia_2015/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
