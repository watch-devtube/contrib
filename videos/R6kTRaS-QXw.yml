description: "\"We're deeply sorry if you decided to deploy a new product in 2016. Not only are systems getting more and more complex, but you're spoiltby the choice between oodles of infrastructure solutions. But donot fear as Docker is here. Containerization set out to redeem you from all your ops hassle. But since there are still minor inconvenienceslike Networking, Service Discovery, Persistence of even Security to be takencare of, your job isn't done with containerizing everything. All of the aboveare fundamental architectural decisions you shouldn't approach reckless.\nWhile Hashicorp tools are no silver bullet, they allow for pragmatic solutions while you still remain at the wheel. We want to show you how to set up an infrastructure suited for modern software needs.\nDisclaimer: We're not affiliated by any means with Hashicorp. We just happen to like their tools a lot ;-)\""
