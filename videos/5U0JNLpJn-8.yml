description: "Neuroevolution is a subcategory of machine learning that applies evolutionary computation to generate artificial neural networks. Traditionally, neural networks are trained using the backpropagation algorithm. Back propagation is limited in its application, especially in scenarios where a training set of sufficient size is unavailable as in artificial life or evolutionary robotics. Backpropagation also puts a lot of constraints on the topology of the network. The number of hidden layers as well as the number of neurons per layer need to be known in advance, the activation function must be differentiable, the network must be fully connected and recurrent connections are not allowed. Neuroevolution provides an alternative approach which generates nets that don't suffer from these limitations and can evolve to any topology.\n\nMore details on website: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2017/jeroen-soeters"
