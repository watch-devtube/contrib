description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nTrisha Gee - MongoDB Inc\n\nABSTRACT\nAnyone ever give you advice on how to remain a programmer? To avoid being \"promoted\" into positions away from technology and code? Anyone ever tell you at school or university that you needed social skills to be a good developer? Did you know, without having had half a dozen different jobs, that all development roles are not created equal? Is it true that moving jobs a lot is a Bad Thing?\n\nIn this session I'm going to share some lessons I learnt the hard way while managing my career as a Java developer. I'm going to tell you secrets that others don't want to share. And I'll give you tools for working out what your next steps are.\n\nIf nothing else, you'll get to laugh at the (many) mistakes I've made in my search for The Perfect Job.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
