title: 'Clojure spec Screencast: Customizing Generators'
language: English
recordingDate: 1470850741
description: "One benefit of Clojure specs is that they automatically provide data generators that produce values conforming to the spec which can be used for testing. In addition, you can compose your own generator to more precisely match your data model.\n\nIn this screencast, Stuart Halloway demonstrates techniques for creating and combining models of your input using the `bind` and `fmap` functions to produce custom generators."
