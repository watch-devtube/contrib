description: "DevDay,\n5th October 2012, Kraków\n\n\"Javascript has traditionally been the Marmite of the development world, people either love it or hate it and there is always that one person who did a bit of jQuery last year and is therefore ambivalent about the whole thing.\n\nWhy is it so divisive? What's really so bad about the language? Do these things really get in the way of writing a good product or good software? What steps can we take to mitigate this and do we really need to worry about it so much?\""
