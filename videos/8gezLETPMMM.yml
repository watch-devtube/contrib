Thomas is originally from Germany and based in Taiwan for several years. Gandi uses Free/Open Source to provide its services. How did Gandi succeed becoming one of the top domain providers and mostly using Open Source? What technologies does Gandi.net use specifically to provide its solutions? What technologies is the company offering to its customers?\r\n\r\nWe will start with a presentation of Thomas, where he will introduce Gandi.net as well its Domain API's, Gandi's LiveDNS and how you can use your domain name. He will also outline Gandi’s Open Source strategy as a strong supporter of open source and discuss future challenges with attendees of the meetup.\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/f8JG/"
