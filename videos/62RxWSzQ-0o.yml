description: "David Gibson, Tony Aiuto,  Mark Stahl\r\n\r\nOver the past year, Google has launched several APIs, including Buzz, URL Shortener and Latitude, among others, that are built on the new API infrastructure presented at last year's I/O. We've also completely rebuilt our client libraries and have launched several new tools to help you learn about our APIs, bootstrap your development, and register your app with Google. In this session, we dive into the life of a Google API developer, covering the steps needed to develop an application on top of these new Google APIs and best practices for using them."
