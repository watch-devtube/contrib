description: "Google Tech Talks\nJanuary, 24 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nQuantum cryptography is actually about secure distribution of an encryption key between two parties. In this talk I give an introduction to practical quantum cryptography. I will describe the technical details of a few implementations, how the security of the distributed key might be compromised, and what steps can be taken to prevent this. \n\nSpeaker: Alexander Ling\nAlexander Ling is a graduate student with the Experimental Quantum Optics group in the Center for Quantum Technologies in Singapore.  He has spent the last four years building sources of high-quality polarization-entangled photon-pairs.  The entangled light is then used for various things like testing the validity of quantum mechanics and quantum key distribution.\nHe hopes to complete his Ph.D. in 4 months."
