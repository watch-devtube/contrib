description: "Building microservices with Kubernetes is fun, but deploying them by hand is not! It would be great if you could just run \"npm deploy\" and get your service deployed into a cluster. In this talk, I'll show you how to build a CI/CD pipeline that lets you test and deploy your Node.js apps into a production Kubernetes environment!\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode Summit 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nSandeep Dinesh\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNode Summit Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video."
