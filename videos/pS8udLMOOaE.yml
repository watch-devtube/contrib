recordingDate: 1369027931
description: "Ilya Grigorik, Stephen Konig \n\nWebP is a new, open-source image format which provides lossy and lossless compression of images with significant byte savings: 30-80% smaller image files when compared to jpeg and png! In this session we will cover the latest features, news, and future roadmap of the WebP format. We will  dive into a few hands-on case studies and recount how large sites and applications deployed WebP, the challenges they faced in the process, and the benefits they saw and measured after the migration. In other words, a 0-60 primer on WebP: what it is, how to get started, the tooling, and the benefits - bring your propeller hat!\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
