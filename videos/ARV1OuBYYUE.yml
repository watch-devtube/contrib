description: "Matthew Treinish\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/156/\nOne common misconception about a lot of Open Source projects is that the quality is variable and/or is of a secondary concern. This is supported to a certain degree by a lot of projects which do minimal testing upstream and rely on downstream consumers to do more thorough testing. But, there is no reason that an open project can not also do QA in the open as part of the community. While the term QA will likely evoke a plethora of negative emotions from anyone who has worked in a corporate development environment, there can be real benefits to having a dedicated QA effort on an open source project. It enables transparency in how testing is done, lets anyone contribute and collaborate, and can signal to users the stability of a project. This talk will use OpenStack as an case study to explore how an open source project can do QA in an open manner and the potential benefits it can provide."
