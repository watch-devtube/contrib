title: 'Code Reviews - Why, what and how - Arne Mertz - Meeting C++ 2017'
language: English
recordingDate: 1516959112
description: "Code reviews can be an important instrument to not only improve the quality of our code but also for knowledge transfer. They can be crucial when we develop software with a language as complex as C++ that allows solving problems in multiple different ways. Both junior and senior developers can benefit from code reviews if they are done the right way. Not every line of code needs to be reviewed though, and it is vital to project success to make code reviews efficient by focusing on the right parts of our code.\n\nIn this talk, I will lay out the different ways in which our projects and ourselves can benefit from code reviews as well as how reviews should (and should not) be done."
