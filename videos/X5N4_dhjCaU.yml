title: 'CON5394   Leveraging Java Optimizations to Improve Density in Cloud Environments'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449583089
description: "This session investigates using the existing JVM shared cache optimization in the Docker and Cloud Foundry environments. Although this optimization achieves higher density and performance by default in other environments, more work is required to achieve these benefits in Docker and Cloud Foundry. The presentation provides a blueprint for achieving higher density and performance in the cloud and covers\n• The unique characteristics of the Docker and Cloud Foundry environments that are a challenge\n• What needs to be done to enable the optimization\n• The experiments the speaker and his colleagues ran, and results measured\n\nSpeaker:\nMichael Dawson, Senior Software Developer, IBM\nMichael Dawson has worked with the IBM J9 JVM team for the past ten years, implementing core JVM components. He has contributed to IBM Java deliverables over the years, including WebSphere Real Time plus Java 6, Java 7 and Java 8 releases across platforms. In the last few years, he contributed to IBM cloud and virtualization efforts for Java technology. In the past, he held leadership roles in teams that developed e-commerce applications and delivered them as services, including EDI communication services, credit card processing, online auctions, and electronic invoicing."
