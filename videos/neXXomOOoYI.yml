recordingDate: 1484803453
description: "Rikki Endsley\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/174/\nWhether you're a layperson talking about free software law, or a lawyer speaking to a layperson, how you deliver your message determines how well your audience understands it. In this talk we'll look at common mistakes laypeople make when interpreting legal issues, and tips for legal experts for condensing and explaining complicated topics to the layperson. We'll also take a quick look at hot free software law and policy topics, the kinds of people writing about them (e.g., lawyers vs. programmers), and what's missing (i.e., the topics community members want to learn more about)."
