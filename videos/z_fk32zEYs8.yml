recordingDate: 1445386804
description: "Java EE 7 has been finalised mid 2013 and from J2EE to Java EE 7, much has changed ... but we are not done yet! Through the years, Java EE has always reinventing itself. Java EE 8 will be no exception to this rule!\nIn this session, we will look at the current state of Java EE 8. We will review the various new JSRs that will be part of Java EE 8 (e.g. MVC, JSON-B, Security JSR). We will obviously also look how the existing technologies will evolves in Java EE 8 (e.g. Servlet 4 which brings HTTP/2 support, JMS's plan to replace Message Driven Beans, CDI/EJB alignment, JAX-RS 2.1, etc.)."
