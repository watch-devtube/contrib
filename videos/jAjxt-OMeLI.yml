description: "Effective Development with Kubernetes: Techniques, Tools and Telepresence - Philip Lombardi, Datawire.io \n\nEvery software development cycle is rife with inefficiency. Seasoned devs know the pain of getting access to essential remote systems, waiting for tests to run (and then fail), or debugging with only log files. This talk teaches you how to best leverage Kubernetes, remote infrastructure and related tooling to create a dev cycle that maximizes velocity and minimizes developer friction and frustration.  Using tools such as Kubernetes, Docker and Telepresence, I will walk attendees through several advanced techniques that can be used to produce an effective developer experience and optimized dev loop. The goal of this is to eliminate many sources of frustrating inefficiency and reduce cycle time between releases. I will demonstrate how to incrementally adopt some of these techniques and how to approach introducing new and unfamiliar technology and techniques to skeptical dev teams. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrRL"
