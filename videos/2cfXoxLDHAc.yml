description: "Learn important features of Java EE 7 through several examples using a hands-on approach, including working code demonstrations. The examples are presented in a problem/solution/how-it-works recipe-style format, correlating usage of APIs with real-life scenarios. This presentation introduces topics via an easy-to-understand approach, and the examples showcase new features of Java EE 7 as well as mature Java EE features. The recipes cover a variety of APIs, from JSF and JPA to WebSocket, providing an overview of Java EE 7 along with examples of using APIs together. It also explains server-side resources using GlassFish 4. You will walk away with a solid understanding of some of the most important features of Java EE 7.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJosh Juneau\nJosh Juneau works as an application developer, system analyst, and database administrator.
