title: '#bbuzz 2015: Szehon Ho - Hive on Spark'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433340057
description: "Find more information here: http://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/hive-spark\n\nApache Hive is a popular SQL interface for batch processing and ETL using Apache Hadoop.  Until recently, MapReduce was the only Hadoop execution engine for Hive queries. But today, alternative execution engines are available — such as Apache Spark and Apache Tez.  The Hive and Spark communities are joining forces to introduce Spark as a new execution engine option for Hive.\n\nIn this talk we'll discuss the Hive on Spark project.  Topics include the motivations, such as improving Hive user experience and streamlining operational management for Spark shops, some background and comparisons of MapRededuce and Spark, and the technical process of porting a complex real-world application from MapReduce to Spark.  A demo will also be presented."
