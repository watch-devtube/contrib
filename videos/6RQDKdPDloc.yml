language: English
recordingDate: 1513268856
description: "When people think of product security, they think of an enforcer telling them \"no\" or \"don't do that\" or \"I'm suprised you didn't know that\". At Cloud Foundry, we're trying to improve product security while building a healthy agile security culture. In this Ignite session I'll talk about how the CF teams are working on a secure development lifecycle, some pain points we've hit along the way, and best practices for shipping security features quickly and (relatively) painlessly. Participants should come away with knowledge on how to improve the culture of product security at their organization.\n\nSlides: TBA\n\nMolly Crowther, Technical Program Manager, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
