description: 'But it makes things so nice and easy :) AMP at its heart is a JavaScript library for building super fast static web pages. Being purely web tech based, we can understand how it works and take the best ideas and use them in non-AMP projects. This talk will dig into the nitty gritty details of AMP and uncover how the sausage is made so to say. We’ll talk about network concurrency, font loading, image optimizations, and this magic thing called pre-rendering. Even if you never plan to use AMP, you’ll learn new tricks that you’ll be able to use to speed up your next project!'
