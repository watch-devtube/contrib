title: '#FOSSBack: Dirk Riehle - First Ph.D. Then Startup'
recordingDate: 1614686602
description: "As a professor, I want to create open source startups with my doctoral (Ph.D.) students. To that end, I have set up courses and a whole program. Frankly, there is no better place than Germany to get started, as public funding can carry you through the research well into Series A territory. In this talk, I'll explain how I try to give my students their Ph.D. and help them turn their research work into a startup.\n\n\n###########\n\nFollow us on Social Media and join the Community!\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fossbckstg\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8653059/​\n\nFOSS Backstage is an event by Plain Schwarz – https://plainschwarz.com"
