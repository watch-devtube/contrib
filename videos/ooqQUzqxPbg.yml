description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nThis is a frank discussion about the benefits and challenges of scaling Erlang for massive communications applications in distributed environments. The talk will focus on how 2600hz uses Erlang, some of the Best practices we've learned while building our stack and how Erlang has really helped us get to market faster and easier.\n\nKazoo leverages Erlang as a core component of the infrastructure and so we have developed some unique insight into how Erlang can be run at scale. In particular, we focus on maintaining complex systems in multiple geographic areas using some of the unique properties that Erlang allows."
