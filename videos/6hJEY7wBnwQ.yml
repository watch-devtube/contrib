title: 'Tech Mesh 2012 - Up up and Out: Scaling Software with Akka - Jonas Bonér'
language: English
recordingDate: 1379429020
description: "We believe that one should never have to choose between productivity and scalability, which has been the case with the traditional approaches to concurrency and distribution. The cause of that has been the wrong tools and the wrong layer of abstraction and Akka is here to change that. Akka is a unified runtime and programming model for scaling both UP (utilizing multi-core processors) and OUT (utilizing the grid/cloud). With Akka 2 this will be taken to a whole new level with its \"Distributed by Design\"?. Akka 2 provides location transparency by abstracting away both these tangents of scalability by turning them into operations and configuration task. This gives Akka runtime the freedom to do adaptive automatic load-balancing, cluster rebalancing, replication and partitioning. Akka is available at http://akka.io (under Apache 2 license).\n\n\n\n\nLiked the song? It's \"Tank\" by Seatbelts"
