title: 'YOW! 2012 Walter Bright - Component Programming in D'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513433618
description: "Architecting a complex program out of simpler, independent building blocks has long been recognized as a means to higher programmer productivity and programs that work better. But creating independent, robust, high performance, reusable software components turns out to be remarkably difficult. Most schemes fall well short. I will show how a combination of features of the D programming language enables the creation of best-of-breed components that 'snap together' with ease, with plenty of headroom for user customization and compiler optimization.\n\nWalter Bright graduated from Caltech in 1979 with a degree in mechanical engineering. He worked for Boeing for 3 years on the development of the 757 stabilizer trim system. He then switched to writing software, in particular compilers, and has been writing them ever since. Walter has written, from front to back, compilers for C, C++, Javascript, Java, and the D programming language. He is the principal architect for the D programming language. Software Passion: I constantly look for ways to make programming languages better and compilers more powerful.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
