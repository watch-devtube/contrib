The program is designed for people who yearn for more balance in day-to-day life, and it promotes healthy living, renewal and stress management.\r\n \r\nMindfulness is the practice of cultivating non-judgmental awareness in day-to-day life. Mindfulness develops the potential to experience each moment, no matter how difficult or intense, with serenity and clarity. One can feel more alive and gain access to the powerful inner resources for healing. Participants learn lifelong tools to help maximize life, even in the midst of stress, pain and illness.\r\n\r\n\r\nBob Stahl, PhD., founded and directs mindfulness-based stress reduction programs in five medical centers in the San Francisco Bay area including El Camino Hospital in Mt.
