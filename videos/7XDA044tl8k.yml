description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nModelling Microservices at Spotify\n\nOne of the challenges with a microservices architecture is understanding it. How do you figure out what connects to what, where things are deployed, what capabilities the total system of services has? This is a talk about System-Z, the microservice-based microservices modelling system we use at Spotify to understand our set of services. We use a combination of runtime collection of data and mostly-static service metadata. The system currently tracks about 1000 components deployed to about 8000 machines, and we're looking at extending it to also tracking our data collection and analysis pipelines, as well as possible client-side features.\n\nPetter Måhlén, Spotify\n\nCurrently building infrastructure and developer tools at Spotify, Petter has 20 years of experience of software development in many roles: developer, project manager, product owner, CTO, architect, etc. The last few years, he has eschewed management roles for love of coding, and has worked mostly on building large-scale distributed systems for the web."
