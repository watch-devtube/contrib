description: "I ask 67 questions to Dr Alan Baratz, the Chief Product Officer of D-Wave Systems. D-Wave has built an incredible quantum computer, and invited me to Vancouver to attend a special launch event of their new Leap system, which allows any developer to use quantum computing very easily in the cloud. In this interview, Alan walks me through the D-Wave facility in Vancouver, and we even get to step inside the quantum computer room.
