description: "JSF 2.2 is a component specification of Java EE 7, the theme of which is bringing Java EE to the cloud. This presentation shows you how to build multitenant-ready applications, using two new features in JSF 2.2: Faces Flows and multitemplating. These features make it possible to build JSF applications that offer view-level customizability to be performed by the application vendor or the application deployer. The presentation uses a sample application to illustrate these concepts.\n\n\nAuthor:\nEdward Burns\nEd Burns is a Senior Staff Engineer for Oracle Corporation where he chairs the JSR 344 (JSF 2.2) Expert Group and contributes to the open source Mojarra project.
