description: "Progressive web apps aka PWAs are experiences which bundles the best of web and the best of apps. With new APIs like service worker, Push Notifications, background sync, Homescreen icons, PWAs can deliver a matching experience to most native apps. They load quickly, even on flaky networks, can re-engage with users by sending web push notifications and load as top-level, full screen experiences. Learn about these APIs and what it takes to build some of the core pieces of a PWA experience and deliver a super engaging experience with PWAs.\n\nPrateek Bhatnagar\nI am a UX Engineer at Google India.
