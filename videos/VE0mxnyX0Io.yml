description: "During this session, we will cover how Accenture works with our clients to drive agile transformation at all levels of the enterprise. We will explore key activities and the lessons we have learned as we review a client's 18 month journey from waterfall, to scrum, to XP. We will talk about getting started with pair programming, starting with unit tests and moving through automated functional test in a monolith, and how development teams are taking back control from specialized operations teams. \n\nExecs, architects, and engineers who really focus on the business will learn common issues that agile teams experience as they transform from waterfall to agile and several common patterns to address these issues by attending this talk.\n\nSeptember 25, 2018\n12:10 pm - 12:40 pm\nNational Harbor 12-13\n\nSpeakers\nRyan Johnson\nAssociate Director, Accenture\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
