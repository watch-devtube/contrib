title: 'YOW! 2019 - Juliet Hougland - How to Experiment Quickly'
recordingDate: 1582228811
description: "The ‘science’ in data science refers to the underlying philosophy that you don’t know what works for your business until you make changes and rigorously measure impact. Rapid experimentation is a fundamental characteristic of high functioning data science teams. They experiment with models, business processes, user interfaces, marketing strategies, and anything else they can get their hands on. In this talk I will discuss what data platform tooling and organisational designs support rapid experimentation in data science teams.\n\nData scientist and engineer with expertise in computational mathematics and years of hands-on machine learning and big data experience. Regular worldwide keynote and invited speaker. For many years Juliet has been a contributor to the open source community working on projects such as Apache Spark, Scalding, and Kiji.\n\nFor more on YOW!
