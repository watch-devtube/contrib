language: English
recordingDate: 1622561214
description: 'Using Ansible to install, setup, and configure a Google Kubernetes Cluster (GKE) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is paramount to maintain consistency across different environments. IaC resolves the environment drift issue where each environment has unique configurations that are not reproducible automatically. Ansible is the tool of choice to implement this tutorial. It helps us to create the necessary code to provision a basic Kubernetes cluster on GCP (GKE) automation.'
