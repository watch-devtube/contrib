When you confront him with a complex problem, he's able to explain the solution with amazing lucidity, giving you the feeling that the problem had always been really simple and transparent. That's what you want: someone that takes the huge load of experience and brings it to you in a comprehensible way.\n\n# Jeroen Horemans\nJeroen is a Java/RockStar with a fabulous t-shirt-taste. The IT scene is like a forest filled with mushrooms and most of them are poisonous, but not Jeroen. He's the Java Champion you want in your team, the craftsman you can rely on and the skilled Ninja you want your project to be rescued by,… and on a bad hair day he puts the sexy in dyslexia."
