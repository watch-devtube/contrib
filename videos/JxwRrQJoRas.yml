description: "Most well known mobile architectures start to work against you after your engineering team grows large. A new architecture paradigm is needed to better support the development of mobile applications with hundreds of mobile engineers.\n\nAfter investigating all other mobile architectures, Uber created RIB's, a cross-platform architecture designed with reliability, testability, isolation, maintainability and developer velocity in mind. In this talk, you'll learn about the motivation to create an entirely new mobile architecture, the process that let us re-write the Uber application in 3 months with 200 engineers and an overview of the architecture itself. We will also share lessons learned throughout this process."
