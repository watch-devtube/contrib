description: 'Lars takes DevOps one step beyond forming a happy collaborative relation between Dev and Ops. He advocates for an entirely elastic and automated infrastructure. If software is eating the world - shouldn''t the software developer then be in the drivers seat?It''s a glimpse into a not so far out future where quality is actually built into the software, as opposed to glued on after it''s finished. It''s a future where software developers aren''t dependent on IT Operations at all.In a Continuous Delivery NoOps world queues have disappeared, resources are available at your command and everything is automated.'
