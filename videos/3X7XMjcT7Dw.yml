description: "WebSocket is cool, and you probably already played with it. But it’s just a transport technology. If you have thousands of client connections you need to do lots of improvements to make it scalable, reliable and achieve high performance. You need to implement many things on top of it.\n\nWe are building financial data streaming platform for thousands of traders using WebSocket. I’m going to share my experience and cover such techniques as delta delivery, conflation, dynamic throttling, bandwidth and frequency limitation and other. I will also do a live demo of how to build scalable WebSocket backend from scratch using Java and Spring."
