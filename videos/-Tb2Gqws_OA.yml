description: "Filmed at https://2018.dotai.io on May 31st in Paris. More talks on https://www.dotconferences.com/talks\n\nDeep Learning has been delivering state of the art results across a growing number of problems and domains. Correspondingly, Deep Learning models are being deployed across a growing number of applications and use cases. Hagay shows us what deploying deep neural networks to production mean, design considerations and challenges for model serving, and how the open source project Model Serving for Apache MXNet is designed to address these challenges."
