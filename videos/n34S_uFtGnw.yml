description: "RejectJS 2013 - http://rejectjs.org - Berlin, September 12, 2013\nSlides: http://timruffles.github.io/reject-js-2013-talk/#/\n\n\nTalk description: \"Node.js is a great tool for input-output heavy problems, but complex workflows create a new challenge: callback pyramids of doom. Thankfully a posse of tools is being gathered to flatten these pyramids. We'll look at a range of these techniques, from the old favourites like observers to exotic languages that compile to Javascript.\n\nHandling heaps of IO isn't fun if the code gets ugly - see how you can make node look as beautiful as it performs!\"\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
