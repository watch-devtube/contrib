title: 'New Concurrency Models on the JVM: Fibres, Verticles, Agents and Actors. by Lutz Huehnken'

description: 'Until recently, concurrency in Java meant: java.util.concurrent and threads. Threads were originally envisioned as "lightweight processes" - starting a new process for concurrent operations meant to much overhead, and posed the problem of inter-process communication. Threads were supposed to be light and remove both disadvantages - less resource consumption for creation and scheduling, and shared memory. Today it seems this model has reached it''s limits. The context switch between threads is not a good match for modern processor architectures, resource needs are still to high for fine-grained concurrency, and shared mutual state is a curse, not a blessing, leading to race conditions, locks, contention. To quote Oracle JVM architect John Rose: "Threads are passé". We will explore different approaches to concurrency below the thread level, and have a look at their advantages and disadvantages. Namely we will look at Quasar Fibres, Clojure Agents, vert.x Verticles and Akka Actors.'
