description: 'You live in an exponential era. It’s time to look with “new eyes” to the world around you and the empowerment you have to change and innovate our economy & society by rethinking and reprogramming legacy processes using the new building blocks the Internet-of-Everything will offer. The Internet must be made ready to handle trillions of new interactions between people, processes, data and things, whilst being intelligent, secure, open and programmable. You have the opportunity (or obligation?) to be involved. The world around screams for an update and needs developers to lead.'
