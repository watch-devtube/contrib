description: "Burning Down The House: How to Plan for and Deal with Disaster Recovery in CF - Jatin Naik & Therese Stowell, Pivotal    \n\nPeople make mistakes. Hardware fails. Hurricanes, volcanoes, acts of God. You’ve installed Cloud Foundry and are running 1000 mission-critical apps. You’re the operator and the health of CF is on your head, how do you sleep at night? \nBackups? But.. is backup an outdated term in a cloud native world? What does it mean to back up Cloud Foundry? What components are involved? What about data services? \nIn this talk Therese and Jatin will dig into CF internals to map out what’s required to make reliable backups of Cloud Foundry and app data. They will talk through the challenges of engineering a robust b+r solution that works across IaaSs. They will look at different tools and approaches in use now, and discuss issues like downtime and consistency across multiple components. Finally they will present their proposed BOSH-based framework for backup and recovery plus other potential solutions, from disk imaging to event streams, while considering potential modifications to CF to make it more backup-able.\n\nJatin Naik\nJatin Naik is an Engineer on the Cloud Foundry team at Pivotal, working on backup and restore. He is interested in BOSH and Cloud Foundry, and spoke at CF Summit Europe last year on an intro to writing an app for CF and a multi-cloud CPI.\n\nTherese Stowell\nPivotal\nStaff Product Manager\nLondon\nWebsitepivotal.io\nTherese Stowell is Product Manager at Pivotal.
