title: 'Test-driving modern web apps. At scale. by Jan Molak'

description: "Even though the JavaScript frameworks such as Angular or React have changed and improved dramatically over the last couple of years, the way we design the acceptance tests for our JavaScript applications and the design patterns we use to do that is still stuck in 2009. This makes it difficult to write acceptance tests using Protractor/WebDriver at scale, especially on those projects where multiple teams are involved.\n\nIn this talk, I will demonstrate Serenity/JS, a TypeScript implementation of the popular Serenity BDD library, that addresses those problems and lets you test modern web apps using the Screenplay Pattern and benefit from the powerful reporting features provided by Serenity BDD.\n\nCombining the advantages of Protractor, the expressive Screenplay DSL, tooling support for TypeScript, and the powerful reporting features of Serenity BDD, Serenity/JS is set to become the tool of choice for your web automated testing!\n\nJan Molak\nSoftware development consultant and coach, author of Serenity/JS, Jenkins Build Monitor and many other open-source projects. Helps organisations around the world deliver valuable software."
