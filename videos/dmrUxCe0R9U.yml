title: '[JSConfUS 2013] Scott Andrews: Taming Client-Server Communication'
recordingDate: 1381852494
description: 'In the early days of the web, a browser could only interact with a server on page load. The XMLHttpRequest enabled the web 2.0 revolution popularizing RESTful web services in the process. Now, with HTML5, we have WebSockets. WebSockets enable a plethora of messaging based communication patterns. This talk will dive into two cujoJS libraries that specialize in client-server communication: rest.js (https://github.com/cujojs/rest) for consuming RESTful HTTP services and msgs.js (https://github.com/cujojs/msgs) for message oriented programing between clients and servers utilizing WebSockets. We''ll talk about what access patterns each of these mediums enable and how to extend these libraries to fit your specific needs.'
