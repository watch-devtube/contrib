description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nBen Rockwood - Software Engineer at Netflix\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this talk, I will describe the challenges of ensuring the fast flow of development features of the Joyent cloud infrastructure, while preserving stability, reliability and security.  I will describe the operational and business operational, architectural and deployment challenges, as well as the techniques we've developed to plan and execute.  I'll describe how we interact with the engineering organization, the processes we rely upon internally, how we prioritize our work, how we create weekly production schedules, the tools we rely upon, and the outcomes we've been able to generate (e.g., increased stability, deployability, faster flow of deploys, better releases, and more satisfied customers).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
