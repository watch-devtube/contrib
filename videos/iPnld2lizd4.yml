recordingDate: 1510303650
description: "People ask me every day \"How should I manage my containers in production?\" It's a common question because there are so many good options available: Kubernetes, DC/OS, Rancher, Docker EE.\n\nIn the end the decision on what technology you use should be driven by what your specific challenges you face: on both the technological as well as the business front.\n\nIn this vendor agnostic session we'll discuss the key considerations you should look at when choosing a container orchestration platform as well as some of the questions you should be able to answer before choosing a solution.\n\n# Patrick van der Bleek\nPatrick is a Solutions Engineer at Docker, helping customers adopt container technology across the entire Software Supply Chain enabling them to become more agile while maintaining a cost effective, portable and controlled IT infrastructure. Prior to joining Docker, he held a variety of Linux related roles at Red Hat and the Dutch Police."
