description: "Speaker: Ankita Gupta, Full-Stack Software Engineer, Honestbee\n\nWe often hear about Test Driven Development (TDD), and RSpec is a great aid in doing so. However what could be one of the biggest disadvantages of writing tests? The answer is slow tests. Yes, its true that if there were no tests then there would not be a slow test suite. But that's not the point. Tests are a developer's friend, and in this talk I will talk more about how to use FactoryGirl appropriately to speed up your RSpecs.\n\nSpeaker's Bio\nAnkita is working as a full-stack software engineer at honestbee. In her free time, she works on her non-profit project Jugnuu, a low-cost, mobile-based English language solution for children.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.reddotrubyconf.com/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/ONqX/"
