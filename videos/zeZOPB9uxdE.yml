title: 'Practical Functional Programming in JavaScript - Ben Katz'
recordingDate: 1521982423
description: "Everyone is talking about Functional Programming nowadays: various functional languages translate to JavaScript (e.g., Elm, ClojureScript, and PureScript) and Redux is a very popular architecture. Ben's talk is an attempt to go back to the basics; to the core concepts of Functional Programming. Most of the talk is about simple concepts that exist today without the need for libraries or frameworks. Ben wants to try and lead the audience to understand the value and what it means to write functional code, today. After watching this, you will finally learn what’s better about FP!\nHe promises, there are no monads here.\n\nBen has been in the software industry for over 10 years. Today, he is tech-leading a front-end project at Wix, and in the last few years has been talking about concepts of software and programming.\nEver growing, learning, and always looking for opportunities to pass his knowledge."
