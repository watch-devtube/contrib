description: "A Google TechTalk, 12/6/16, presented by Alexey Nezhdanov\nABSTRACT: Esperanto is a constructed language that is 100+ years old.  I shared my own experience learning this language.\n\nSome comments for the video:\n\n0:17 An agitation that the talk has finally started affected my English which is bad enough even without that :( Sorry.\n\n1:45 Complete miss. I meant the country - and a different one - and I would still have been wrong. Zamenhof was born in Białystok which at the time belonged to the Russian Empire (now Poland).\n\n14:18 \"Poste\" is a proverb, not a pronoun.\n\n19:45 Zurich German kicks in (I'm in the second week of the language course). The correct possessive pronoun would be \"mia\", not \"mis\"\n\n21:49 \"They\" is just a single person that I asked. A Spanish-speaking person said (today) that it looks like Czech language to him.\n\n26:35 The question being asked is \"what actual scientific principles were used in creation of Esperanto?\"\n\n37:45 The question being asked is \"what is an estimate of a chance of meeting another esperantist?\"\n\n38:18 The \"99.X%\" figure that I use is actually my interpretation of the phrase \"almost all\" plus some other facts\n\n40:30 I misunderstood the question. The question was \"is it mostly no problem to split a stream of sounds into individual words\" and my answer was to the question \"is it easy enough to segment written words into sub-parts\". The answer to original question would be \"I would expect so, but I don't know\"."
