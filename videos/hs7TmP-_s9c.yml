language: English
recordingDate: 1499346116
description: "In this talk, we\\'ll talk about the key ideas of NOSQL databases, including motivating similarities and more importantly their different strengths and weaknesses. In more depth, we'll focus on the characteristics of graph stores for connected data and the kinds of problems for which they are best suited. To reinforce how useful graph stores are, we provide a rapid, code-focussed example using Neo4j covering the basics of graph stores, and the APIs for manipulating and traversing graphs. We'll then use this knowledge to explore the Doctor Who universe, using graph databases to infer useful knowledge from connected, semi-structured data. We conclude with a discussion of when different kinds of NOSQL stores are most appropriate the enterprise.\n\nDr. Jim Webber is Chief Scientist with Neo Technology the company behind the popular open source graph database Neo4j, where he works on graph database server technology and writes open source software. Jim is interested in using big graphs like the Web for building distributed systems, which led him to being a co-author on the book \"REST in Practice\", having previously written \"Developing Enterprise Web Services - An Architect's Guide.\" Jim is an active speaker, presenting regularly around the world.\n\nFor more on YOW!
