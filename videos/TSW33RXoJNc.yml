description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Gary Russell\nData / Integration Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-one2gx-2014integration-41083190\nThere have been 2 major releases of Spring Integration since the last SpringOne 2GX. The 3.0 release added a number of important new components and provided extensive improvements to SpEL support enabling much richer SpEL processing. The 4.0 release added more components and extensive support for annotation-based config, reducing or even eliminating the need for XML configuration. It also laid the groundwork for the Java DSL extension.\n\nIn this session we will examine many of these new features in detail. It will be mostly hands-on demonstration and code walk throughs."
