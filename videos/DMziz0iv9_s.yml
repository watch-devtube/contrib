This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines multiple criteria to obtain single \ncriteria.\n\nVideo gives a brief insight of following topics:\n\n1.What is Filtering Design pattern ?\n\n2.Use cases of Filtering Design patterns\n\n3. Sample Random Sampling example\n\n4.Bloom Filtering Pattern\n\n5.Demo on filtering patterns\n\n\nRelated Blog : \nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/tailored-big-data-solutions-using-mapreduce-design-patterns?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=webinar&utm_campaign=mapreduce-filt-data\n\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would\nprefer a hassle free and self paced learning environment, accessible from any part of the world.\n\nThe topics related to MapReduce Design Patterns for Filtering  have extensively been covered in our course 'MapReduce Design Patterns’.\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India: +91-8880862004"
