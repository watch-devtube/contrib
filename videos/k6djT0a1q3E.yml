description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nAs the era of frequency scaling comes to an end, multi-core parallelism has become an essential focal point in computational research. Mainstream languages, however, have not yet adapted to take full advantage of parallelism provided by the hardware. While new languages such as Rust and Swift are catching on and implementing multi-core algorithms in their libraries, C++ has only started to do so. A parallel Standard Library could bring with it many positive features that users can begin taking advantage of.\n\nThis talk will focus around two standards proposals, N4409 and N4406. N4409 outlines the details of a parallel Standard Library and features of these new parallel algorithms. The complementary N4406 outlines abstractions to take advantage of various mechanisms for parallel execution. We will cover the reasons why the new Standard Library would be beneficial to C++ users and our experience implementing these algorithms in HPX. The presentation will address what exactly the two proposals define, the challenges we faced, and the results we collected. In addition, we will discuss extensions made to these proposals and the C++11/14 standard in HPX to support these semantics in a distributed environment.\n— \nDaniel Bourgeois:  I'm a student at LSU and have been working at the SET||AR research group helping implement parallel algorithms inside of HPX. Feel free to talk to me about new C++ features, parallel computing or anything else.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
