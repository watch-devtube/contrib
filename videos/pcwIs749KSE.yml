description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nKotlin multiplatform support is a powerful feature that allows us to share code between multiple projects across platforms where it wasn't previously simple or even possible. In this talk we explore how to take advantage of this feature by dissecting a project that uses concepts like expect/actual keywords, expectedBy, typealiases, javascript interop and more. By the end, attendees will have a solid understanding of how to get started and build their own Kotlin projects leveraging multiplatform support and code sharing.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nFelipe Lima is a Brazilian engineer with over 10 years of experience who is passionate about clean and maintainable code, functional programming and, obviously, Kotlin. Currently works at Airbnb on developer infrastructure."
