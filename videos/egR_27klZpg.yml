description: "This talk will provide a unique insight into the core design processes applied by the Creator design team at LEGO. John-Henry will cover all steps along the way, from concept generation to product verification, testing and sign-off. He will show you how real design thinking can influence not only product features, but also how your ideas could be perceived on a global scale. There is more to being a LEGO designer than meets the eye, and this presentation could change the way you think about challenges you might face in your daily work as well. It will appeal to anyone who has an interest in creative design, logical building, or just wants to be an 8 year old for half an hour!\n\nJohn-Henry is a British creative designer who has been living and working in Denmark for the past four years. His thought-provoking environmental and social design philosophies, displayed at the 2008 New Designers exhibition in London, won him a dream job innovating toys at LEGO, where his passion now lies in spreading the essence of Play worldwide. With his vast knowledge of the building system John-Henry hopes to transfer LEGO principles and logic into other fields of study and business entrepreneurship. At a recent TED event in New York, John-Henry's motto \"Play Hard, Work Better!\" challenged corporate responsibility and social attitudes towards play at work, and he now hopes to broaden the way businesses think about innovation culture globally.\n\nFor more on YOW!
