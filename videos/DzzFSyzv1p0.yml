description: "How did OpenAI's team of 5 neural networks manage to beat some of the world's best DOTA 2 players? Also, why would OpenAI dedicate so much time and energy to defeating video game players? In this video, I'll explain in detail the cutting edge research techniques OpenAI used to create such an incredible AI algorithm, and how it could be used in the real world. These techniques include Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks, Proximal Policy Optimization, and a custom rollout system they've dubbed 'Rapid'. \n\nCode for this video: \nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/OpenAI_Five_vs_Dota2_Explained\n\nPlease Subscribe!
