description: "Mohamed Taman, Sr. Enterprise Architect / Sr. Software Engineer, WebCentric\n\nDevelopers creating websites, especially back-end developers, need to know how to build RESTful APIs correctly. Nowadays those APIs are serving many channels: mobile, microservices components, IoT, integration, or all of these. This session will help you plan and model your own APIs and understand security and the six REST design constraints that help guide your architecture. It starts with a simple overview, including advice on identifying the participants in your system and the activities they might perform with it. The presenter will help you paper-test your model, validating the design before you build it and providing a live example to make sure the concept is clear. Finally the session explores the HTTP concepts and REST constraints needed to build your API."
