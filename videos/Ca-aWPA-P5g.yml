recordingDate: 1441815986
description: "The way we experience food is highly complex. In this interactive keynote, Wrigley creativity fellow and chemist Gwendolyn Graff will describe the different biological and neural pathways by which our brain gets information, interprets it, and puts together inputs to draw meaning and understanding of what we are eating. The audience will sample individual tastants, scents, and trigeminals to experience the components of food separately, then combine them to see how we can tease our brains.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreilly\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
