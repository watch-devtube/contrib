title: 'Respect Software Testing - Linda Hoff'
recordingDate: 1513870291
description: "I think I've seen it all; From organizations where testing is treated like scrap and not even let in to the same building as the rest of the company, or where testing is non-existing, to companies where teams have 50/50 programmers and testers and test activities always get the time they deserve. If a deadline cannot be reached, the feature will be scoped out instead of squeezing the test slot into barely any time at all. I myself have also been at the bottom, with zero recognition and been totally misunderstood. Luckily, I have also been at the top, respected by everyone (at least as far as I can tell...) and trusted. I prefer to be at the top and my plan is to stay there. Today, I know more about what it takes.\n\nThis talk will cover how to become a respected and recognized tester. This will not only be beneficial to you as an individual test professional, but also to the whole test business. Let’s make “Software Tester” a highly respected and sought-after profession.\n\n\n\nLinda Hoff has a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Blekinge Institute of Technology (2001) and has since then worked with software test. Linda has a wide experience of software test from different project models and different industries. Her biggest interest is how you can pick the cherries from several techniques, to get an optimal mix. Lately Linda been focusing a lot on how to provide good and valuable information, which she thinks is key to our success as testers. Linda is also an experienced speaker with a quite long list of talks done on different conferences where one of the latest ones is EuroSTAR 2017 in Copenhagen.\n\nI think I've seen it all; From organizations where testing is treated like scrap and not even let in to the same building as the rest of the company, or where testing is non-existing, to companies where teams have 50/50 programmers and testers and test activities always get the time they deserve.
