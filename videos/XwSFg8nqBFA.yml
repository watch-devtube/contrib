description: "Ask and vote for questions at https://developers.google.com/live/shows/913996610\n\nMEAN is a full app development stack including MongoDB, Express, Node.JS and AngularJS. In this hour we'll visit with Valeri Karpov of MongoDB who first coined the term. He'll cover background on why he selected these components and why other developers might choose the same stack. From there, we'll chat with Ward Bell from IdeaBlade discussing how BreezeJS makes managing data simpler in large applications. Our last speakers are from StrongLoop. They'll present on how MEAN can work for mobile enterprise environments. We'll end with a short Q&A."
