description: "Speaker: Dr Jacob Greenshpan\n\nAbout Dr Jacob Greenshpan \n\nUX strategic design, lecturing around the world and innovation — these are what I do. I design creative user interface and am honoured to be a member of the advisory board for the Google Launchpad accelerator for startups.\n\nI have a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology and user interface design. Building innovative, top-of-the-line UX solutions and applications has been my passion for the last 20+ years. Before becoming an independent consultant, I co-founded two companies: UI Ltd. (which is the largest company in Israel for UX design) and Applied Cognitive Engineering, Ltd. (ACE) for cognitive training. \n\nIn addition to working as strategic UX consultant, I coordinate the UX activity for Google’s Launchpad program, an acceleration program for startups. I have created UX expert communities for helping startups in Berlin, Paris, Barcelona, Bangalore, Rio de Janeiro, Jakarta, Mexico City and many more places. I have had the honour of meeting over 700 startups around the world and helping them turn their dreams into reality. \n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/IxDA-Singapore/events/240582296/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/7mss/"
