description: "Achieving Inclusivity Through Remote Work by Jameson Hampton\n\n\"A strength of the tech industry is its ability to facilitate remote work. Remote work helps people — particularly people who are part of marginalized communities, such as folks who are undergoing a gender transition. We often talk about how to foster inclusive teams and remote work can be a big factor in that!\n\nIn this talk, you’ll learn about barriers that disproportionately affect underrepresented folks in tech, like health concerns, financial/geographical logistics and emotional burnout, as well as the ways working remotely can ease those burdens, and how to promote healthy distributed teams.\"\n\n__________\n\nJamey is a non-binary adventurer from Buffalo, NY who wishes they were immortal so they’d have time to visit every coffee shop in the world. They’re a Rails engineer who recently took the plunge into DevRel, and they're a panelist on the podcast Greater than Code. In their free time, they do advocacy in the transgender community, write comics and travel as much as they can (which isn't very much right now)! They tweet at @jameybash."
