title: 'JDK 9, 10 and 11: Pitfalls For The Unwary by Simon Ritter'
recordingDate: 1549414258
description: "Three releases of Java in one year! A big change to how Java is delivered, but its not the only one. JDK 9 introduced a significant change in the form of the module system that can impact how easy it is to run existing applications. JDK 9 also started a long overdue cleanup of the JDK, removing features as well as adding them. This has continued in JDK 10 and JDK 11.\n\nIn this session, well look at all the areas of JDK 9, 10 and 11 that may impact application migration. This will cover all aspects: Java language syntax, class libraries and JVM options (a significant number of which have changed in these releases).\n\nWell also look at how the new JDK release cadence will impact Java support and the choices of which Java versions to use in production."
