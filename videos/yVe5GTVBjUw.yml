title: '[DevFest Nantes 2018] What Can We Learn With JavaScript Fatigue'
language: French
recordingDate: 1540898148
description: "Speaker : Lucas Fernandes Da Costa\n\nBy the time I’m writing this abstract NPM has 568,191packages. Tomorrow an average of 447 new ones will be published. In this talk, I will not complain about it. Instead, we will study this phenomenon in depth and see what can we learn from JS Fatigue and how to deal with it without headaches.\n\nThe whole reason for JS Fatigue is not the huge amount of modules we’ve got available, the real issue is the mindset we have when writing code. With an average of 447 new packages a day and lots of new technologies appearing it seems impossible to keep up with the insane velocity things happen in the JavaScript ecosystem, but actually you don’t necessarily need to.\n\nIn this talk, I won’t talk about the language itself and I won’t talk about frameworks. I will talk about what how this ended up happening and why we should see it as a positive thing from a software engineering point of view. For a very long time we have been talking about componentization and reusability and now that we’ve got it we started complaining about it, how did that happen?\n\nWe will talk about Unix Philosophy, about the current state of open source software development and about our role as software engineers, after all, we’re not paid to write code, we are paid to solve problems."
