description: 'After sitting down with Marakana for an episode of Breaking Open, Hans Dockter, creator of the open source Gradle platform, and founder of Gradleware, headed over to the SFJava Usergroup to deliver this mammoth of a speech. Chock full of code and demos, Hans goes over everything that makes Gradle awesome: from serious build automation and organization, to Maven and Ant compatibility. If you''re dealing with a jumbled mess of plugins and undocumented code, you probably want to check this presentation out.'
