language: English
recordingDate: 1540484242
description: "Adam Bien, Consultant / Contractor, Adam Bien\n\nMost enterprise applications are structured in a bureaucratic way: it is easy to find an exception or DTO, but it is impossible to tell what the application is doing. Repetition, micromanagement, and resulting bloat are the rule. This presentation creates and structures a lean and reasonable Java EE/Jakarta EE application from scratch, focuses on responsibilities, and removes any unnecessary noise—without any slides, in continuous coding/continuous explanation style."
