title: 'Zotonic: Erlang for the Web - David de Boer - EUC17'
language: English
recordingDate: 1501246203
description: "So you know and love Erlang, but what if you want to build content applications for the web? Use some big Java-based CMS? Or stick with Erlang and do everything yourself? No; use Zotonic instead!\n\nZotonic is the open source Erlang web framework and CMS. We’ll look into some of its core features: how controllerless routing, powerful templates and tight JavaScript integration enable small teams to rapidly build modern websites. Zotonic’s flexible, graph-like datamodel frees your users’ content. Out-of-the-box HTTPS makes the web more secure. Because of its extensible architecture, the framework is perfectly suited for large and complex projects, too.\n\nAs Zotonic will soon turn 1.0, I’ll share with you some lessons we learned while improving performance (binaries and Cowboy), enhancing the developer experience (Docker and documentation) and updating Zotonic for the present-day Erlang community (Hex and packages)."
