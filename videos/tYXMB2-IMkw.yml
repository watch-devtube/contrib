description: "Matteo Anelli\nDelivery Manager - NTT DATA\nA rockstar-level developer with awesome management skills. As a delivery manager I manage a team of dozens of people and follow several streams inside NTT DATA: innovate technologies, agile processes, EU funded projects and anything dealing with complex problems that need simple solutions. I'm also a podcaster (ArsLudicast) and I often help tech-heavy start-ups or indie projects."
