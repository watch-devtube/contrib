With this experience a coach is well equipped in delivering a end-to-end coaching experience where both the business as well as the development are engaged.\n\nThe Good Product Owner - A path to become great\nA good product owner is probably the most important role in any Scrum project but for some reason they are exceedingly rare. Without one the development team is without direction and lost in a vast ocean of possibilities. Why is it that being a good product owner is difficult? What is expected and how do you become a good product owner. \n\nIn this session we will cover a number of common product owner anti-patterns to learn from. In addition we will describe some good practices and provide you with some tools to be more effective and help you become the good product owner that you always dreamed about."
