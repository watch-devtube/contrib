description: "Rotisserie is an open source node.js application which runs on Kubernetes and brings the concept of the red zone in American football and applies it to the popular online battle royale game PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS (with a port to Fortnite in the works). The idea is to always be viewing the most popular PUBG twitch stream with the least amount of people alive in-game, as this is the point where streamers are tense and playing at their highest levels to achieve victory.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode Summit 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nCullen Taylor, Developer Advocate, IBM\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNode Summit Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video."
