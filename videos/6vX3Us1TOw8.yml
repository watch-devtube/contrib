title: 'Text Analytics for Health'

recordingDate: 1606240803
description: "Text Analytics for health is a preview feature of Text Analytics which enables developers to process and extract insights from unstructured clinical and biomedical text.  Through a single API call, using NLP techniques such as named entity recognition, entity linking, relation extraction and entity negation, Text Analytics can extract critical and relevant medical information without the need for time-intensive, manual development of custom models.  We will demonstrate how to make API calls to the synchronous operation offered in a downloadable container and also to the asynchronous operation offered in the hosted web API.\n\nJump To:\n[01:49] About Text Analytics\n[04:20] Demo Text Analytics for Health\n[08:27] Demo API in Postman\n[12:51] Data Privacy\n[14:14] Find more\n \nMore Information:\nText Analytics for Health - Blog https://aka.ms/AIShow/textanalyticsBlog\nText Analytics for Health - Documentation https://aka.ms/AIShow/textanalyticsDocumentation \n\nCreate a Free account (Azure) https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree \nDeep Learning vs. Machine Learning https://aka.ms/AIShow/DLvML \nGet Started with Machine Learning https://aka.ms/AIShow/StartML \nFollow Seth https://twitter.com/sethjuarez \n\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe"
