recordingDate: 1550058156
description: "In this talk I will share insights and knowledge that I have gained from building up a Data Science department from scratch. This talk will be split into three sections:\n\n1. I?ll begin by defining what Data Science is, how it is related to Machine Learning and share some tips for introducing Data Science to your organisation.\n\n2. Next up we?ll run through some commonly used Machine Learning algorithms used by Data Scientists, along with examples for use cases where these algorithms can be applied.\n\n3. The final third of the talk will be a demonstration of how you can quickly get started with Data Science and Machine Learning using Python and the Open Source scikit-learn Library."
