description: "Watch more from the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference: http://goo.gl/lXpXnG\n\nMark VanderWiele is an IBM Distinguished Engineer working on emerging cloud technologies. He was chief architect for some of the first clouds in IBM and over the last several years he has been performing research and development on cloud technology focusing on how to build more efficient data centers and shorten development cycles. Mark has helped hundreds of customers transition to cloud and uses each experience to refine future offerings. He is currently working on the PaaS layer with IBM’s BlueMix to radically simplify cloud application development and deployment.\n\nFor more information, visit: http://oreil.ly/1Cyt9nt\nSoftware architecture is a massive multidisciplinary subject, covering many roles and responsibilities, which makes it challenging to teach because so much context is required for every subject. It's also a fast-moving discipline, where entire suites of best practices become obsolete overnight.\n\nThe O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference is a new event designed to provide the necessary professional training that software architects and aspiring software architects need to succeed. A unique event, it covers the full scope of a software architect's job, from IT to leadership and business skills. It also provides a forum for networking and hearing what other professionals have learned in real-world experiences.\n\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia"
