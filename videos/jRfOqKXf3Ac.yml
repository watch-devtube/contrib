description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nLogging plays an important role on a distributed system. If done right, it helps you when you need it the most: troubleshooting problems in production. We are migrating our current project to Pivotal Cloud Foundry using Spring Boot. We developed a small Spring Boot Starter that can be used by every Spring Boot application to do the logging according to the needs of our system. In this way, the teams can concentrate on developing the business logic of the application. Our Spring Boot starter takes care of automatically logging important logging metadata like trackingId, service name, etc. In this presentation I would like to show you how we tackle the problem of logging in distributed systems by developing a simple but powerful Spring Boot Starter."
