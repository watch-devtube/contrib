description: "Developing with Cloud Foundry 101 - Maria Ntalla & Jatin Naik, Pivotal\n\nDo you want to get started with Cloud Foundry - but think that setting it up takes too long? Do you want to know to get started with using services but don’t have a BOSH director setup?\n\nJoin us while we give you a quick intro to the fundamentals and then take you through the whole process of writing, deploying, updating apps on CF.\n\nIn this session, we will iterate on an application, demonstrating how you can get started on a Cloud Foundry without even leaving your workstation - and push to a remote Cloud Foundry when ready. You will also learn how to use services from your CF application.\n\nAbout Jatin Naik\nSoftware Engineer at Pivotal, on Cloud Foundry.\n\nAbout Maria Ntalla\nMaria works as a Software Engineer with Pivotal on CloudFoundry."
