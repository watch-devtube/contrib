Here, success may be measured in millions of saved lives and permanent quality of life improvement for civilization.\r\n \r\nThis presentation examines six medical advances and their contemporary reception, with comments from invited illuminati and ghosts of the past. The six medical advances are:\r\n \r\n1. Human Anatomy Understanding\r\n2. Curing Scurvy\r\n3. Curing Smallpox\r\n4. Curing Childbed Fever\r\n5. Germ Theory\r\n6. Curing Pellagra\r\n \r\nIndividuals who find frank and candid discussions of unpleasant health realities disturbing should consider whether to expose themselves to this graphic, no-holds-barred, historical survey.\r\n \r\nW. David Schwaderer is a veteran Silicon Valley executive and entrepreneur. He has authored six commercial software programs and ten technical books. His soon-to-be-published eleventh book is titled Innovation Survival - Concept, Courage and Change.\r\n \r\nDavid has lectured on innovation at Stanford, MITs Sloan School of Management and School of Engineering SDM Program, and the Naval Postgraduate School.
