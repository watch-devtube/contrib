language: English
recordingDate: 1477086639
description: "Every time I have to check the \"Male\" or \"Female\" boxes, it feels :poop emoji:. Today, Pinterest is the only big social platform that offers expanded gender options on signup. By building and shipping expanded gender options, I learned how to convince folks that gender options in product matter, how to get time and resourcing for social justice projects at work, and how to measure the success of a feature that only a small portion of users interact with.\n\nSpeaker: Tilde Ann Thurium, Pinterest\n\nTilde Ann Thurium is an artist, engiqueer, and activist. Currently, they are an engineer on the Partners team at Pinterest. In previous lives, they have done stints as a florist, a security guard, and a Human Resources wench.
