description: "Web programming is somewhat strange: the core languages (HTML and CSS) have no means of reuse, so we have to use server-side templates and preprocessors such as LESS/SASS to compensate. On top of that, although even very basic Web applications use quite a few different technologies (think HTML/CSS/JS/Java/JSP), there are no means of making sure they fit properly together. Maybe this link is broken, maybe that style is not defined, and so on. Being a general-purpose language, Kotlin (kotlin.jetbrains.org) has no built-in support for Web programming, but you can build a Web framework in it that incorporates everything from routing to markup and client scripting in a type-safe, reusable way. In this session, you can learn how.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAndrey Breslav\nAndrey is the lead language designer for Project Kotlin, he joined the JetBrains team in 2010.\nView more trainings by Andrey Breslav at https://www.parleys.com/author/andrey-breslav\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
