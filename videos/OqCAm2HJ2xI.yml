description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/unwinding-platform-complexity-with-concourse\n\nThe first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.” - Bill Gates\n\nManaging a developer platform is difficult. Managing many of them is fraught with complexity and opportunities for error. As Allstate has worked towards becoming a technology enabled enterprise, we have been focused on delivering a next generation developer platform with Pivotal Cloud Foundry at the core. Because we have varying security, disaster recovery and availability requirements, we manage many Pivotal Cloud Foundry environments. This session will cover our journey of optimizing the pain of patching stemcells, upgrading foundations, and upgrading tiles; turning those activities into predictable and repeatable tasks using Concourse as our automation engine. At Allstate, we have used Concourse as a tool to embrace DevOps by shortening feedback loops and reducing batch sizes. During the session we will talk about how we started with a very small and simple Concourse pipeline and evolved it into a platform automation powerhouse that delivers the entirety of our developer platform ecosystem. We will discuss challenges that we encountered through the journey as well as advanced capabilities that our platform team has been able to deliver as we have eased the burden of operational heavy lifting using Concourse.\n\nSpeakers: Matt Curry; Director of Infrastructure, Allstate. Alan Moran; Cloud Foundry Architect, Allstate."
