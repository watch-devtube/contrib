title: 'YOW! Connected 2016 Sam Ritchie - Unidirectional Data Flow For Mobile'
recordingDate: 1485157130
description: "Unidirectional Data Flow is the new hotness in UI architecture, but how do we apply this to mobile apps? The easy answer is “Use React Native”, but who would want to take the easy road? Instead, in this talk we’ll go through the key elements of the unidirectional data flow style and look at how to architect this for mobile using an example Swift iOS app.\n\nThis will include:\n\n* Defining core application state and leveraging change events to update the view layer\n* Wiring up an Action dispatcher to manage state change, including background event\n* Approaches to implement navigation flow on top of the UIKit framework\n\nAttendees will gain a clear conceptual understanding of the Unidirectional style, and the practical benefits & drawbacks they’re likely to encounter using it in a mobile app.\n\nSam has a background in .NET enterprise development, but now works mainly on mobile apps & cloud services. He’s been an Apple fanboy since the 80s, and was coding Objective-C before it was cool. He mainly develops in Swift & F# these days, and actively tries to avoid writing any JavaScript.\n\nSam runs the Perth-based software consulting company codesplice, and organises the Perth iOS developers meetup group.\n\nFor more on YOW!
