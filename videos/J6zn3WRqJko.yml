description: "Buildpacks Can Be Better - Stephen Levine & Tyler Phelan, Pivotal\n\nWouldn't it be great if buildpacks were faster, more flexible, and more transparent -- but just as easy to use? This talk will detail the next generation buildpack API and the future of the buildpack model. Pivotal and Heroku are collaborating on a new buildpack API to serve as the model for buildpack-based platforms. Exciting new features include layer caching, surgical droplet updates, stack management, dependency management, and other improvements to speed up build times and offer a better experience to app developers.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyB/buildpacks-can-be-better-stephen-levine-tyler-phelan-pivotal"
