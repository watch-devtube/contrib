language: English
recordingDate: 1409705491
description: "Node.js over the past few years has gone from an esoteric platform to a platform which powers some of the most important enterprise companies in the world. We’ll explore some of the places this transformation is taking place, how these teams are implementing Node and why this is happening. Node.js is transforming engineering organizations, but it is not necessarily taking over. We’ll see why that’s not a bad thing. Node is driving innovation and accelerating teams. It is a perfect fit for modern user experience driven, software as a service projects where responsiveness and iteration are critical.\n\nDan Shaw (@dshaw) is a co-founder of NodeSource and is dedicated to helping improve and expand the Node Community. He is a veteran of numerous Node.js startups, including Voxer, Spreecast and Storify. Dan has extensive experience building large-scale, realtime systems with Node.js and has been building production services using Node since v0.2. Dan is a frequent speaker at Node.js, JavaScript and Realtime conferences, the host of the NodeUp podcast and the organizer of events like International NodeBots Day and the NodeBots SF meetup. Prior to Node, Dan worked in large-scale government contracts for Defense, Health Care and Education."
