description: "Drupal is very powerful but how much of that power is real if people can not understand or even find it?\n\nIt has historically been very hard to make big changes in how Drupal functionality gets exposed to people. At the same time, turning Drupal outside-in is a big focus for Drupal 8 and 9. We want to get better at making Drupal work like people expect things to work.\n\nLets talk about what it means to design and build better Drupal UX:\n\nWhat to work on: how to prioritise and/or sequence efforts so we can unite forces\nHow to structure the work: processes for design & build phases\nWhat we can do now: where & how to start\nWhat still needs figuring out: what are the blockers, how to remove those."
