title: 'YOW! Data 2017 Jesse Anderson - Processing Data of Any Size with Apache Beam'
recordingDate: 1508367602
description: "Rewriting code as you scale is a terrible waste of time. You have perfectly working code, but it doesn’t scale. You really need code that works at any size, whether that’s a megabyte or a terabyte. Beam allows you to learn a single API and process data as it grows. You don’t have to rewrite at every step.\n\nIn this session, we will talk about Beam and its API. We’ll see how to Beam execute on Big Data or small data. We’ll touch on some of the advanced features that make Beam an interesting choice.\n\nJesse Anderson trains at companies ranging from startups to Fortune 100 companies on Big Data. This includes training on cutting edge technology like Apache Kafka, Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. He has taught thousands of students the skills to become Data Engineers.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Data Conference, visit\nhttp://data.yowconference.com.au\n\nHe is widely regarded as an expert in the field and his novel teaching practices. Jesse is published on O’Reilly and Pragmatic Programmers. He has been covered in prestigious publications such as The Wall Street Journal, CNN, BBC, NPR, Engadget, and Wired."
