description: 'Container orchestration is critical for cloud native applications. In this session, we will introduce the patterns and practice to extend the Docker swarm mode for better support for workloads in cloud. E.g. building distributed machine-learning infrastructure on top of GPU-Accelerated clusters with Docker to streamline the continuous learning; provide diverse delivery model enhancement (i.e. blue-green deployment etc.) to allow users to treat elastic web application delivery more controllable and repeatable. And all of them are supported in declarative way by Docker Compose template'
