language: English
recordingDate: 1422960396
description: "What we'll talk about:\n\nXMPP has existed since 1999 to power a wide range of open­-standard and open-­systems communication applications, particularly instant messaging. But is it up to facing the challenges presented by the modern mobile era, where users often have multiple devices? Due to the nature of mobile networks, and the fact that users may be moving around while they are using a chat application, losing reception can result it lost connectivity and lost messages. Users switching between devices also expect to have their chats synchronised, so that they can pick up where they left off on a different device, while having a complete history of their conversations available to them. Some commenters have noted that XMPP was not designed for modern­-day smartphone-­based instant messaging. However, as an alternative to proprietary IM contenders, XMPP still remains the best available tool to bring fully featured instant messaging systems to the market in a minimal amount of time while adhering to open standards.\n\nWho will talk?\n\nMichal Slaski specialises in distributed and high availability systems, server architecture, XMPP networks, services for mobile devices, teaching Erlang, speaking at conferences.\n\nHe's heading Erlang Solutions' Krakow office in Poland, keeping the Erlang flag up high. He organised various Erlang related events across Poland. In 2014 he started the Lambda Days conference in Kraków."
