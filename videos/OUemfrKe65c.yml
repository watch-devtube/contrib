description: "Google I/O 2009 - Coding for Life -- Battery Life, That Is\r\n\r\nJeffrey Sharkey\r\n\r\nThe three most important considerations for mobile applications are, in order: battery life, battery life, and battery life. After all, if the battery is dead, no one can use your application. In this session, Android engineer Jeffrey Sharkey will reveal the myriad ways -- many unexpected -- that your application can guzzle power and irritate users. You'll learn about how networking affects battery life, the right and wrong ways to use Android-specific features such as wake locks, why you can't assume that it's okay to trade memory for time, and more.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
