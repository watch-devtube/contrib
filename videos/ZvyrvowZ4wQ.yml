description: "We've updated the Facts about Google sample to use Cloud Functions for Firebase instead of Cloud Functions as Sachit shows in the video.\n\nFYI: API.AI changed its name to Dialogflow!\n\nDownload the Facts about Google sample: https://g.co/dev/Facts-About-Google\nVisit the Actions Console: https://console.actions.google.com\nCheck out the documentation: https://developers.google.com/actions/\nJoin our G+ Community: https://g.co/actionsdev\n\nJoin Sachit Mishra (https://google.com/+SachitMishraDeveloper) for a screencast on building an Assistant app for Actions on Google using API.AI.\n\nApps for Assistant are an exciting new way to interact with your users through the Google Assistant. They provide a conversational interface between you and your user, and they are super simple to build with API.AI. You can build all sorts of Assistant apps, from games and services, to smart home automation.\n\nAPI.AI is a developer platform for building conversational experiences. It is also the easiest way to build apps for Assistant. The platform provides Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tools for developers to design unique conversation scenarios, define corresponding actions and analyze interactions with users.\n\nUsing API.AI is easy. You can get a free developer account on the API.AI website and start using the console to build and test out your conversational interactions and dialogue flow. Once you have built your Assistant app, you can integrate it into Actions on Google and submit it for approval.\n\nIf you are an Alexa Skills developer, this video will show you how to build the equivalent for the Google Assistant on devices such as the Google Home and phones.\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: https://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
