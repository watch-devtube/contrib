description: "Further information: https://foss-backstage.de/session/community-guide-contributing-mature-software-products\n\nTim works for a small company. When he comes home from work in the evening he likes to code for an open source project. This project is not just any project, but part of a product used by thousands of users in professional environments like public sector companies.\n\nCan you imagine the commit made by Tim from his family home ending up there? Yes of course! But for it to happen, some things do need to be done. Before being included in final releases and rolled out to customers, Tim's changes need to go through defined QA procedures.\n\nIn this talk, Michael Kromer from Kopano shows how communities and products work together and how Tim's commit makes it into the final release of a product: Kopano, used by thousands of users in large organizations as a replacement of Microsoft Exchange or Office365\n\nThis talk is presented by Kopano."
