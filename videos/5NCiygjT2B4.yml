title: 'How Uber Audits Real time Infrastructure of Trillion+ Messages by Ankur Bansal'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510225709
description: "As Uber continues to scale, our systems generate continually more events, inter-service messages, and logs. Those data needs go through our real time infrastructure powered by Kafka. However with scale as huge as Uber's (Trillion+ events / day), theres a strong need of Auditing to measure the completeness and reliability of the whole infrastructure. With no such solution pre-existing in open source, we created and open sourced one: Chaperone.\n\nSince January 2016 Chaperone has been a key piece of Uber Engineering’s multi–data center infrastructure, currently handling about 4-5 trillion messages / day, considering 1 trillion messages passing through 4-5 auditing stages. In this talk we are going to discuss the motivation, design, implementation challenges and the lessons learned in creation of Chaperone.\n\n# Ankur Bansal\nAnkur Bansal is a senior engineer in Uber's Streaming team. He is currently focused on building Kafka infrastructure and scaling it to keep up with uber's hyper growth. His areas of interest include distributed systems and cloud. Before Uber he worked at eBay where he was part of the founding team that built eBay's Openstack based cloud and scaled it to 1000s of nodes. He's also a Committer and PMC member in Apache Kylin."
