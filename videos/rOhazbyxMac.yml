Come hear how you can avoid giving your documents to a large\nproprietary company - and yet enjoy powerful collaborative editing of\ntext documents, spreadsheets and presentations. \n\nHear how you can host that yourself, integrated into various other\nFLOSS projects. See how the code is structured - bringing the full\npower of LibreOffice's rendering and interoperability, along with an\nincreasing amount of our feature surface to the browser. \n\nSee some demos of it in action. Hear how you can get involved with\ndevelopment, build a rich integration via scripting and integrate this\nwith your own online solution. \n\nHear about our relatively simple collaboration protocol, the thinking\nbehind it, and the great privacy, security, and even some performance\nbenefits it brings vs. traditional multiple-model, streamed composable\noperation approaches. \n\nRoom: UD2.119\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 16:40:00+01"
