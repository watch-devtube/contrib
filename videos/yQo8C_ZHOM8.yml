description: "Or, how I learned to stop worrying and love legacy code\nHannah Hazi\n\nSunday 16th, 15:30 (Ferrier Hall)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nLegacy code. It's old, poorly documented, barely tested, a nightmare to work with. You've never met the people who wrote it, but if you did you'd have a thing or two to tell them! If you had the time, you'd love to re-write it all.\n\nBut what if I told you that there are gems hidden in your company's old code? That re-writing it from scratch would be a bad mistake?\n\nThis is the story of how I learned to love legacy code. And how you might, too!\n\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for new programmers."
