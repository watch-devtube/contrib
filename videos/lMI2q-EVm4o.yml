She is regular speaker at international conferences.\n\nMastering Retrospective\n\nWhen I started with Agile and Scrum back at 2005, I was not much different from any other agile newbie, and I was complaining for having regular retrospective. “What for? We are already sitting together, we are a good team, we tell each other what should be said. It’s waste of time. Formal meeting...” . Later I realized this practice is quite useful and implemented it as one of the key practices. Lately, during past few years of my work as Agile Coach I realized I do retrospective with new agile teams and simply any group of people very often to start communication and build a first cornerstone of agile mindset - openness and trust to each other. I must admit it delivers great results which I never can achieve without Retrospective. During this talk I will share with you my experiences how to become ‘master of retrospectives’ and how to use it in all rank of different situations."
