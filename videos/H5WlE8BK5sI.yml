description: "Generics were added to the Java language more than 10 year ago. But do you really understand them?\n\nWe’ll discuss:\n\n- What is heap pollution?\n- How does the compiler translate generics?\n- Why it’s not allowed to create parametrized array?\n- What are bridge methods, can we reach them?\n- Type erasure rules\n- Difference between List and parametrized List\n- Why it’s not allowed to parameterize exception classes?\n- Code that should be compiled, but can’t be compiled and vice versa\n- How to write good API using generics and wildcards\n- And other generic puzzlers"
