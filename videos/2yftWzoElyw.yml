description: "by Andre Puschmann\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.120/sdr_lte_testbed.webm\n\n\nAfter three years without active participation, this talk is going to look back at what happened to srsLTE since then, how it evolved from a flexible PHY library to 4G UE implementation, to a full eNB and finally to a complete open-source, end-to-end 4G testbed. We'll also discuss some of the currently ongoing activities and the exciting new features that are ahead of us.
