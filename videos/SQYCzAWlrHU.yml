description: 'Micro-service systems deliver wonderful adaptability to business needs, easy scalability, and low-risk deployment. What''s not to like? You also end up with a system that''s hard to understand, measure and predict. Traditional approaches to monitoring simply aren''t powerful enough to handle the emergent properties of a system with lots of moving parts. The solution is to apply the scientific method! Anything can be measured. Uncertainty can be reduced, and stability can be an emergent property. We just have to learn the lessons that the natural world can teach us.'
