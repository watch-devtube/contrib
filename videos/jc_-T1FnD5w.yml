description: 'What makes Continuous Delivery easy and what makes it hard? Should it be all Scala + Docker + microservices or is .Net + Windows + monoliths a safer bet? This session compares and contrasts the successful continuous delivery journeys of two completely different cultures. Both achieved weekly releases to Production, but one was a .Net monolith, the other a set of Scala microservices. We’ll explore the lessons learnt by looking at the blockers and accelerators each faced.'
