recordingDate: 1533639999
description: "One of the things we - as developers - always hate, is feeling constrained by a framework. Unfortunately, historically, this has been a huge problem for ASP.NET developers. We were forced to do things in a very specific way, in a one-size-fits-all context. This had a number of negative effects, for example poor reusability, as it was difficult to achieve the code reuse we needed.\nIn this talk, we’ll look at the ASP.NET Core world, and see how we it tries to address some of the deficiencies of its predecessor. We'll look at various MVC framework components and its extensibility points. We will explore its flexibility, and how you can bend the framework to your will. We will also look at how to facilitate building reusable features."
