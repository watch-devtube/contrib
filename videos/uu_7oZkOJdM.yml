description: "Google Tech Talks\nDecember, 16 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nTITLE: Virtual Globes and Real Time Air Qualty Information: Informing the Public\nAUTHOR: Phillip G. Dickerson, Jr.\nABSTRACT: A critical facet of the US EPA's mission is to protect public health. EPA is embracing new technologies to assist in fulfilling that mission. Virtual globes allow the Agency to furnish realtime air quality data and emissions information to the public through tools like Google Earth. By interfacing with a tool that is widely available and already in use by many citizens, EPA can more effectively communicate with the public. In turn, the public can get current air quality and health data that can help them avoid exposure to unhealthy air, as well as become more informed about their local environment."
