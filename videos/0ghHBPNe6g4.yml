description: 'In this lightning talk I''ll be going through some of the challenges, gotchas, WTFs and FTWs that I''ve experienced while starting to develop in Go (on Windows). Although traditionally a .NET/C# dev, I thought I should make an attempt to learn something new. Go is cool and shiny, so I thought I''d combine my love of all things Azure with the new "shiny shiny".'
