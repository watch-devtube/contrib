description: "I often worry that my colleagues are smarter than me and one day they'll discover how incompetent I really am. I try to learn everything I can and keep up with the latest technology, but is it enough? They always seem to know more. Why do I always fear my success is dependent on my ranking against others?\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore techniques I've found to build confidence as a developer. We'll discuss how to honestly inventory our skills, reframe goals, and take an authentic look at our own journey. Our increased confidence will let us escape the alluring imposter syndrome sinkhole and liberate us to maximize our contribution."
