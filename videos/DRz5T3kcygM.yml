description: "First I was afraid, I was petrified\nKept thinking I could never live without realtime interaction client-side.\nBut then I spent so many nights thinking how XML did me wrong.\nAnd I grew strong, and JSON helped me get along\nAnd so you’re back with no name-space\nI just walked in to find no silos here ‘cause its all de-cen-tral-ized\nI shouldn’t used that custom format\nXMPP and JSON is the key\nIf I’d known for just one second interoperability wouldn’t bother me.\n\nTranscript & slides: http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/lloyd-watkin-youve-played-with-realtime-lets-do-it-properly.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
