description: 'The Java language has passed its 20th anniversary, and with it comes an incredible range of tools libraries to choose from; sometimes there are actually too many choices for the same task. This presentation covers those libraries that have risen to the top, having proved themselves to be worthy of a place in every developer’s toolbox, for both production and testing code. It also discusses some fairly new libraries that are bound to make a big impact in the ecosystem.'
