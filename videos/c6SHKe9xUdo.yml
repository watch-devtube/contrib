See how Oracle has brought Java to iOS and enabled you to leverage your existing skills to develop mobile applications. You can build HTML5 user interfaces, integrate with native device features (camera, GPS, and so on), and use Java for the business logic—and then deploy to multiple platforms from the same code base. Come learn about the Oracle Mobile Application Framework architecture and development experience in this demo-focused session.\n\n\nAuthor:\nShay Shmeltzer\nShay Shmeltzer is a Director of product management for Oracle's Mobile and Java development tools and frameworks.
