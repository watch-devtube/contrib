description: "In this day and age, using hand-crafted servers is quickly becoming a losing proposition. Debugging a Python application that runs on custom made servers gets extremely tricky, and since apps no longer run on a single server, releases become increasingly resource intensive. It is therefore vital to have a process to control multiple servers simultaneously from a single command. This talk goes through real life and practical examples to roll out orchestration and configuration management projects using Python.\n\nEVENT:\n\nIndyPy 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nCalvin Hendryx-Parker\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEt4jTLANd8"
