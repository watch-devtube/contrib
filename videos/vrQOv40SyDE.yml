description: "** Edureka IoT Training: https://www.edureka.co/iot-certification-training **\nLooking for the right kind of development boards for your IoT projects? It obviously boils down to either the Raspberry Pi or the Arduino. Now, while both might look very similar, but they’re actually very different. They’re both designed for separate utilities and are used under different circumstances. So, it is very important to know when to use which to get the best out of your projects while keeping the entire system energy-efficient and minimal. I’ve explained how the electronic control provided by both these popular boards differ and pointed out their key differences so that you understand which one of these single board systems are better suited to the needs of your projects. \n\nSubscribe to our channel to get video updates.

It is supposed to make tremendous impacts on lives and may possibly lead to the betterment of millions of lives throughout the world. According to Cisco, over 50 million devices are expected to be connected to IoT by 2020. \nHealthcare, Logistics, Aviation, Education, Information Technology name any thing and IoT will become an integral part of all these verticals. Internet of Things is believed to bring about the singularity which will ultimately converge into becoming the Internet of Everything. IoT has, therefore, become a leading interest of technologists globally and is perceived to be the NEXT BIG THING in IT industry. Learning IoT will not only provide you a career boost but you will also be able to gain insights on how technology has affected the world and will continue to do so in the coming decades. \n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co \nCall us at US: +18336900808 (Toll Free) or India: +918861301699 \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka \n\nCustomer Review: \nMichael Harkins, System Architect, Hortonworks says: “The courses are top rate. The best part is live instruction, with playback. But my favourite feature is viewing a previous class. Also, they are always there to answer questions, and prompt when you open an issue if you are having any trouble. Added bonus ~ you get lifetime access to the course you took!!! ~ This is the killer education app... I've taken two courses, and I'm taking two more.”"
