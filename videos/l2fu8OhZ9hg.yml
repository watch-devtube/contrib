title: 'Building Desktop Applications with Electron by Catalin Fratila'
recordingDate: 1519830139
description: "Developing cross-platform desktop applications has been always a problem, each operating system has its own tools and API, thus the idea of a single code base that works across was a myth for a long time. To help with this, Electron allows people to use their web development skills to create desktop applications without needing to worry too much about the specificity of each operating system. It is a framework, developed by GitHub, since 2013, that lets users create packaged HTML, CSS and JavaScript applications that run on cross-platform systems, by combining the features of Chromium and Node.js. The talk will be focused how you can create your first app. We will look at what components and features Electron offer and the benefits and downsides of the framework.\n\nCatalin Fratila, Skype\nSoftware Engineering Lead at Skype, based in Prague, Czech Republic. Joined Skype in August 2013, started with web development for the Skype logged-in user experience, then moved to create Azure micro-services for the Skype Web Client and for more than 1 year been leading the Electron at Microsoft team, focusing on building cross-platform desktop applications. Other than that, have been in software development for the past 12 years, on a various range of projects, from web, to micro-services and desktop applications. If I am not coding, you will probably find me in a gym or travelling around the world.\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp"
