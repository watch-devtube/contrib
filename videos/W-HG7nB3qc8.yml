description: "What’s the status quo of the serverless hype? However, it’s time to look at the first \"\"lessons learned\"\". Not only for beginners in the serverless world, it’s important to take into account some pitfalls, which no one wants to run in a second time.\n\n\"\"No server\"\" doesn’t mean \"\"No Ops\"\"! - The responsibility for correctness and reliability is still at our side and cannot be omitted. We discuss appropriate use cases of \"\"Serverless\"\" – and such, where serverless doesn’t suit. We also cover things to consider when it comes to topics like programming model, container handling, caching, latency, security, monitoring and deployment chains, etc."
