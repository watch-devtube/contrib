description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLightning Talk: Weaviate Vector Search Engine - Enhancing Cybersecurity - Bob van Luijt , SeMI Technologies\n\nThis talk is an introduction to the vector search engine Weaviate. You will learn how storing data using vectors enables semantic search and automatic data classification. Topics like the underlying vector storage mechanism and how the pre-trained language vectorization model enables this are touched. In addition, this presentation consists of live demos to show the power of Weaviate and how you can get started with your own datasets. No prior technical knowledge is required; all concepts are illustrated with real use case examples and live demos. Although Weaviate could be applied in a broad set of use cases, Weaviate has high potential in cybersecurity. Automatic classification of attacks, clustering of incoming threats, and better search through data in the security realm could improve the cyber security of systems and assist security analysts in analysing and preventing attacks."
