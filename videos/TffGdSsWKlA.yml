description: "Data Science coding challenge time! The popular Data Science competition website Kaggle has an ongoing competition to solve the problem of earthquake prediction. Given a dataset of seismographic activity from a laboratory simulation, participants are asked to create a predictive model for earthquakes. In this video, I'll attempt the challenge as a way to teach 3 concepts; the Data Science mindset, Categorical Boosting, and Support Vector Regression models. I'll be coding this using python from start to finish in the online Google colab environment.
