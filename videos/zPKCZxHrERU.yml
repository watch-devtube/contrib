description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nBuilding the Cloud Native Telco with Network Service Mesh - Ivana Atanasova & Radoslav Dimitrov, VMware \n\nNowadays, the rapid technology development, significant increase of the number of connected devices and overall generated traffic, are challenging the networking solutions to evolve fast. Those solutions would hardly meet the higher demands for scalability and resiliency without adopting a cloud-native approach. Therefore, network service providers, like ISPs and Telco operators, are at the point of looking for a way to adopt the new cloud-native paradigm for their sophisticated network demands. Network Service Mesh is a CNCF project that offers a potential solution. In this talk we are going to introduce the approach Network Service Mesh is using to solve complicated L2/L3 challenges in Kubernetes and provide an example of building real cloud-native network topology using the tools provided by the NSM project. We are also going to show a demo of that topology implementation with NSM.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZepE"
