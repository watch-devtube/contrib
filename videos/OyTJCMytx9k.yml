description: "JavaScript is an imperfect programming language. It’s weakly-typed, scoping rules and type coercion can make difficult-to-diagnose bugs, and cross-browser compatibility sometimes feels like a pipe dream. But does it matter?\n\nJavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world, and continues to grow year after year. How did that happen? Has JavaScript succeeded despite its warts, or did its shortcomings help pave the road to its widespread adoption?\n\nIn this talk, I’ll argue that judging the merits of JavaScript solely as a programming language is missing the point, and to accurately weigh its place in the world, you must consider JavaScript beyond types, scope, and syntax. You’ll walk away with a deeper appreciation for the feat of human cooperation that is the World Wide Web, and how JavaScript became one of the Web’s most important threads.\n\nJavaScript is here to stay. Let’s learn to love it together.\n\nTara Vancil\nGlitch\n@taravancil\n\nTara is a developer at Glitch, the friendly community where anyone can build websites, apps, bots, and more.
