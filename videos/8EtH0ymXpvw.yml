description: "Deep Dive: Linkerd - Oliver Gould, Buoyant \n\nThe 2.0 release of Linkerd marks a substantial shift in both technology and purpose for the project. In this talk, we describe Linkerd’s evolution from 1.x’s “service mesh” focus on platform-level problems for platform operators, to a 2.x “end user” focus on giving Kubernetes users the ability to debug, inspect, and manipulate the traffic runtime of their services. We describe Linkerd’s shift from a Finagle, Netty, and JVM-based stack to one built on Rust and Go, how we incorporated lessons learned from the Conduit project, and what the future of Linkerd holds. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/H3Ij"
