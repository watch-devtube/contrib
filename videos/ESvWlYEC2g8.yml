recordingDate: 1366147762
description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012.\nSpeakers:Jags Ramnarayan and Guillermo Tantachuco\nNewSQL is a term that describes the next generation of highly distributed, scalable, memory oriented SQL databases. In this session, we will explore some basic concepts in NewSQL (VMWare SQLFire), translate a traditional \"Star\" schema to a partitioned schema(scale out design), walk through various SQL usage patterns -- simple queries, complex joins, aggregations, stored procedures and explain how they can be more effectively realized in SQLFire through replicated tables, partitioned tables, in-memory or disk resident tables, parallel procedure execution, distributed transactions, etc.\n\nWe will also compare and contrast various NewSQL features with traditional SQL."
