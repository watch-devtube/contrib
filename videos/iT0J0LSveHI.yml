description: 'Implementing Mobile Payment APIs will not just improve the user experience, but increase the chance of maintaining your users. Thanks to the safety nature of the process of payment, the APIs will make the decision of clicking "pay" easier like never before. In this presentation we will discuss the basics of implementing the APIs, the available gateways, and show some demos and how they resonate in the era of PWA. We will also discuss the current limitations, and how the future will look like towards standardizing those APIs.'
