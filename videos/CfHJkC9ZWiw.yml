description: 'Chinese market has great potential, but if you are thinking about sharing the big cheese, you might want to think twice. Designing for the Chinese market can be quite tricky for Western designers, especially if they are tasked with adapting a website that was designed for Latin alphabets to one using Chinese characters, or designing a website especially for the Chinese Market. Lu will talk through the crucial differences between Chinese and Western web design, from layout and colour, cultural aspects, technology trend, through to the Chinese typography such as the gigantic character sets.'
