description: 'When we started the Brackets open-source code editor project, we wanted it to become a sandbox for people to easily prototype innovative tooling ideas for HTML, CSS, and JS. In this talk, we''ll show off some crazy new tools for things like visualizing asynchronous code flows and advanced live JS development that have all been built on top of Brackets.'
