title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Masters of the Universe: Live-coding a React Application'
recordingDate: 1493346897
description: "She-Ra, an advanced server-side champion, has heard a lot about the React\_framework. He-Man, an expert browser-side warrior, has seen a lot of different Drupal data layers. Separately, they may fail at delivering a successful application. But with their powers combined, they can become MASTERS of the UNIVERSE*.\n\nIn this presentation, we'll be live coding both the back-\_and the front-end of a decoupled React application. We'll be using Drupal Console to generate the services, and React Scaffold to generate the components. This presentation is perfect for React developers looking to dip their toes into Drupal, Drupal developers wanting to take a peek at React, and Architects looking to understand how the two combine.\n\nIn this session, participants will:\n\nExperience\_the thrill of a live-coded presentation!\nSee how to spin up services with Drupal Console, and an application with React Scaffold in under 20 minutes!\nGain knowledge how to protect your work against React's licensing!\n* Some assembly required. Castle Greyskull sold separately. Not suitable for developers under the age of five."
