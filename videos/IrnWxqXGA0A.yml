title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Mastering Drupal 8’s Libraries API'
recordingDate: 1493172348
description: "If you’ve ever had to overwrite a module’s css file or a core javascript library in Drupal 7, you likely remember the experience. And not because it was a glorious encounter that left you teary-eyed at the sheer beauty of its ease and simplicity.\n\nThe FOAD technique and the other ways of including of excluding assets are gone. Along with Drupal 8 came the Libraries API and whole new way of managing libraries through a series of yaml files.\n\nThe Libraries API grants developers flexibility and control over their css and js assets including the ability to overwrite core libraries, add libraries directly to templates, specify dependencies and more. It’s a big improvement, but it can be a bit of a learning curve to get up to speed on the new system.\n\nThis session is for beginner to intermediate front-end developers with at least basic experience theming in Drupal 7 or Drupal 8. You’ll learn how to leverage the Libraries API in Drupal 8 for granular control over how and where css and js assets get added and support new front-end development trends including component-based theming and atomic design.\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nMatt Jager has been interested in development since he first programmed his TI-83 graphing calculator to do his homework in middle school. He currently applies his 8 years of Drupal and front end experience as tech lead and front-end developer at Aten Design Group in Denver, Colorado. He is passionate about creating beautiful, user-centric experiences and also how developers can leverage mindfulness and yoga to be happier and do better work."
