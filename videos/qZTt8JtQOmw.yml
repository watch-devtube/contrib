description: "We look more closely at specific levels of the memory hierarchy and some of their properties.\n\nFor an explanation of how programmers interact with compilers and processors this is a good book: Bryant, O'Hallaron - Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective.\n\nWhen I say that performace isn't just desireable but crucial I'm paraphrasing Casey Muratori. For an argument on why programmers should think more about performance and optimization, try this video over at Handmade Hero: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_z9VN1m2Oo#t=3822\n\nThe demonstration part of this video is coming soon, I ran out of time to give it a proper treatment.\n\nNew video every Thursday.
