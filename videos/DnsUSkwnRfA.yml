description: "Brian Duggan. Perl 6: Superglue for the 21st Century\nThe Perl Conference in Amsterdam\n9 August 2017\n\nThe modern programmer is faced with a vast number of systems and tools which provide endless combinations of services and interfaces to solve multiple overlapping problems. In this talk, I discuss using Perl 6 to effectively wrangle AWS, Slack, Github, Chef, Jira, Jenkins, and other services in order to improve automation without any loss of sanity. Some of the techniques employed include grammars, concurrency, command-line argument parsing, and testing. \n\nhttp://act.perlconference.org/tpc-2017-amsterdam/talk/7073"
