description: "In 2017 the REA Group inked a deal with the National Australia Bank to partner on providing home loans to the millions of Australians who spend time on realestate.com.au looking for property and lifestyle information.\n\nFrom Day 1 it was recognised that Australian business history is littered with the carcasses of failed mergers between our biggest institutions and organisations that represent the new digital economy, and that this REA-NAB partnership would require something special from an engineering, culture and governance perspective.\n\nIt only took 8 months for the moment of truth to arrive - an engineering riddle , wrapped in a cultural mystery, inside a governance enigma. The team that came together had to find a new path, a third way of solving the technical roadblocks that had arisen through complex system architectures and data integration necessary to satisfy our customer's needs.\n\nSix key lessons were drawn from the August 2017 moment of truth for the two engineering organisations, that should provide inspiration to others planning partnerships of this scale in future.\n\nJeremy is the Engineering Manager for REA Group's new Financial Services business, building a team from scratch and delivering the first release in 9 months - all while building an integration with a big 4 bank. \n\nOver the past 20 years, Jeremy has built software and led teams across a range of industries during some changing times - telcos/ISPs in the late '90s, banking and financial services in the mid '00s, a startup or two and now digital media. \n\nAll this has led to plenty of great lessons that inform his passion for building great teams and software which deliver experiences for users.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.a"
