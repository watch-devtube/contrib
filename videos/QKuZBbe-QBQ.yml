description: 'Fast approaching it''s third birthday, the Twitter API has spawned thousands of applications that extend functionality of the basic microblogging service. Some applications mature, while others fade away. The methods and data available through the API continue to evolve, as does the Twitter community, to create new opportunities for application development.
