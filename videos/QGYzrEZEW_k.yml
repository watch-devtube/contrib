description: 'Reactive Programming is a relatively new kid on the block: concepts like functional, async and non-blocking have been around for a while but are only now going mainstream. The server side is a front runner, with seminal works as the Reactive Manifesto and many frameworks available. But how about the mobile front-end? In this talk we will experiment with mixing the principles of the Reactive Manifesto to the Android development environment.'
