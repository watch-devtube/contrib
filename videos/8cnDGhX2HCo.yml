description: "Google TechTalks\nAugust 10, 2006\n\nMehdi Sharifzadeh is a PhD student doing research at USC this summer for Google. He will be giving a talk on his research as well as his PhD.\n\nABSTRACT\nEfficient spatial query processing in spatial databases, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and even on-line map systems requires respecting the geometric characteristics of the space of data (i.e., domain). Extracting the geometry of the data is also the ultimate target in many spatial data mining and knowledge discovery tasks. Geometric concepts such as â€œclosenessâ€? mainly depend on the distance metric defined in the space of data. Many spatial queries are seeking to optimize specific functions in..."
