title: 'Conway''s Law and Microservices. A perfect match, or not? with Andy Hedges & Adrian Spender'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526549408
description: "Microservices have often been touted as the natural output of cross-functional teams thus proving Conway's Law: that software will reflect the people structures that created that software. Indeed, at Tesco we've even applied the 'reverse Conway' manoeuvre and structured our organisation to reflect the domain-based microservices we desired.\n\nSuch an approach may well be beneficial for building software services, but what about running it in an organisation with a devops mindset? What about delivering outcomes across many microservices? Adrian and Andy reflect on the pros and cons of the 'reverse Conway' approach after several years of living this reality. In this session we'll revisit the topic and explore the operational and delivery complexities that cross-functional teams and microservices can expose and some solutions that are applicable to this challenge."
