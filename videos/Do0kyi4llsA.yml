description: "Roberto Cortez, Senior Software Engineer, Tomitribe\nOleg Selajev, Developer advocate for GraalVM, OracleLabs, Oracle\n\nWe all enjoy hearing a good success story, but the life of a software developer is also made up of disasters, disappointments, and frustrations. Have you ever deleted all the data in production? Or maybe you’ve just run out of disk space and your software failed miserably! How about crashing your server with a bug you introduced in the latest release? We can learn from each other’s mistakes. Come to this BOF to share your most horrific development story and what you did to fix it."
