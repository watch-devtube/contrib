description: "Is delivering bug-free, more efficient code easy or practical? Delivering completely bug-free software is a myth, but the mindset of trying to deliver bug-free software should be a reality. This session presents a process and a set of tools that help developers deliver less-buggy and more-efficient code. The focus is on bug elimination in all development stages. The tools integrated in the NetBeans IDE cover unit tests, static analysis, and the debugger, including visual debugging of Java Swing and JavaFX applications and the profiler. The Java coding environment and all tools support new Java 8 language features and will help you write efficient, bug-free code.\n\n\nAuthors:\nMartin Entlicher\nMartin Entlicher, software developer at Oracle Corporation, has been working on NetBeans IDE for the last 14 years.
