description: "Hadoop: Thinking Big\n\nhttp://strataconf.com/stratany2012/public/schedule/detail/26990\n\nMost organizations have limited their thinking about Hadoop. The use cases they pursue are narrow and have only scratched the surface on how to best improve business results and gain a competitive edge.\n\nThe truth is that there are just a few obstacles to overcome and a few changes in perspective, to realizing the full potential for Hadoop.\n\nThis session will provide insights into how the combination of scale, efficiency, and analytic flexibility creates the power to expand the applications for Hadoop to transform companies as well as entire industries.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by MapR Technologies"
