description: "I have studied and used methodologies for changing teams. I recognise the change patterns. I have read these, tried these and none prepared me sufficiently for the last few years. This is a story of extreme change at a pace and intensity that I never imagined.  What would you do when co-option is not an option, when the only choice is to force change?  \n\nIn this talk I will share my story and the tactics that I extracted from the experience. These, I have never heard spoken about openly. I want to change that. This is important and I want us to talk openly and honestly.\n\nAslam Khan is an African technologist and strategist. He consults to large enterprises looking to shift gears, and to startups that are off the runway trying the same. He spends his time with his friends at Samushonga, Khan and Baker where they sharpen enterprise strategy and execute on its implementation; focusing on people to lines of code and the weird stuff in between. After all, what is the value of a strategy that can’t be delivered?\n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
