description: 'I keep collecting different problems, bugs and other mystic that are so common in spring framework and transform them to puzzlers. In this season all the presented cases were taken from real projects. Sap, eBay, HP and other companies have already struggled with them. I’m going to share with you this experience of problems and solutions in the already familiar to you puzzlers format.'
