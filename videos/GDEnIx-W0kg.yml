We will learn the hot topics currently facing UX leaders, including diversity, scaling a team, career path, org structure, and design process.\n\nEvent Page: https://uxsea.org/summit-2018/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\nRecorded by:\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/m0Cd/"
