description: "Fail, Learn, Fix: Improving Security The Old-Fashioned Way\n\nBryan Payne, Director of Engineering Product & Application Security at Netflix, gives a moving, yet persuasive talk at AppSec Cali 2019. In his eloquent talk, \"Fail, Learn, Fix: Improving Security the Old Fashioned Way,\" Payne recognizes how past events hold potential in the evolution of changes of future policy. Payne cites an example of the combined effort of how the government and the military produced the building of a top-secret, multi-level, information storage resource. Bottom line: Take lessons from history on how to fail, learn, and fix problems together.\n\n\nBryan Payne\n\nI am currently leading the Product & Application Security organization at Netflix. We are paving the road for security best practices in large-scale cloud applications. We help keep Netflix secure by creating and running critical security services, consulting on security design, and identifying security problems throughout the product.\n\nI started at Netflix by leading the Platform Security team. This team is now part of the larger product security organization described above.  \n\nhttps://2019.appseccalifornia.org/\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
