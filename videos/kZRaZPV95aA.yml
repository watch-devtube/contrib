description: "As software becomes more and more complex we are in constant search for means to beat complexity and keep it simple. This aim is in contrast with turbulent and constantly changing industry so beside keeping simple we also strive to or are being forced to do things as fast as possible.\nClojure is designed with simplicity in mind. Session begins with overview of what is Clojure, core ideas behind it, it's lisp heritage, and what does it mean for programming language to be considered as powerful. Specifics of Clojure such as it's core data structures and some pecularities not available in other languages are described next. Each core concept is covered with short but representative example. Afterwards, focus is shifted from abstracts to tangible stuff, that is, technical concepts such as REPL oriented development, Java interop and tools to aid in every day work. Session is concluded with suggestions on resources to aid in learning Clojure."
