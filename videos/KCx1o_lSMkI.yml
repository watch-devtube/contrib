description: "DevOpsDays Boston 2018 - Expertise vs Experts by Yegor Bugayenko\n\nSoftware expertise is a vital component of a software project success. Software products are created by people – their skills and talents determine the result to a large extent. However, people can’t really be attached to a project forever; they change work places and companies, taking their knowledge with them. It’s a well-known fact that subject domain experts are important and dangerous at the same time. In this presentation I will share my experience of dealing with highly qualified programmers and transferring their knowledge to project artifacts. I will present a concept of experts-free software development, which is practiced in our distributed teams."
