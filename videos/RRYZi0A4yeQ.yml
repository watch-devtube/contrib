description: "Learn to draw on the web with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. We'll use primitive shapes like rectangles, circles and lines to visualize data and create generative art. We'll get a taste of D3.js to design and animate our graphics. We'll also use D3 for simple mapmaking, learning the basics of spatial visualization and geographic projections.\n\nEVENT:\n\nØredev 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nKai Chang\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nØredev Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish Øredev tech talks."
