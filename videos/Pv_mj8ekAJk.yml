description: "Cluster Health for Application Health – Monitoring the Cloud Foundry Infrastructure - Johannes Bräuer, Dynatrace\n\nYou are wondering why applications slow down although app monitoring shows no issues? Then it is worth investigating Cloud Foundry infrastructure components such as Gorouters and Auctioneers that route traffic and balance the load on VMs, respectively. Being aware of bottlenecks regarding these components leverages your capabilities in properly scaling your Cloud Foundry cluster. Consequently, a well-provisioned environment ensures the health that is required to optimize your applications.\n\nThis talk explores how monitoring can be made a platform feature that helps you to observe application health on the one hand but is also a mean to understand the well-being of the underlaying Cloud Foundry components on the other hand. A deep dive will be given in detecting component anomalies, which hit the applications’ response time and availability.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRz1/cluster-health-for-application-health-monitoring-the-cloud-foundry-infrastructure-johannes-brauer-dynatrace"
