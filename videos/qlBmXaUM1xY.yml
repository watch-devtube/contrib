description: "Four releases of Java in 15 months! A big change to how Java is delivered, but it’s not the only one. JDK 9 introduced a significant change in the form of the module system that can impact how easy it is to run existing applications. JDK 9 also started a long overdue cleanup of the JDK, removing features as well as adding them. This has continued in JDK 10 and JDK 11.\n\nIn this session, we’ll look at all the areas of JDK 9, 10, 11 and 12 that may impact application migration. This will cover all aspects: Java language syntax, class libraries and JVM options (a significant number of which have changed in these releases).\n\nWe’ll also look at how the new JDK release cadence will impact Java support and the choices of which Java versions to use in production."
