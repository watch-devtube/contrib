description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nWe will provide a brief overview including an explanation of what Unicode is, string terminology, and how Unicode supports non US languages. \n\nWe will cover the pros and cons of various String formats and encodings including UTF-8, UTF-16, UCS-4, etc. A time line of Unicode development will be shown and how other languages have handled string processing over the last twenty years. \n\nWe will provide a brief overview of where strings are used, what can go wrong with strings, why string encoding is important, and how the CsString library solves a major problem with string handling. \n\nWe will explain how the CsString library has changed our CopperSpice Gui libraries and improved string processing in DoxyPress. \n\nNo prior knowledge of Unicode, CopperSpice, or DoxyPress is required.\n— \nBarbara Geller: CopperSpice, Co Founder\n\nI am an independent consultant with over twenty-five years of experience as a programmer and software developer. I have worked with numerous smaller companies developing in-house applications. I have also designed and developed Windows applications for several vertical markets including medical billing, transportation, and construction.\n\nMy degree is in Electrical Engineering from Cal Poly Pomona with additional studies in Computer Science.\n\nI am a Co-founder of CopperSpice, a C++ library derived from the existing Qt framework. I designed the Diamond Editor, a cross-platform programmers editor using the CopperSpice libraries. I have programmed in C++, Qt, Visual Objects, Clipper, PHP, and Java.\n\n\nAnsel Sermersheim: CopperSpice, Co Founder\n\nI have been working as a programmer for nearly twenty years. My degree is in Computer Science from Cal Poly San Luis  Obispo.
