description: 'Immutability in object-oriented programming is a very important quality of properly designed classes, which help us to keep them short, maintainable, cohesive and less coupled with others. There are a few practical examples of how, thanks to making classes immutable, the entire design becomes less error resistant during refactoring and extending.'
