title: 'YOW! Connected 2017 - Patrick Catanzariti - Make that first leap into voice interfaces and AI'
recordingDate: 1510268402
description: "An ever growing ecosystem of connected devices needs newer methods of interaction and UX. While mobile applications are common for interfacing with the IoT, more and more devices make managing a growing number of apps infeasible. Rather than opening up separate apps for each intended action, voice interfaces are starting to become more powerful and commonplace with the Amazon Echo, Google Home and more bringing an expectation of voice commands to the IoT.\n\nWith voice interfaces emerging comes another expectation — intelligent responses from these voice interfaces! This is where early artificial intelligence and chatbot creation will come in handy. While these areas sound like they'd be complex to get started with, there are platforms and technologies out there today that can enable you to do a whole lot out of the box which you can build upon.\nIn this talk, PatCat will give you a crash course in voice interfaces and AI — looking at how you can get started with existing services and APIs, and how you can take all of this and apply it to your own idea or connected device.\n\nPatCat is the founder of Dev Diner, a site that explores developing for emerging tech such as virtual and augmented reality, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and wearables. He is a SitePoint contributing editor for emerging tech, an instructor at SitePoint Premium and O'Reilly, a Meta Pioneer and freelance developer who loves every opportunity to tinker with something new in a tech demo.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
