title: 'Vince Allen: Pixel Art and Complex Systems - JSConf.Asia 2014'

description: "Once defined by its limitations, pixel art has evolved into a highly expressive visual style. Illustrators, product designers and artists continually challenge the conventional pixel art sensibility to produce beautiful work for the street, our homes and museums.\nWorking in abstraction, pixel artists manipulate a simple set of design priniciples. This talk will focus on techniques to render pixel art in a web browser using JavaScript and the DOM. We値l start by drawing characters and scenes in the traditional 8-bit style. We値l also set them in motion and create framed-based pixel art animation.\nNext, we値l focus on pixels themselves and how to transform them into autonomous agents. Using the same rendering techniques, we値l create complex systems out of simple rules. As we try to balance these systems, we値l observe interesting emergent behaviors. Finally, we値l learn how to render these systems to HD video using Node.js and Photoshop.\n\nVince is a software engineering manager at Spotify in New York. He痴 been designing and programming for almost 20 years and devotes most of his spare time to FloraJS, a JavaScript framework for creating natural simulations in a web browser.
