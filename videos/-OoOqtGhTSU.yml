description: "Transforming a Bank with a Highly-Opinionated Automated Release Pipeline - Reid Levesque, Royal Bank of Canada\n\nCan development teams focus on developing business logic while avoiding the bureaucratic jungle to get to production? Microservices are great at speeding up development time and shortening the feedback loop -- unless every team has to build a pipeline from scratch. In an organization used to monthly or quarterly releases, moving to daily or hourly deployments requires more than a change in application architecture.\n\nThis session will cover how we’ve automated all the things while still giving developers the freedom to be successful. \n\nAbout Reid Levesque\nReid is a Principal Software Developer in the Cloud Platform Engineering team at RBC. He has created several microservice applications using Spring Cloud and Cloud Foundry. Reid is actively accelerating applications to production with an opinionated release pipeline. Reid has a strong development background and received his Bachelor of Mathematics in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo. He is based in Toronto, Ontario."
