description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMarty Weiner - Cloud Ninja @ Pinterest\n\nABSTRACT\nIt's been an amazing ride building Pinterest from the early beginnings to today. We've watched it grow from a handful of engineers to 150+ and from hundreds of users to hundreds of millions, in just a few years.\n\nWe'd like to take you on a tour of our evolution, with specific focus on the early days. We'll discuss how the team and technology evolved, the challenges we faced, the (many!) mistakes we made, and the successes. We go into depth about how we made technology decisions and what we would have done differently, and try to leave you with tons of info you can use immediately to improve your infrastructure.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
