title: 'The Computer Science behind a modern distributed data store, with Max Neunhoeffer'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526548923
description: "What we see in the modern data store world is a race between different approaches to achieve a distributed and resilient storage of data. Most applications need a stateful layer which holds the data. There are at least three necessary ingredients which are everything else than trivial to combine and of course even more challenging when heading for an acceptable performance.\n\nOver the past years there has been significant progress in respect in both the science and practical implementations of such data stores. In his talk Max Neunhoeffer will introduce the audience to some of the needed ingredients, address the difficulties of their interplay and show four modern approaches of distributed open-source data stores.\n\nTopics are:\n\nChallenges in developing a distributed, resilient data store\nConsensus, distributed transactions, distributed query optimization and execution\nThe inner workings of ArangoDB, Cassandra, Cockroach and RethinkDB"
