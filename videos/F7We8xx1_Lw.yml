description: "Our journey will begin in lab 100 as we explore some basic concepts of Docker, container architectures and functions. Then deploy a container based on the Twitter Feed Java REST service from a Docker image. In this lab we will leverage various Docker commands to setup, run and connect into the Twitter Feed REST Service Container.\n\nHands on Lab Material & Code: \nhttps://go.oracle.com/docker\n\nHands on Lab Setup: OCI Development Environment\nhttps://youtu.be/4-zHfxopV_s\n\nHands on Lab Overview: Containerized Development with Docker\nhttps://youtu.be/ivNEREBsH9k\n\nLab 100: Containerized Development with Docker\nhttps://youtu.be/F7We8xx1_Lw\n\nLab 200 : Containerized Development with Docker \nhttps://youtu.be/p6FU3WZlCHk"
