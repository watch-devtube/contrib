language: English
recordingDate: 1431955267
description: "In this talk we will discuss designing systems on Erlang VM. One of the reasons the Elixir language attracts the attention of developers is the fact that they have to solve certain types of problems arising in concurrent systems. We will take a look at the real tools Erlang VM gives you to write highly-available systems that let you sleep through the night: dynamic tracing and remote REPL. We'll see how these tools are used.\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- Attendees should be familiar with functional programming, actor based concurrency, pattern matching, dynamic typing, TCP/IP."
