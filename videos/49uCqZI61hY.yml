description: "Bjoern Rost\nPrincipal Consultant\nThe Pythian Group Inc.\n\nStewart Bryson\nOwner and Co-founder\nRed Pill Analytics\n\nWhile relational databases are still the king of transaction processing systems, they have a hard time keeping up with the increasing demand for real-time analytics. In this session we will build and demonstrate an end-to-end data processing pipeline. We will discuss how to turn changes in database state into events and stream them into Apache Kafka. We will explain the basic concepts of streaming transformations using windows and KSQL before ingesting the transformed stream in a dashboard application. And lastly we will explore the possibilities of adding microservices as subscribers. Live demos will be performed using Apache Kafka and Cloud infrastructure, analytics and visualization services."
