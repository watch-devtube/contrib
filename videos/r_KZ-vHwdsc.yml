description: "LISA16 - Interplanetary DevOps at NASA JPL\n\nDan Isla, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nAt the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, real-time analytics for data collected from the Mars Rover Curiosity is critical when millions of telemetry data points are received daily. Building portable containerized data systems and tools that can be continuously deployed enables our Systems Engineers and Data Scientists to quickly develop, analyze, and share their visualizations and algorithms. With the AWS GovCloud region, export-controlled data can be securely stored and processed using the familiar AWS services and APIs that scale on demand. Containers, DevOps, and high levels of automation are the most important concepts when building infrastructure at scale that can be robust and operated by just a few admins. DevOps is more than just automation and fancy tools and is really about culture change within the organization. At JPL and other government agencies, legacy is everywhere from the apps to the ops; with the Analytics Cloud Services, we have successfully demonstrated ways to modernize legacy systems using containers to make them more secure and operable on modern infrastructure. In this talk, Dan will share how his team revolutionized Interplanetary Mission Operations and created a new paradigm for software development and collaboration at JPL.\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
