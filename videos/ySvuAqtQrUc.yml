description: "Date:  June 18, 2014\nLocation:  Toronto, Canada\nWARNING:  Audio is not great, but hopefully tolerable :)\n\nSpring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly, but pleasant! Join Spring developer advocate Josh Long@starbuxman for a look at what Spring Boot is, why it's turning heads, why you should consider it for your next application (REST,web, batch, big-data, integration, whatever!) and how to get started.\n\nLearn more about Spring Boot at http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot"
