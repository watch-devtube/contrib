In the past two years, our community has grown by leaps and bounds as a result of very passionate and dedicated people as well as crucial community tools like GitHub, IRC, Slack, and Twitter. These meetups foster a collaborative, inclusive environment focused on new releases, best practices, and how customers are using Cloud Foundry. Come meet Cloud Foundry organizer for Seattle and Atlanta Kim Bannerman of IBM, Denver organizer Mark Carlson of ECS Team, London organizer Paula Kennedy of Cloud Credo/Pivotal, and New York organizer Daniel Krook of IBM along with frequent speaker and community leader Bridget Kromhout of Pivotal. Moderated by Stormy Peters, VP of Evangelism for Cloud Foundry Foundation. \n\nThe panel will discuss lessons learned, what 2016 looks like for the Cloud Foundry community, and how they have managed to grow and nurture this vibrant community. Learn best practices and tips and tricks for starting meetups in your area and retaining your devoted Cloud Foundry followers. \n\nStormy Peters\nCloud Foundry Foundation\n\nKim Bannerman\nProgram Director, Advocacy & Community, IBM\nKim Bannerman: Program Director, Advocacy and Community at IBM (Blue Box).
