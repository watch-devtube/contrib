description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nHow We Manage Our Widely Varied Kubernetes Infrastructures in Alibaba - Ziren Wan & Jie Chen, Alibaba \n\nKubernetes makes it simple to manage applications on top of clusters. But how can we continuously deliver the underlying infrastructure components and ensure the stability that new improvements will not have a negative impact on upper biz applications. In this talk, we will share our experiences to manage thousands of fully-customized Kubernetes infrastructures at Alibaba and present details about how to efficiently manage control plane components and widely varied operators. Also, this talk will take a small dive into the topic of how we improve cluster stability by building inter-cluster and intra-cluster gray release pipelines and testing clusters with extensive conformance tests and e2e canary tests. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp8Q"
