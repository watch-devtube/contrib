Chas will address this question and others in his tech talk.\r\n\r\nMicroclinic International and the Organic Health Response (OHR) have partnered to spread \"contagious health\" solutions among the remote populations of Lake Victoria in Western Kenya through an indigenous network of HIV/AIDS prevention collectives. Chas Salmen, the OHR-MCI HIV/AIDS Initiative Director, will speak about the Ekialo Kiona Center on Mfangano Island, which features a solar-powered computer center, VCT, and clinic rooms.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see http://microclinics.org/ and http://organichealthresponse.org.
