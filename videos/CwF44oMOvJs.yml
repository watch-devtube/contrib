description: "Speaker: Steven Yap, Founder, Futureworkz\n\nBuilding real-time app is painful for the frontend, painful for the backend and even painful for the database. We will share how we build a real-time CRM app using React, Redux, Rails and RethinkDB (we call it the R4 framework) that is easy to reason and easy to build. Put fun back into real-time app development!\n\nSpeaker's Bio\nSteven Yap is a full-stack coder, agile coach and development consultant. He balances his life with Buddhism teachings and seeks enlightenment through coding and the work he is involved in. He founded and runs Futureworkz, a Singapore Agile agency since 2005. Steven Yap hosts the monthly Ruby Meetup in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam - Saigon.rb.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.reddotrubyconf.com\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/ONqI/"
