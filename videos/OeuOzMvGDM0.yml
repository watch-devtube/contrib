description: 'With Edge computing becoming an emerging trend, we see more and more developers trying to use Kubernetes outside typical data center deployments. And it makes sense, as people want to continue using all cloud-native best practices and tools that make them productive. IoT Edge working group introduces a community where all aspects of using Kubernetes in IoT and Edge use cases is discussed. In this session, we’ll introduce the working group, share some of the interesting topics discussed so far and provide an invitation to participate in future activities.'
