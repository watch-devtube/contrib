description: "“Why Clojure?!” is a question I’m asked frequently as the CTO of a startup using Clojure and ClojureScript as our foundational languages. Is Clojure really appropriate for a growing company with multiple teams of developers? Why not choose something more mainstream? This talk will answer these questions, and reflect on more than a year of development on a complex application with a large engineering team.\nDerek Slager is the CTO of Amperity, a Seattle based company building an at scale data platform with Clojure and ClojureScript."
