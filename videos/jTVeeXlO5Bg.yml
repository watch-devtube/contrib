title: 'Where’s My UI? The 2014 JavaOne Web App UI Smackdown'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433260723
description: "The original JavaOne web application smackdown was nine years ago now, and can you believe that we as an industry are still trying to figure it out? Of course you can. So much has changed in the practice of building web applications that it’s natural to have more questions than answers. This panel discussion seeks to address these questions and get some hot topics out into the open. The panelists represent technologies that take a wide range of different approaches to solving questions of UI state, programming model, conceptual burden, runtime performance trade-offs, and many other vital concerns. You may not have answers to all your questions after hearing this panel, but you will be more assured that you are at least asking the right questions.\n\n\nAuthors:\nEdward Burns\nEd Burns is a Senior Staff Engineer for Oracle Corporation where he chairs the JSR 344 (JSF 2.2) Expert Group and contributes to the open source Mojarra project.
