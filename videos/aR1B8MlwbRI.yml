description: "Get the code here: http://goo.gl/B6rbz\n\nWelcome to my Template Method Design Pattern Tutorial. It is an extremely easy design pattern to understand and use.\n\nWith this pattern, you define a method (algorithm) in an abstract class. It contains both abstract methods and non-abstract methods. The subclasses that extend this abstract class then override those methods that don't make sense for them to use in the default way.\n\nIt may sound complicated, but it definitely isn't. It is also extremely useful. Look at the code above to get a complete understanding quickly."
