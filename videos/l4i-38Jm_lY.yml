recordingDate: 1523570397
description: 'Too often we hear that for any business larger than freelancing, complex and proprietary CMS solutions are the only option. But in a world where the statement "go to the office" can no longer be easily defined, and the term "successful" takes on so many different faces, so should the definition of an MVP for a CMS. Join Josepha Haden Chomphosy as she takes a brief look at the historical underpinnings that make this conversation contentious, and how the future of the mid-market CMS is open source and worth being a champion for.'
