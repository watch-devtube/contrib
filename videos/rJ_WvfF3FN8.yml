description: "The Web was envisioned as an open platform for publishing and sharing information, but that vision has been lost: most people will never publish independently on the Web. What went wrong?\n\nWe値l see how a core facet of the Web platform耀etting up and running a server様ocks the vast majority of users out of participating in the Web. Finally, we値l take a look at the peer-to-peer Web, an experiment to re-imagine Web publishing, this time without servers.\n\nFeeling skeptical? I値l build and deploy a website on-stage using only my browser and text editor.\n\nOMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
