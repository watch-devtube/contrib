Support the show by becoming a Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/funfunfunction\n\nToday, I’d like to talk a little bit about switching jobs, when it is time to do it and what criteria to look for when picking the next job. \n\nMy advice is to think about if the workplace you're considering will give you autonomy in your work, if you think that your role will make you feel relatedness to a larger whole, and finally define your next job, that you *can’t get*, and ask yourself this job will grow your competence in the direction of that.\n\n?
