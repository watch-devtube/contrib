description: "Do you want a single endpoint to access your data? Fetch only the data your client needs all in a single network request? Evolve your API without versions? Well if the answer is yes to any of these questions then GraphQL might just be what you are looking for. GraphQL is a query language for your application and not your database. With GraphQL, developers can use composable typed queries to request and receive only what’s required from the server.\n\nWe’ll walk through an introduction to GraphQL, drawing comparisons with traditional RESTful API’s, highlighting the implications on server and client design. Live coding examples will be used to illustrate how to get started creating a GraphQL server including: defining a schema, connecting to a database, fetching/manipulating data and much more."
