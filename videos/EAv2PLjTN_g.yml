description: "Speaker: Anton Davydov, Indie OSS Developer\n\nHanami is quite new and interesting framework which you are unlikely to write complex applications. But this does not mean that this framework is not worth your attention. Besides old approaches, you can also find new interesting solutions. In my presentation, I'm going to talk about Hanami framework and why you should look on this. We give consideration about advantages and disadvantages. And also I talk about future with Hanami.\n\nSpeaker's Bio\n\nAnton is an indie developer from Russia. He works on some side projects and builds Space-Rocket ships at night.
