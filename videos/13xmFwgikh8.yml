description: "by Lukas Kramer\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.125/horizon.webm\n\n\nHorizon is a from-scratch EDA package with focus on useful parts management and rule-driven design. It has already proven it's suitability for medium-complexity projects in the board design for my master thesis. This talk covers my motivation for starting a new EDA package in 2016 and the main ideas behind horizon as well as some unique features. I'll also go into my short- and long-term plans for the project. \n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 13:30:00+01"
