description: "RubyConf 2018 - The Atonement of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Caleb Thompson\n\nThe Nazi party members at Nuremberg, J. Robert Oppenheimer at Los Alamos, and developers at exciting tech companies have something in common. The responsibility for what mark we leave on the world through our efforts or inventions rests on our own shoulders. We cannot push this burden to those who tell us what to do, and so we must be conscious about what it is that we're building and how it will be used. The repercussions of our actions come back to us if not legally, then weighing on our conscience."
