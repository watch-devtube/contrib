description: "It’s great to have a solid base of unit and integration tests; they give us confidence about the overall system integrity. But at the end of the day, it all amounts to whether our end users are happy using our application. So how can we keep the fail whale at bay and communicate with the stakeholders that the requirements are being met?\n\nNot too long ago, running tests that were going beyond isolation was a challenging task. This required a well thought out process as part of the automated build. Nowadays we are equipped with a “Swiss Army knife” for almost all aspects of testing. Along this journey, in the world of testing, we will take a closer look at some of these tools.\n\nWe will learn that the Arquillian ecosystem is way more than just integration testing; it’s a comprehensive testing platform. We will dive into the concept of Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) and demonstrate how to build higher-level, end-to-end functional tests; we will be emulating user interactions using the Arquillian Drone extension together with the open source browser automation tool Selenium. Reusable components like Page Objects will make our tests cleaner and easier to maintain. Eventually we will sugar coat them with a Groovy DSL for Behaviour Driven Development to achieve testing nirvana.\n\nIf you care about quality of your software you definitely shouldn’t miss this talk!"
