title: 'ElixirConf 2021 - Chris Freeze - Using Simple Patterns to Solve Complex Problems with ChoreRunner'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635005334
description: 'In a real-world situation, the course of action that brings the most business value isn’t always the most elegant solution—I’m sure I’m not the only one who’s ever remoted into a production application and copy-pasted Elixir code, or had to interface with some legacy portion of a business that’s still using emailed excel documents to operate an enterprise-scale operation! There will always be the need for one-off scripts to be run in your apps. This can be a recipe for disaster if there’s something wrong with your code! At PepsiCo, we decided to create a system for these kinds of one-shot tasks that aims to minimize the risk potential while maximizing business velocity and developer productivity, which we call “Chores”. In my talk, I’ll explore the implementation and features of our library, go in-depth about the philosophy behind them, and explore some of things I learned along the way! And to make sure I cover my buzzwords, there will be meta-programming, LiveView, and OTP!'
