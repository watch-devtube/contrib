title: 'Nordic.js 2018 • Lauren Budorick - The Matrix is Everywhere: A Primer on Projections in Web Graphics'
language: English
recordingDate: 1544608488
description: "Graphics programming is more accessible than ever, thanks to the ubiquity of WebGL and popular frameworks that handle the boilerplate stuff. But for many of us, as soon as we see “projection matrix” (or worse, “linear algebra”) we panic.\nBut it turns out the matrix is nothing to fear! With the help of some fun visualization tools we’ll learn all about what matrix transformations actually mean on your screen. You’ll leave empowered with a better understanding of how to translate any kind of 3D scene onto a 2D screen in JavaScript, so that you can start writing new WebGL visualizations faster than you can say mat4.scale(...).translate(...).rotateX(...).rotateZ(...).translate(...).scale(...).invert().\n\nLauren Budorick\nLauren grew up loving math, art, computers, and maps, so it is the happiest of accidents that she fell into graphics at Mapbox, working on Mapbox GL, an open-source map rendering engine, and more recently at Figma, building vector graphic design tools for designers like her former self. She studied public policy and art at Duke University, then learned to code at Hackbright Academy. Her first programming project was a routing engine for runners to avoid the treacherous hills of San Francisco and she's been building mapping and design technologies ever since.\n\n\nNordic.js is a single track conference with talks by internationally renowned speakers and rising stars in the JavaScript community.
