description: 'Kent Beck wrote the book on TDD in 2002 a lot of words have been dedicated to the subject. But many of them propagated misunderstandings of Kent''s original rules so that TDD practice bears little resemblance to Kent''s original ideas. Key misunderstandings around what do I test, what is a unit test, and what is the ''public interface'' have led to test suites that are brittle, hard to read, and do not support easy refactoring. In this talk, we re-discover Kent''s original proposition, discover where key misunderstandings occurred and look at a better approach to TDD that supports software development instead of impeding it. Be prepared from some sacred cows to be slaughtered and fewer but better tests to be written.'
