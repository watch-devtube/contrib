recordingDate: 1418328301
description: "This presentation was recorded at Chicago's GOTO Night \nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nCharles Nutter - Co-Leader of the JRuby Project\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Java platform is nearly twenty years old, and continues to be the dominant platform for writing high performance services. The Java language is evolving again, adding features like lambda expressions that people have needed for years. Releases come out more often, and security has been made priority one. But what about the JVM? Is it moving forward too?\n\nWe'll look at a brief history of the JVM's evolution, focusing on OpenJDK and its roots in Sun Microsystems. We'll talk about some of the challenges of evolving the JVM and some of the key players involved. Then we'll start our journey into the future, exploring next-generation garbage collectors, new language runtimes, JIT optimizations and improvements, and native library features...all of which are in progress to be released in future versions of OpenJDK. t's a thrilling time to be using the JVM, and this talk will show you why.\n\nDownload the slides here: \nhttp://slidesha.re/1yDrBu1\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
