description: "Nuspell: version 3 of the new spell checker FOSS spell checker implemented in C++17 with aid of Mozilla\nby Sander van Geloven\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.120/clc_nuspell_version_3_of_the_new_spell_checker.webm\n\nNuspell version 3 is a FOSS checker that is written in pure C++17. It extensively supports character encodings, locales, compounding, affixing and complex morphology. Existing spell checking in web browsers, office suits, IDEs and other text editors can use this as a drop-in replacement. Nuspell supports 90 languages, suggestions and personal dictionaries. In this talk we will summarize the functionality of Nuspell version 3 and provide easy to follow examples on how to use it as a command-line tool or link to the C++ library. Newly made integrations in Firefox and Enchant will be discussed. The audience will be invited to further integrate Nuspell into their software, create new language bindings, port it to other operating systems and help grow its community. This new spell checker has outgrown from an MVP to a faster and more complete spell checker.\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 15:30:00"
