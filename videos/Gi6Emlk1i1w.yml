description: "by Adam Samalik\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.3.401/linux_distributions_lifecycles_containers.webm\n\n\nDeploying software has lots of solutions, but what gets deployed often plays out as a fight between developers and operators. Developers want the latest (or at least later) code. Operators want things in nice packages, certified, and with a known period of support. What we need is a catalog of software with the variety of versions the developers need, with the qualities expected by the operators. Come and learn how various projects within Fedora approach this problem from different perspectives, including Fedora Modularity, containers, Fedora CoreOS, and Fedora Silverblue. This session contains a high-level overview as well as a live (or recorded) demo of Fedora Modularity — a project bringing multiple versions of packages in Fedora with the qualities expected from a Linux distribution: transparently built and delivered, actively maintained, and easy to install. In other words, having the flexibility that developers need and the qualities operators need. \n\nFollowed by a demonstration of why building containers using Linux distributions' packages makes your life easier. And now with Modularity there's more versions of software to choose from. \n\nEnding with a quick intro into container distributions for the server (Fedora CoreOS) and for the workstation (Fedora Silverblue) —\_demonstrating the benefits of having an immutable small OS which is possible thanks to applications in containers. \n\nExpected audience: system administrators and developers \n\nCome and learn how developers and operators can be friends by using packaged software from Linux distributions, and what Fedora has to offer to both! \n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 09:55:00+01"
