description: "In this month's episode Rick Viscomi and Jeff Posnick (Google Chrome Developer Relations) discuss the state of service workers. Service workers are a new kind of worker that gives progressive web apps more control over how resources are loaded over the network and cached. Jeff discusses some of the reasons why it might be a good idea for a website to include a service worker, some common mistakes developers make when implementing them, and how the Workbox tool can help.\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYXXGNFJjwc"
