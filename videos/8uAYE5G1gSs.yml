description: "Colt McAnlis, Grace Kloba \n\nChrome implements fast, powerful webpage rendering by using the graphics hardware (GPU). But powerful GPU rendering introduces a new suite of issues that web developers need to understand. For example, how often is the texture cache invalidated? How can using translate-z cause GPU performance issues? How do hidden divs affect the GPU compositing process? \n\nAttendees will walk away with a clear understanding of the GPU compositor in Chrome and knowledge of how their design choices will impact a page's performance on devices with GPU compositing.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
