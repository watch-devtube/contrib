description: "Many developers harbour the dream of throwing off the shackles of corporate serfdom and experiencing the glorious freedom of self-employment. So is the grass really greener on the other side? As a developer who took the plunge a few years ago, I can offer some honest feedback and practical advice on things like:\n\n   1.  what to consider when assessing whether self-employment is right for you.\n    2. the different software development business models, the pros & cons of each.\n    3. setting up a business/company - which structure is best.\n    4. knowing when to quit your job.\n    5. pricing yourself correctly.\n    6. sales & marketing - critical activity or soul destroying waste of effort?\n    7. why on earth can’t people just pay you on time.\n    8. what to say to friends and relatives who think you don’t do anything all day.\nAnd generally everything else that I know now, that I wish I knew then.\n\nSam has a background in .NET enterprise development, but now works mainly on mobile apps & cloud services. He’s been an Apple fanboy since the 80s, and was coding Objective-C before it was cool. He mainly develops in Swift, Elm & F# these days, and actively tries to avoid writing any JavaScript.\n\nSam runs the Perth-based software consulting company codesplice, and organises the Perth iOS developers meetup group.\n\n\nFor more information on YOW!
