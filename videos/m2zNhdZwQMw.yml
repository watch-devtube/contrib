description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2012\n\nwww.erlang-solutions.com\nwww.erlang-factory.com\n\n\"ADTECH's ad delivery systems have traditionally been built using C++ technology. When the time came to build a real time bidding ad delivery system the team felt that traditional approaches would not be able to scale to the requirements that such a system would demand. The team undertook a very short investigation and then embarked on a journey to transform themselves, in a very short period of time, into an Erlang development group despite having no previous experience of the language. This talk is about that journey and some of the lessons learnt in the process.\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory  https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory \nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory  http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
