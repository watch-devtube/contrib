description: "It’s no longer acceptable to develop large, monolithic, single-language, single-framework Web applications. In this session, you will learn how to use the scale cube to decompose your monolithic Web application into a set of narrowly focused, independently deployable services. The presentation discusses how a modular architecture makes it easy to adopt newer and better languages and technologies. You will learn about the various communication mechanisms—synchronous and asynchronous—that these services can use.\n\n\nAuthor:\nChris Richardson\nChris Richardson is a developer and architect with over 20 years of experience.
