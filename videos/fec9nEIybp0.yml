There are lots of such intros out there even manifestos. We hope this is the one where you don't get lost and it makes sense. Get a definition of what \"reactive\" means and why it matters. Learn about Reactive Streams and Reactive Extensions and the emerging ecosystem around them. Get a sense for what going reactive means for the programming model. See lots of hands-on demos introducing the basic concepts in composition libraries using RxJava and Reactor."
