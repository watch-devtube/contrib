title: 'Detox: Graybox End to End Tests and Automation Library for Mobile Apps - Rotem Mizrachi-Meidan'
recordingDate: 1504508614
description: "https://github.com/wix/detox\n\nHigh velocity native mobile development requires us to adopt continuous integration workflows, which means our reliance on manual QA has to drop significantly.\nThe most difficult part of automated testing on mobile is the tip of the testing pyramid - E2E. The core problem with E2E tests is flakiness - tests are usually not deterministic. React Native makes flakiness worse due to the async nature of the bridge.\n\nRotem believes the only way to tackle flakiness head on is by moving from blackbox testing to graybox testing and that's where detox comes into play. The library synchronizes with the lifecycle of the app, including React Native core, making tests finally deterministic.\n\nAfter struggling with solutions like Appium, the team decided it's time for a new library, providing easy cross-platform testing API in JavaScript. Detox is used in production."
