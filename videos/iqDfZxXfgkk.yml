description: "Emmanuel Paraskakis\nSenior Director, Product Management\nOracle\n\nWouldn’t it be great to show others what your API will look like before writing a single line of code? In this session, we get hands-on with API Blueprint to see how you can use Apiary and its mock server to create a fully documented API spec that you can share and collaborate on with others. Learn how to use free online tools to create a working prototype that you can use with your front-end application. Be sure to bring your laptop."
