description: "Apache Flink Meetup Berlin  27.05.15\n\nSlides:  http://de.slideshare.net/robertmetzger1/apache-flink-hands-on\n\nOver the past years, we've seen many new Flink users. In this talk, Robert will answer the most frequent asked questions. \nThe talk is interesting for both new and existing Flink users. New users will get a good overview of the system from a user's perspective and existing users will probably find some hidden gems in the talk."
