description: 'The ultimate goal has been set to run Erlang on microcontrollers with under 0.5 Mb of memory. This is a story about the ongoing project and multiple approaches that have been considered and taken on this way. We will need to reinvent a new code representation, a new runtime and possibly new standard libraries. The ride is going to be rough!'
