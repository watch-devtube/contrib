description: '[BETTER AUDIO RE-UPLOAD] #Codemotion Rome 2017 - Virtual Reality is an undoubtedly ideal storytelling platform, whichever the story. After starting with the very first VR comic in the world, "Magnetique", a GearVR exclusive, we''ll focus on telling virtual reality stories without resorting to 360° videos. Drawing techniques, stereoscopic coding, sequential art tips and tricks. And more. Our times allow for a unique opportunity to tell old stories, anew.'
