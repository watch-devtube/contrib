description: "Speaker: Burr Sutter and Kamesh Sampath from Redhat\r\n\r\nJava EE has been the dominant enterprise Java standard for well over a decade. However, in recent years there has been confusion and concern around its future promoting new efforts such as Eclipse MicroProfile to take just enough Java EE into the world of cloud and microservices. But all of that changed in 2017 when Oracle announced that, working with Red Hat and IBM, they were donating all of Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation and to be rebranded as Jakarta EE. What does this mean for the future of enterprise Java and traditional Java application servers? In this session we’ll get a rapid history lesson and then an idea of where Jakarta EE is heading and how customers and communities can help drive the future of enterprise Java through 2020!\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/singajug/events/250928272/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Allan Chua & Michael Cheng\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/jQjm/"
