description: "United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a component of the United States Department of Homeland Security, partnered with Pivotal to enable their Digital Innovation & Development team (DIDit) change the way USCIS develops software. They adopted a sophisticated approach to user-centric design, they learned to apply Lean Startup to software development, and they now practice a highly disciplined approach to Extreme Programming (XP), all of which is underpinned by a platform optimized for automation and cycle time, Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). In the past 1 years, Pivotal and USCIS have built applications that focus on the adjudication of Immigrant VISA applications and Refugee Asylum processing. The business impact has been extraordinary, illustrated by metrics such as a 98% reduction in the time to process work order requests for a key immigration form, 80% reduction in the time to process Asylum Pre-Screening Officer cases, and 356% increase in production deployments! DIDit is building a reputation within USCIS as the team that delivers powerful business outcomes at startup speed.\nSpeakers: \nThomas Baird\nSoftware Engineer, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (DHS)\n\nMatthew Dosberg\nChief, Digital Innovation & Development - DID(it), US Citizenship and Immigration Services (DHS)"
