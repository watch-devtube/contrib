description: "What could be better than doing work that you believe really matters?\_Whether you’re pulling all-nighters for a new startup, burning the midnight oil on the project of your dreams, or helping launch a candidate into public office, it’s hard to beat the thrill of making a difference.\n\nThat passion has a dark side, though: When everyone’s giving 110%, the margin for error vanishes and the potential for burnout skyrockets. In this talk, we’ll look at the ways inspiring missions and the best intentions can backfire, learn to recognize the danger signs, and discuss how to protect ourselves and our teams."
