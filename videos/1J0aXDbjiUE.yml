title: 'GTAC 2013: Appium: Automation for Mobile Apps'
language: English
recordingDate: 1367254739
description: "http://g.co/gtac2013\nSlides: http://goo.gl/IuvKF\n\nJonathan Lipps, Sauce Labs\n\nAppium is is a Node.js server that automates native and hybrid mobile applications (both iOS and Android). Appium's philosophy dictates that apps should not be modified in order to be automated, and that you should be able to write your test code in any language or framework. The result is a Selenium WebDriver server that speaks mobile like a native. Appium runs on real devices and emulators and is completely open source, making it a wonderfully friendly way to get started with mobile test automation. In this talk I will outline the principles that inform Appium's design, talk about Appium in the space of other mobile automation frameworks, and introduce the architecture that makes the magic happen. Finally, I'll dig into the code for a simple test of a brand-new mobile app, and demonstrate Appium running this test on iPhone and Android."
