description: "The need for gleaning answers from unbounded data streams is moving from nicety to a necessity. Netflix is a data driven company, and has a need to process over 1 trillion events a day amounting to 3 PB of data to derive business insights. To ease extracting insight, we are building a self-serve, scalable, fault-tolerant, multi-tenant \"Stream Processing as a Service\" platform so the user can focus on data analysis. I'll share our experience using Flink to help build the platform.\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://BashFilms.com"
