description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nThe Hotspot JVM already provides a lot of runtime optimizations for Java applications. However this is not the case when we want to execute Ruby or JavaScript code in the JVM, for example. The Graal VM is an Oracle Labs research project that aims to improve the runtime compilation of the JVM in order to bring the performance of Java to interpreted languages."
