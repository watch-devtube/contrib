description: "You are devoted to minimize coupling and duplication? You are taking care to maximize cohesion, flexibility, extensibility, encapsulation, testability, and even performance in order to achieve the high goals of (object-oriented) programming? Awesome! But wait: You still you favor member functions? Seriously? You have been deceived! You have been praying at the altar of false promises! Shed the shackles of Java philosophy! Free your functions!\n\nIn this talk I will demonstrate why in C++ free functions should generally be preferred to member functions, and why free functions - not member functions! - provide you with all the aforementioned advantages you expect from object-oriented programming."
