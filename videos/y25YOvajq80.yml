title: 'Ben Hale — Java Buildpack Year in Review (Cloud Foundry Summit 2014)'
recordingDate: 1403915255
description: "At the last Cloud Foundry conference, the Java Buildpack was introduced as the easiest way to run Java applications in the cloud. Since then the buildpack has only gotten better. Contributions from both Pivotal and the open source community have greatly enhanced the Cloud Foundry Java application experience. This talk explores the new application types that can be run and the new services we can integrate with. It also touches on HTTP session replication across instances and finally will touch on the packaged and offline buildpacks.\n\nSpeaker:  Ben Hale, Java Experience Lead, Cloud Foundry at Pivotal"
