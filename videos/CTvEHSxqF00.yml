description: "In this presentation I will show some of the advantages of using the Groovy language.\n\nGroovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-typing and static compilation capabilities. It runs on the Java platform (JVM) and is in many ways a superset of Java. The learning curve for the average Java is described as a \"small speed bump\" while the powers are described as \"Java on Steroids\"."
