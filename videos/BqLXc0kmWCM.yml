description: "It's a Mob! How We Gained Shared Knowledge and Delivered Value with Quality Faster - Cai Cooper, Fiserv & Colin Simmons, EngineerBetter\n\nHow do you manage when you need a team to implement something brand new, not well understood and complex?\n\nJoin Cai Cooper from Fiserv and Colin Simmons from EngineerBetter as they discuss how they utilised Mob Programming techniques to help the Fiserv Finkit team move towards a better system of deploying and operating their Cloud Foundry foundations and other supporting tooling.\n\nDuring this talk you will hear how Mob programming helped the team more effectively share knowledge, ensure a common understanding baseline and remove single points of knowledge (solving the Brent problem for those of you familiar with the Pheonix project!). Additionally, you will see how common myths associated with Mob Programming can be debunked. We will show that far from being wasteful, in fact there is a reduction in waste and an increase in quality as a direct result\n\nCai and Colin will share tip and tricks, what worked well and things to look out for and provide some guidance on what you can do with your own teams to try it out.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyt/its-a-mob-how-we-gained-shared-knowledge-and-delivered-value-with-quality-faster-cai-cooper-fiserv-colin-simmons-engineerbetter"
