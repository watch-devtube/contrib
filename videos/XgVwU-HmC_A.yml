description: "This talk was recorded at CukenFest London 2018\n\nhttp://cukenfest.cucumber.io/\n\nThe concept of the testing pyramid was introduced by Mike Cohn many years ago. Although a lot of people have heard about it, there are not many who are actually implementing it. Maybe one reason for this is that the pyramid helps us to map the tests to the testing technology only (unit, integration, UI), but not to the purpose, the different testing goals.\n\n\nThe concept of testing iceberg helps to map the business-interesting tests targeted by BDD to the pyramid, but this is just the start. In this session I going to share 9 different, funny test automation shapes that I have seen, to inspire you to find your own, context-driven test automation strategy."
