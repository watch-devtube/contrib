description: "Running Cloud Foundry in a Compliance and Security Focused Environment - Diego Lapiduz and Bret A. Mogilefsky, 18F\n\nRunning Cloud Foundry in a compliance and security focused environment (Diego Lapiduz and Bret Mogilefsky, cloud.gov - 18F). cloud.gov has adopted Cloud Foundry to host applications for government users in the cloud, tackling one of the core impediments to government service delivery today. In the process of doing that we had to turn up the security of the platform, write composable compliance documentation, and build tools to automatically scan the system and tenant applications. These processes and tools have been built in the open so other members of the community can contribute to them and reuse them in other contexts. \n\nThis talk will show how Cloud Foundry and Bosh made it easy to centralize security and enable redeployment of the whole platform. We will also talk about how we built reusable and composable compliance documentation that can be shared publicly. \n\nDiego Lapiduz\n18F\nDiego is a software architect turned DevOps practicioner. He is currently leading efforts to deploy software applications more efficiently at 18F. Earlier in his career, he worked on projects ranging from e-commerce to social networks. Diego is often a frequent guest speaker at conferences, where he talks about software architecture, DevOps and other ramblings.\n\nBret Mogilefsky\nGSA/18F\nInnovation Specialist\nSan Francisco, CA\nBret Mogilefsky is an Innovation Specialist at 18F, the agile design and development consultancy inside government, for government.
