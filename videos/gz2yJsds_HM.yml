title: 'Lambda Days -  Aleksander Nycz - Erlang in practice -- victories and defeats'
recordingDate: 1397653957
description: "Finally Erlang has become a mature and widely used programming language. The most powerful Erlang functions focus on processes and messages, thus, developing soft-real time, high availability and scalable applications is easier and faster than ever before.\nI would like to show you how to use Erlang to help develop real time applications in practice. I will also emphasize the strongest and the weakest language features. I would like to present some patterns and technical aspects that will help you develop and maintain real time applications, including: load regulation, background processes, consistency recovering, resource management, statistics and monitoring, and tracing. In brief, I will present how to create concurrent programs that \"run forever\"."
