description: "Google Tech Talks\nDecember 9, 2005\n\nElisabeth Hendrickson\n\nABSTRACT\nAs more teams are adopting Agile practices such as XP and Scrum, software testing teams are being asked to become \"Agile\" as well. But what does that mean? Is the Agile label yet another buzzword? Or could it be Agile practices are actually changing the way software is built? In this talk Elisabeth Hendrickson shares her perspective on how test teams can be more Agile based on her experiences working as a tester on Agile teams. Along the way, she'll provide an overview of how Agile practices differ from traditional practices and discuss what those differences mean for independent test teams.
