title: 'Driving to UI Test Heaven - Gabriel Grinberg'
recordingDate: 1532587501
description: "Testing UI is hard - the amount of platforms, the vast choice of technologies and the lack of a clear API, all lead to testing implementation details instead of the actual feature.\n\nIn this talk, Gabi presents a design pattern called “Component Drivers” that had a huge impact on UI testing at Wix, and shows how we can take this to the next level and reuse component test code in browser/e2e testing code in different platforms, making QA automation much simpler!"
