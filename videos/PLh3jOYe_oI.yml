title: 'Grails Worst Practices'
recordingDate: 1449226800
description: 'Using Grails can be hard. Shortcuts, lazy coding practices, and coding without understanding what you''re doing is often a lot faster than taking extra initiative and following best practices. In this talk we''ll look at approaches for getting a sloppy, unmaintainable and slow Grails application to production. We''ll borrow techniques from other languages and frameworks such as PHP, for example database access from the view layer, putting business logic wherever we feel like, cryptic naming conventions and heavy use of optional typing, and more!'
