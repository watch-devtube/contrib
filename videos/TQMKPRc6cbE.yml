title: 'Turning the JVM into a Polyglot VM with Graal'
language: English
recordingDate: 1502110706
description: "Many programming languages need a virtual machine (VM) to run programs on. There are really fast ones, such as Oracle’s HotSpot for Java and Google’s V8 for JavaScript, but if you are using a language where the standard VM doesn’t have the same kind of technology, such as Ruby or Python, you’re out of luck. The Graal VM is an effort to take the kind of technology that is in the Java VM and make it available for implementing many other languages, so they can all have a fast VM and all work together in the same VM. This makes it possible to have faster programs, written in the languages that you want to use. This is the one VM to rule them all. Attend this session to learn more.\n\nSpeaker: Chris Seaton"
