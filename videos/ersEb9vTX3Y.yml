description: "Miško Hevery says, that while most users are happy with the current state of web apps, most developers aren't. From a desire to make more dynamic applications, using fewer and more readable lines of code, AngularJS was born.\n\nThis presentation, delivered for The San Francisco HTML5 User Group, uses a series of demos to give a thorough introduction to AngularJS.
