description: "The Life of a Kubernetes Watch Event - Wenjia Zhang & Haowei Cai, Google \n\nThe watch event is essential to the kubernetes architecture. It’s the key to maintaining high availability in the kubernetes control plane. Have you ever wondered how a watch event is propagated? In this presentation, we will cover how kubernetes delivers a watch event through control plane storage, API server, and finally to clients, and what happened to a watch event across server replicas. Attendees will leave with a full understanding of the life of a kubernetes watch event, which could help you make better decisions to implement your controllers in a much more scalable and performant way. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrUX"
