description: "Google I/O 2010 - Next gen queries \n\nApp Engine 301 \n\nAlfred Fuller \n\nThis session will discuss the design and implications of improvements to the Datastore query engine including support for AND, OR and NOT query operators, the solution to exploding indexes and paging backwards with Cursors. Specific technologies discussed will be an improved zigzag merge join algorithm, a new extensible multiquery framework (with geo-query support) and a smaller more versatile Cursor design."
