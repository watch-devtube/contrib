description: "Amidst a the hype and buzz of wearables, the stark truth is that to date most have failed to deliver life-impacting benefits. But there is one exception, and surprisingly it’s in the world of elite sport. Aussie business Catapult Sports invented the category almost a decade ago, and today is an ASX-listed public company worth close to $200m and ranked as the 12th most innovative company globally by Fast Company magazine. Executive Chairman Dr. Adir Shiffman will reveal the tech behind Catapult’s ability to reduce injury and boost performance, what is driving its global growth, and how it came to be the world leader with over 700 teams globally including the AFL, NRL, NFL, NBA, EPL, NCAA D1 College, EU Soccer, and many, many more.\n\nOriginally a medical doctor, Dr. Adir Shiffman is the Executive Chairman of Catapult Sports, the world’s largest provider of wearable athlete analytics to elite sports teams. Catapult is a publicly listed company traded on the ASX with a market cap of approximately A$200m. Catapult has over 700 clients in 32 countries across dozens of sports including all teams in the AFL and NRL, and large numbers of clients in the NFL, NBA, college sports, EPL, and European soccer. Their technology helps teams improve the health, safety and performance of players and ultimately win more games and championships. Teams who have used Catapult as part of their championship success include NBA Champions Golden State Warriors, NCAA College Football Champions Florida State University, and NFL Champions Seattle Seahawks.\n\nAdir began coding at the age of 12 and founded his first tech company at the age of 15. In 1995 at the start of telco deregulation he founded a small long-distance provider whilst still a medical student, and sold it three years later to a consortium of Deutsche Telecom, France Telecom, and Sprint. In the past 20 years Adir has founded, built and sold numerous technology companies including comparison website HelpMeChoose (sold to Mortgage Choice), Global Reviews, and digital agency Innovate Online (recently sold to Nunn Media).\n\nIn addition to his role at Catapult, Adir continues to be an active investor, mentor, serial entrepreneur, and Chairman of ASX-Listed Disruptive Investment Group. In 2014 he was rated the World’s 10th Most Innovative Person in Sports Business.\n\nFor more on YOW! Connected, visit http://connected.yowconference.com.au"
