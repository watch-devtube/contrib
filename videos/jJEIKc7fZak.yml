description: "Startups are in it to make money—whether by breaking even, being acquired, or finding some other exit. But for data-driven startups, turning bits into dollars can be a challenge. There are privacy issues, data ownership concerns, and questions about how to monetize the business. This panel of investors and entrepreneurs will look at strategies for generating money in data-driven startups.\n\nDavid Schwab\n\nSierra Ventures\n\nDave joined Sierra in 1996 and has built the firms software investing practice. Dave's professional career began at Lockheed Corporation in the engineering department where he managed a group of software developers building guidance and control systems. Following his tenure there, he joined Sun Microsystems where he spent 5 years in sales and sales management positions. In 1991 Schwab co-founded Scopus Technology with a fellow Sun sales manager and two other executives. While at Scopus, he served as Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Scopus was taken public and subsequently acquired by Siebel System.\n\nDave holds Masters and Eng. degrees in Aerospace Engineering from Stanford University and an MBA from Harvard University.\n\nPaul Kedrosky\n\nKauffman Foundation\n\nDr. Kedrosky is an investor, speaker, writer, media guy, and entrepreneur. In his spare time he is a dangerous Twitterer, analyst for CNBC television, and the editor of Infectious Greed, one of the most popular financial blogs available over the Interweb.\n\nIn the dusty distance of long-ago, Dr K. founded what he is reasonably sure was the first hosted blogging site, GrokSoup. After having grown it to be one the largest such services on the Interweb (admittedly before there were other such services), he demonstrated his unerring ability to enter fast-growing markets before they take off, and exit before they have grown large enough to deliver an island-purchasing exit. The rest is history, or least an index entry in one book on blogging.\n\nTodd Papaioannou\n\nBattery Ventures\n\nTodd Papaioannou is an Entrepreneur in Residence at Battery Ventures, where he works alongside the Enterprise IT investment team to evaluate investments in Big Data, Analytics, and Cloud Computing infrastructure.
