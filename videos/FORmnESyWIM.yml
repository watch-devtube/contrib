description: "Ask for the unreasonable… and then get out of the way\n\nAs a senior technical leader, it’s often viewed as a temping trap to get down into nitty-gritty details of software engineering or product development. As a CTO, Head of Engineering or equivalent, we’re supposed to play at the strategic level and leave the details to our engineering leads, aren’t we?\nWell… yes. And no. Sometimes, creating a strategy and leaving it for our teams to figure out ignores the fact that our organisation constrains our teams in ways that we don’t expect. Sometimes it’s actually necessary to venture down into the weeds and see what the teams are doing - and what we’re doing that actively harms their efforts despite our intentions to the contrary.\nIn this talk we’ll look at some ways to map strategy to execution by setting “unreasonable” goals - and then working out how to get organisational constraints - and ourselves - out of the way.\n\nAndrew is a Principal Consultant at ThoughtWorks and a co-founder at Stack Mechanics. He is a solutions architect and software engineer with interests in large-scale, high-load, geographically-distributed systems. He specialises in project rescue, governance and development methodologies, and in creating cultures of engineering excellence.\n\nAndrew's main areas of interest are domain-driven design, event sourcing, scalable service architectures and cloud computing. Andrew's mother wrote COBOL on punch cards and he has been coding in one form or another since he was five years old.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
