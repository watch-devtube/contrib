description: "NoSQL is a very diverse space, given that the only common denominator between these databases is that they don’t use SQL. This session provides a casual overview of the NoSQL database landscape of today. It compares and categorizes a wide range of modern databases, highlighting the difference between various types of databases while providing insight into when each type of database is the most appropriate solution.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTobias Lindaaker\nTobias Lindaaker is a software developer at graph database company Neo Technology, developers of Neo4j--the world’s leading graph database. Tobias has always been a tinkerer, taking things apart to understand how they work and then putting them together again to make them better. When he first encountered Neo4j in 2007, his programming language of choice was Python. In order to make Neo4j and Python play nicely together, Tobias undertook the task of updating Jython to support the language constructs of Python 2.5. His journey has taken him deep within the expanses of Python, Java, the JDK and Hotspot. He has delivered code contributions to each, and holds a bare-metal familiarity of matters from language implementation to concurrency--all which help him drive the machinery of graph databases as a member of the Neo4j core team today.\nView more trainings by Tobias Lindaaker at https://www.parleys.com/author/tobias-lindaaker\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
