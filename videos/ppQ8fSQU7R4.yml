description: "For a free trial of basic C programming tutorial, sign up here: \nhttp://edureka.co/courses/details/c-programming-n-data-structures\n\nIn this video we are going to teach you how to use pointers in place of an array.\n\nPointers and Arrays in C is a very important concept of basic C programming. A lot of beginner C programmers have trouble understanding this concept. The C programming tutorial video begins by stating that it is always possible to use pointers as arrays. To master writing programs in C, one must have a thorough knowledge of pointers. \n\nC pointers are important concepts and this C video tutorial lecture makes understanding them easy. Programming C tutorial for beginners given by Edureka is a 4 week course. \n\nIn the first week, you'll get to learn basics of computers, memory organization, writing your first C program, data types and operators, variables and qualifiers. In the second week, you'd learn control flow, while, for, Do while loops, functions in C, recursion, arrays and strings in C. \n\nThis particular basic video tutorial is a part of what you'll learn during the third week. During the third week, you'd learn pointers in C, pointer arithmetic, multi dimensional arrays, dynamic memory allocation, structures and linked lists. During the final week you'd learn unions, searching and sorting, file operations, string functions, and tests to showcase your skills in C programming basics.   \n\nHappy Learning!! \n\nTeam Edureka\nwww.edureka.co\nsupport@edureka.in\n+91-9886359989"
