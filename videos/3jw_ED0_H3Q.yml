description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune 19, 2006\n\nABSTRACT\n\n\n\nSVG is an XML vector graphics standard that is gaining momentum on the web. It is supported by most browsers (IE with a plug-in) and fills a need for vector graphics in the high resolution environments that webpages are finding themselves in while still providing graphics rich experiences to mobile users with smaller file sizes. This talk will go into the SVG standard and how to easily make SVG documents using Inkscape. Inkscape is a cross-platform Open Source vector drawing tool that is based on the SVG standard."
