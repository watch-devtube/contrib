description: "Google Tech Talks\nMay, 29 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nArms races among invertebrates, intelligence gathering by the\nimmune system and alarm calls by marmots are but a few of nature's\nsecurity strategies that have been tested and modified over billions of\nyears. This provocative book applies lessons from nature to our own\ntoughest security problems—from global terrorism to the rise of infectious\ndisease to natural disasters.\nWritten by a truly multidis-\nciplinary group including\npaleobiologists, anthropologists,\npsychologists, ecologists, and\nnational security experts, it\nconsiders how models and\nideas from evolutionary\nbiology can improve national\nsecurity strategies ranging\nfrom risk assessment, security\nanalysis, and public policy to\nlong-term strategic goals. \n\nSpeaker: Terence Taylor\nTerence Taylor is the Director of the ICLS and the Chairman of its Board of Directors. He has held leadership positions at The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), the United Kingdom 's Ministry of Defense and the United Nations.

He is an expert in international security policy, with a special emphasis in risk assessment and non-proliferation. \n\nMr. Taylor served as the co-director of the project entitled \"Safeguarding the Advances and Managing the Risks: the Future of the Life Sciences\" during his time at IISS -- US. This effort, over the period of three years, led to the emergence of the International Council for the Life Sciences as an independent organization to help develop and promote global biosafety and biosecurity standards. He serves on the U.S. National Academy of Sciences Forum on Microbial Threats and is an adviser to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Mr. Taylor was also a member of the National Research Council Steering Committee on Genomic Databases for Bioterrorism Threat Agents and served as Chairman of the Permanent Monitoring Panel on Risk Analysis of the World Federation of Scientists. \n\nTerence Taylor is a regular contributor to a variety of publications including The Washington Quarterly, International Herald Tribune, and The Wall Street Journal, in addition to authoring numerous book chapters on humanitarian law and biological weapons.

He has served as a Geological Society of America Congressional Science Fellow in the office of U.S. Representative Hilda Solis. He has also convened a working group and is publishing a volume on using biological evolution as a guide for improving societal security systems. \n\nRafe has taught ecology and global change science and policy at California State University Monterey Bay and at University of California , Los Angeles . His research has appeared in Science, Nature, Ecological Monographs, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, Foreign Policy and other leading journals."
