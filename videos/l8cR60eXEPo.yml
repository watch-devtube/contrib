description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Chicago 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nStreaming data is found everywhere: IOT devices, self-driving cars, social media, financial markets, and more. Processing such data involves aggregation, extraction of statistical data, online learning, behavior prediction, and acting on results on-the-fly -- forming a processing pipeline. Functional Programming can be used to effectively deal with these pipelines.\n\nIn this talk, I will show how functional programming concepts can be used with streaming data, with a specific application of real-time robot control, where all data is streaming. I will introduce Potassium, a Scala framework that facilitates the use of Scala collection-like APIs for processing sensor and computer vision data and sending control signals to actuators. We will explore how robot control systems can be modeled with functional concepts such as applicative functors. The net effect is elegant decomposition of robot systems where components can be implemented and tested in isolation but easily connected in production.\n\nClassical robot algorithms such as digital filters and controllers map directly to functional programming concepts and can be implemented concisely while maintaining high performance. We will explore streaming data used with Akka actors and streams for communication between multiple processing units on a robot and for streaming live data for diagnostics. Finally, we will take a quick look at how React can be used with Scala.js for implementing reusable components for displaying streaming data with “Funky Dashboard”, an open-source streaming data visualization tool that can be easily deployed in your own environment."
