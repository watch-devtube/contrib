title: 'Reactive Modeling of Automotive User Interfaces with JavaFX'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433254526
description: "User interfaces for automotive infotainment systems are developed for various models, brands, and markets at Volkswagen Group. Inspired by an OSGi-based app framework from Volkswagen Group Research, a development migration using JavaFX is under investigation. Besides a demonstration of framework variants, apps, and skins, an alternative to state chart modeling is presented to manage a large number of views within a complex application. The alternative models are easy to understand, modify, and maintain and are suitable for specification and development. They cover variants and scale very well. The implementation in JavaFX benefits from lazy evaluation and invalidation listeners and perfectly integrates into the pulse-driven Quantum Toolkit. Learn more in this session.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJens Ehrke\nJens Ehrke studied computer science at the Technische Universität Berlin. He started his career at the Robert Bosch research center for software technology, and today works as software architect for Volkswagen Group Research. From the early days of Java, he focused on Java user interfaces. That included modeling and simulating user interfaces for clients such as Blaupunkt, Olympus, Samsung, Siemens, and Audi. Currently, he investigates the potential of JavaFX for automotive infotainment systems at Volkswagen Group.\nView more trainings by Jens Ehrke at https://www.parleys.com/author/jens-ehrke\n\n Simon Gerlach\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by  Simon Gerlach at https://www.parleys.com/author/simon-gerlach-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
