description: "http://www.oscon.com\nBruce Eckel is the author of Thinking in Java and Thinking in C++, and a number of other books on computer programming. Atomic Scala by Bruce Eckel and Dianne Marsh will be published in April 2013. He's been in the computer industry for 30 years, periodically gets frustrated and tries to quit, then something like Scala comes along and offers hope and sucks him back in.\n\nHe's given hundreds of presentations around the world and enjoys putting on alternative conferences and events like The Java Posse Roundup. He is currently studying organizational dynamics, trying to find a new way to organize companies so that working together becomes a joy; you can read about his struggles in this arena at Reinventing-Business.com, while his programming work can be found through www.MindViewInc.com.\n\nhttp://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/speaker/150837"
