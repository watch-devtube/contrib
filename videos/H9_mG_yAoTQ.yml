title: 'Building a Safer Web: Web Tripwires and a New Browser Architecture'

description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch, 10 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWeb content has shifted from simple documents to active programs, but\nweb protocols and browsers have not evolved adequately to support them.\n As a result, safety problems in web sites and web browsers now\nregularly make headlines, from browser exploits to ISPs that modify web\npages. In this talk, I will discuss my research into improving the\nsecurity and reliability of web content and browsers.\n\nFor most of this talk, I will focus on one particular problem: the\nability for intermediaries to modify web content in-flight. Our recent\nmeasurement study shows that many clients now receive web pages that\nhave been altered before reaching the browser. The changes range from\ninjected advertisements to popup blocking code to malware, often\naffecting the user's privacy and security. Some of these changes\nintroduce bugs and even vulnerabilities into the pages they modify.\nMost sites are unwilling to switch to SSL for reasons of cost and\nperformance, so I will show how web servers can use \"web tripwires\" to\ndetect in-flight page changes with inexpensive JavaScript code.\n\nAfter this, I will talk more broadly about my research on web browser\nsecurity, focusing on the deficiencies of today's web as an application\nplatform. Starting from my prior work on BrowserShield, I will show how\nwe need a safer architecture for running programs within the browser.\nLike an operating system, this new architecture will need effective\nmechanisms to define, isolate, and enforce policies on these web programs.\n\nSpeaker: Charles Reis\nCharles Reis is a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science &\nEngineering at the University of Washington, studying with Steve Gribble\nand Hank Levy. His current research focuses on improving the security\nand reliability of web content and web browsers. In the past, he has\nalso worked on models of wireless interference with David Wetherall.\nCharles received a B.A. and an M.S. in Computer Science from Rice\nUniversity, where he worked with Corky Cartwright and Peter Druschel.\nAt Rice, Charles was the second lead developer for DrJava, a widely used\neducational programming environment."
