title: 'From imperative to reactive thinking | Todd Motto & James Henry'
language: English
recordingDate: 1511174474
description: "In this talk, we will look at how using reactive programming effectively requires us to think a little bit differently about our code and how the different pieces fit together. We will walk through real code examples and compare and contrast imperative and reactive approaches to the same problem. We will use the example of Angular to show how reactive programming is becoming increasingly important in both the framework's design and application.\n\nSlides:\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/toddmotto/from-imperative-to-reactive-thinking\n\nSpeakers:\n\n- Todd Motto:\nTodd is a front-end engineer from England, UK. He runs Ultimate Angular, teaching developers and teams how to become Angular experts through online courses.\n\n- James Henry:\nJames loves empowering other developers to do their best work. He does this through building tools (he is a member of the ESLint core team, a collaborator on Prettier and a TypeScript evangelist) and through speaking and training for Ultimate Angular."
