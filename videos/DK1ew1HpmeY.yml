In this session, you'll learn first hand from someone whose job is helping customers fix these problems. Using Docker and Docker Data Center, you can keep your apps running smoothly with minimal downtime. In this session, you'll learn how to apply your troubleshooting skills in the Docker ecosystem, including: 1. Identification and characterization of the problem. 2. Command line tools to inspect networking and namespaces. 3. Applying these skills to your workloads on OSS Docker and on DDC."
