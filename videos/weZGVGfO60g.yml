description: "Serverless is the most clickbaity title for an actually interesting thing. Despite the name, Serverless does not mean you’re not using a server, rather, the promise of Serverless is to no longer have to babysit a server. Scaling is done for you, you’re billed only for what you use. In this session, we’ll cover some key use cases for these functions within a Vue.js application: we’ll accept payments with stripe, we’ll gather geolocation data from Google Maps, and more! We’ll make it all work with Vue and Nuxt seamlessly, simplifying how to leverage this paradigm to be a workhorse for your application.\n\nEVENT:\n\nVue Amsterdam 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nSarah Drasner\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nVuejs Amsterdam 2019 - Buy your earlybird tickets now!\nhttps://goo.gl/En32JA"
