title: 'DistributableStream: A Java 8 Stream Computational Model for Big Data Processing'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433260737
description: "With lambda expressions and the Stream API, Java 8 becomes a highly powerful and expressive programming language that supports queries on in-memory data collections. These new Java features have shed light on a Stream computational model that enables users to easily process big data across multiple computational platforms. This session describes DistributableStream, the Java abstraction that supports distributed and federated query. DistributableStream builds on Stream, supporting execution of generic queries on any registered compute engine. At execution time, each portion of a DistributableStream is assembled as a local stream that represents data partitions locally stored on each machine.\n\n\nAuthors:\nGarret Swart\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Garret Swart at https://www.parleys.com/author/garret-swart\n\n Kuassi Mensah\nKuassi Mensah is Director of Product Management for Database Access Drivers, Frameworks and APIs including JDBC, Java in the Database, UCP, DRCP, Application Continuity and In-Database MapReduce.\n\nMr Mensah holds a MS in Computer Sciences from the Programming Institute of University of Paris VI.
