description: "VR videos allow you to look in every direction and convey a sense of depth so near things look near, far things look far. Spatial audio completes the experience with sound that responds to where you're looking. Combined, these deliver compelling, immersive cinematic experiences in which you feel like you’re actually there. Learn about Google’s efforts to improve production and delivery of this new medium.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
