language: English
recordingDate: 1458222234
description: "we will have two presentations in one — the first part will be about writing applications in NodeJS and the second part will be about deploying and running applications in the Heroku cloud. \n\nThe application will be a standard web application using ExpressJS to handle routing and PostgreSQL as a database to store persistent information that is being received from Twilio using a web hook. Great stuff if you want to learn more about running javascript server-side. \n\nDuring the second part the developed application will be added to source control and deployed to Heroku. We will be looking at adding add-ons, how to do logging and how to scale our application. \n\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
