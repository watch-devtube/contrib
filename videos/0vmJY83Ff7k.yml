title: 'YOW! West 2015 Fred George - Agile Roots: Use JIT to Go Faster'
recordingDate: 1514472866
description: "Agile borrowed from the JIT manufacturing processes originally at Toyota. The Agile Manifesto itself summarized the key aspects brought into programming from JIT.\n\nOriginal Agile processes like eXtreme Programming (XP) brought breathtaking speed of delivery to a waterfall world. But Agile has not stood still. From XP’s original (and aggressive) 2­3 week iterations, we now see individual programmers pushing new functionality to live systems several times a day!\n\nAcceleration drives changes to an organization’s processes and skills, just as the original shift to Agile from waterfall. Organizations reluctant to address such changes, however, inhibit the acceleration. Indeed, their attempts to accelerate often result in lower morale and flawed delivery; these failures drive conservative (and destructive) attitudes against change.\n\nIn this talk, we will address a myriad of drivers for faster delivery:\n\n* Available technologies, including Cloud, languages, and new frameworks\n* Shift toward active monitoring rather than one­time acceptance testing\n* Refined, lighter processes consistent with shorter cycles\n* Architecture that is fault­-tolerant rather than provably perfect\n* Shift toward trying ideas rather than firm requirements\n* Reduction in role specialists\n* Reduction in delivery team size\n\nFor each of these drivers, we will describe teams that have taken these steps and the corresponding accelerated delivery.\n\nFred George is a developer and co­founder at Outpace Systems, and has been writing code for over 46 years in (by his count) over 70 languages. He has delivered projects and products across his career, and in the last decade alone, has worked in the US, India, China, and the UK. He started ThoughtWorks University in Bangalore, India, based on a commercial programming training program he developed in the 90’s. An early adopter of OO and Agile, Fred continues to impact the industry with his leading­ edge ideas, most recently advocating Micro­Service Architectures and flat team structures (under the moniker of Programmer Anarchy). Oh, and he still writes code!\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
