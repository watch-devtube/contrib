description: "Ionic, ngrx and Angular: building web and mobile apps with one code base\n\n\n\nIonic is amazing and boringly easy. If you already know Angular, you can get an app on the App Store in record time.\n\nCome learn how to build an Angular web app, an Ionic mobile app and maximise the code re-use between the two with ngrx and custom npm packages. We will help you get your head around ngrx and the redux pattern and share with you a bunch of tips and tricks to save you time and avoid common pitfalls. At the end of this talk you will know how to create web and mobile apps with maximum code reuse."
