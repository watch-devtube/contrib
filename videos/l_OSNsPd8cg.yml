description: "Speaker: Marten Deinum\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/mdeinum/improving-legacy-applications-with-spring\nSource Code:  https://github.com/mdeinum/legacy-app\nSpring has been around since the release of “J2EE Design and Development” in 2002. Spring and Java have evolved quite a bit since that time. In those years a lot of applications have been developed. All those \"legacy\" applications that are around have proven their value and that is why they lasted.\n\nIn this session we will explore how we can improve our legacy applications by doing some refactoring or redesign (component based development) but also by introducing (newer) Spring IO technologies."
