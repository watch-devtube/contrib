Why do we have so many? Which way should you be using? What does it mean when you use the wrong one? \n\nA function declaration is like the thesis statement in an essay. It should communicate both for the caller and the callee it's purpose, semantics, and side-effects. We often think this communication is in the form of comments, but a function's arguments also convey this information. \n\nThis talk will catalog many the different ways to pass arguments. We will then explore which ones are redundant or nonsensical, and give meaning to the ones that remain. We will end with recommendations what types to use to express your intent, and empower you with fundamentals to write clearer function definitions. \n— \nRichard Powell, Audio Software Engineer\n\nI started using C++ 10 years ago to write a psychoacoustic audio encoder/decoder and have continued to explore how to make software that unlocks the potential of hardware to bring amazing applications to life. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a BS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and worked throughout the Bay Area for the past 15 years. I enjoy teaching and learning about C++ and programming.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
