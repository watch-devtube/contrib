language: English
recordingDate: 1513954218
description: "This talk tells a true story with a thin disguise. (The company involved does not want some details known.) Two years ago, a team I work with developed an application that addressed a strategically important pain-point. This is the story of how we used the Strategic Design tools of DDD to decide what to do, and how we ultimately turned it into a simple problem by leveraging established formalisms to do something quite original.\n\nEric Evans is a thought leader in software design and domain modeling and the author of “Domain-Driven Design”.\n\nEric now leads Domain Language, a consulting group which coaches and trains teams applying domain-driven design, helping them to make their development work more productive and more valuable to their business.\n\nFor more on YOW!
