This week on The Developer Show, we learned how to get started with Android and Android Studio (with the help of some zombies), got details on all the new Udacity courses, had a heaping serving of Big Android BBQ, discussed the awesomeness of the new Fingerprint API sample, and much more. Join Timothy Jordan, his Hat, and his panel of experts (Katherine Kuan, Ian Lake, Paul Bakaus) to talk all things Google Dev.\n\nLinks:\n\nFingerprint API: http://goo.gl/RcYZ9Q \n\nThe Play Games Services Toolset for Android: http://goo.gl/BGie1f \n\nGet started with Android and Android studio (and Zombies): https://goo.gl/6pqzWL  \n\nThe Big Android BBQ: https://goo.gl/6pmuca \n\nBrillo and Weave Invitation Program: https://goo.gl/11w7wp  \n\nAndroid Developer Immersive Training Course: https://goo.gl/Nvvxua \n\nNew Udacity Courses: \n(Android Wear Development) https://goo.gl/pe45mn\n(Android TV and Google Cast Development) https://goo.gl/DfaOFS \n(Android Auto Development) https://goo.gl/C0GQLd \n\nTech Entrepreneur Nanodegree - Udacity: https://goo.gl/hfjq5i \n\nAccelerated Mobile Pages Project: https://goo.gl/Ooi6qS \nhttps://goo.gl/1gUaDB\nhttp://goo.gl/XP0nfx\n\nSF HTML 5 Meetup Videos: https://goo.gl/bc9Xpp  \n\nChrome Dev Summit 2015: https://goo.gl/eDz1Z3"
