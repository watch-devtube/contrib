description: "http://velocityconf.com\nThe days of complete control are over. Today, the website is your organization's most important online asset and it is more exposed than ever before. Customers are measuring you, competitors are benchmarking you, and things outside of your control are robbing your site of performance. Cloud computing, malfunctioning Java assets, self-centric third-party application providers, and undetected hungry gremlins put your site's performance up for the taking every moment, every day.\n\nNeustar Web Performance Management services offer comprehensive monitoring and load testing that helps you find and fix performance problems -- fast. Powered by a unified Selenium platform and packed with a rules-based intelligent alerting engine, Neustar Web Performance not only finds problems, but can automatically invoke contingency actions that you set up. Join us for this discussion to learn how you can begin to stop website performance theft TODAY.\n\nhttp://velocityconf.com/velocity2013/public/schedule/speaker/156155"
