description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeakers: Matthew Adams (SCI Spike), Michael Nitschinger (Couchbase)\nData / Integration Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/cassandra-couchbase-andspringdataintheenterprise \nSpring Data Cassandra brings Cassandra support to the Spring Data umbrella of projects, offering Spring Data's familiar Repository concepts & POJO persistence. This talk will focus first on POJO persistence over Cassandra, including automatic Cassandra schema generation and Spring context configuration using both XML & Java. Then, the talk will dig deeper into some of the lower-level features that Spring Data Cassandra is built upon (AKA \"Spring CQL\"), which make plain, old Cassandra development simpler & easier.\n\nCouchbase Server is well-known as one of the leaders in the NoSQL space, heavily used in enterprises and startups alike where low latency even at hundreds of thousands of operations per seconds matters. This talk will not only give a short introduction about the benefits of adopting Couchbase, but also show how to integrate it into your Java Enterprise landscape through its support for Spring Data. You will learn how to fully control your database schema from the application through entities and repositories, how to deploy new application versions or scale out your cluster without a single second of downtime and also how to integrate easily with elasticsearch."
