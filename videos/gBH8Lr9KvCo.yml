description: "Slides: http://sdrv.ms/GMM5bw\nIt's funny the way dog owners look like their pets, but how much do we resemble our language? In my art project, poetry.js, I use the execution and semantics of JavaScript to explore different aspects of humanity, and from those explorations, I hope to show you that underneath, despite our share of bad parts, there's a very elegant core to people. We have insecurities and overconfidence - common problems to avoid - but I'll discuss strategies for resolving them. All this through a series of executing poems. You'll hoist. You'll loop forever. And hopefully, you'll come away with a better understanding of our need for community.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/joel-dart-people-the-good-parts.html\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
