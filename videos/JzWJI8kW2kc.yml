description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2018\nhttps://dddeurope.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nEvent Sourcing after launch: how to evolve your event store along with your application\n\nEvent sourcing can be a solution for certain problems in your application, but it also comes with its own set of challenges. One of those is the evolution of your event schema. How should you handle changes to events?\n\nWe found many approaches while doing our research (we’ve published earlier results in our paper “The Dark Side of Event Sourcing”) and we gained a lot of experienced from building a full-size ERP application using CQRS and event sourcing. In this talk we will show what kind of approaches we’ve found and what we use to deal with our specific challenges. We will also share early research results from our interviews with over 20 different companies using event sourcing.\n\nEvery request for advice can be answered with ‘it depends’, and this talk will not solve that. But we will tell you what your options are, what we think works, and what many others have done.\n\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nMichiel writes code (mostly C#) at AFAS, where he is part of the team that is responsible for the future ERP cloud platform. His business card says \"talk is cheap, show me the code\", but he also writes research papers as a PhD candidate in the Amuse Project."
