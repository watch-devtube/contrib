description: 'cgi-lib.pl, CGI.pm, mod_perl, and Mojolicious: all in the same codebase?!?! It’s not uncommon for developers in Perl shops to be dealing with older code, so how do you do it? This session will discuss strategies, ideas, and the pain (both technical and organizational) associated with dragging 15+ year old code into the Modern Age while also continuing to build new things–and do it with a famously small staff. This talk will consider factors beyond the code, such as the changing landscapes in infrastructure, testing, deployment, logging, APIs, monitoring, and more.'
