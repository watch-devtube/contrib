description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2017 #flinkforward\n\nAndreas Kunst, PhD Student / Research Associate at Technische Universität Berlin\n\nWhile dataflow engines offer scalability, their programming abstractions are often unfamiliar to data scientists, which are used to Python and R. To provide a more convenient interface, dataflow engines like Spark provide an R-like dataframe abstraction. While operations without user-defined code can be executed efficiently, the execution of UDFs is dominated by serialized data exchange between the dataflow engine and an external R process that evaluates the code. We present a new approach to execute user-defined functions by using the Truffle/Graal compiler infrastructure, which enables efficient execution of dynamic languages on the JVM. Based on fastR, the R language provided by this infrastructure, we exemplify the execution of R scripts directly inside the data pipelines of Flink, without data serialization and inter-process communication. Furthermore, we discuss future opportunities and problems, and compare our approach to native Flink, Spark, and SparkR.\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/FlinkForward/flink-forward-berlin-2017-andreas-kunft-efficiently-executing-r-dataframes-on-flink\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
