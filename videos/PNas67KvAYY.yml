title: 'Email, XMPP, and Task Queues in Google AppEngine: an O''Reilly Breakdown Preview'
recordingDate: 1297699250
description: 'Google App Engine is more than a simple platform for application hosting and data storage. Google also provides a suite of services, ranging from messaging to advance task management and queuing. Because many applications hosted locally don''t have robust services, most programmers aren''t familiar with delayed tasking and message architectures. In this O''Reilly Breakdown, Dan Pilone introduces how all of these services work in Google App Engine.'
