title: 'CON2111   Writing a 3-D Multiplayer Game with Kawa and JMonkeyEngine'

description: "Developing a modern network game is very expensive. Performance is important, so people don’t normally think of using Java, let alone a more dynamic language. Fabric is a game that was developed by one person with JMonkeyEngine and the Kawa language. It is an immersive 3-D multiplayer role-playing game with distinctive features. JMonkeyEngine is a pure Java scene-graph-based game engine. Kawa is a mature Scheme-based language with good Java integration and high performance. All Fabric-specific code is in Kawa. This session demonstrates unique Fabric features made possible by Kawa and JMonkeyEngine and touches on Kawa’s advantages and limitations compared to alternatives, especially Clojure and ABCL.\n\nSpeaker:\nPer Bothner, Consultant, self\nPer Bothner founded the Kawa project in 1996. Kawa is the oldest known still-active compiled implementation of a dynamic language (Scheme) on the JVM. Also in 1996 Per started the GCJ project, an ahead-of-time open-source implementation of the Java langauge based on GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). Both of these projects were started while working for Cygnus Solution, an open-source pioneer later acquired by Red Hat. In 2007 Per was hired by Sun for the JavaFX Script language and compiler project; he continued working for Oracle until 2014. Other projects he initiated include the stdio implementation used in GNU/Linux; eterm, the Emacs Terminal Emulator; cpplib, the C Pre-Processor library used by GCC; and DomTerm, a JavaScript-based terminal emulator and console. mikel evins conceived, designed and implemented the Fabric, an immersive multiplayer network game set in a science-fiction world. mikel worked as a technical writer and software developer for Apple, Inc. for a decade, contributing to diverse projects and products, including the Newton OS, QuickTime, HyperCard, AppleScript, and the SK8 advanced authoring system. He worked at NeXT on the Digital Librarian suite of applications and supporting NeXT’s BSD commands and libraries. He joined Reactivity, Inc. in the late 1990s, where he help to found and launch several successful startup companies and contributed to Reactivity’s development of a network security appliance that led to its acquisition by Cisco Systems in the early twenty-first century. mikel is a lifelong Lisp enthusiast."
