recordingDate: 1538633235
description: "Liberty Mutual Technology Group has undertaken an agile transformation powered in part by our migration to cloud-based infrastructure. The resulting mix of legacy, on-premises, and public cloud applications introduces a host of challenges to the modern enterprise. We can't predict the future but one thing is certain - Hybrid Cloud is the new normal. Significant investment, development discipline, and cultural shift are required to ensure that the same high level of security is maintained without compromising the software delivery acceleration and agility that we desire. We're solving these challenges through a combination of tools and techniques geared towards enabling automation and self-service amongst our delivery teams. The end goal: empower our developers to rapidly deliver customer value via highly-secure pipelines to the cloud.\n\nSeptember 26, 2018\n5:00 pm - 5:30 pm\nNational Harbor 10-11\n\nSpeakers:\nMatt Ruel\nSecurity Architect, Liberty Mutual\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
