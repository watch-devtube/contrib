description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2017 #flinkforward\n\nSteffen Hausmann,  Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services \n\nThe increasing number of available data sources in today's application stacks created a demand to continuously capture and process data from various sources to quickly turn high volume streams of raw data into actionable insights. Apache Flink addresses many of the challenges faced in this domain as it's specifically tailored to distributed computations over streams. While Flink provides all the necessary capabilities to process streaming data, provisioning and maintaining a Flink cluster still requires considerable effort and expertise. We will discuss how cloud services can remove most of the burden of running the clusters underlying your Flink jobs and explain how to build a real-time processing pipeline on top of AWS by integrating Flink with Amazon Kinesis and Amazon EMR. We will furthermore illustrate how to leverage the reliable, scalable, and elastic nature of the AWS cloud to effectively create and operate your real-time processing pipeline with little operational overhead.\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/FlinkForward/flink-forward-berlin-2017-steffen-hausmann-build-a-realtime-stream-processing-pipeline-with-apache-flink-on-aws\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
