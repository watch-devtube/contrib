description: "Yes, we're going to look at file parsing. Sounds a bit boring, right? Wrong.\n\nIn this talk, just for fun, we'll find out how to parse a file. We'll look at simple, hand crafted parsers. We'll finally figure out just how lex and yacc work. And we'll pick apart structured parsers that build abstract syntax trees as you type - ReSharper style. How is an IDEs parser different to a compilers? How do you handle sensible error recovery? What about significant whitespace?\n\nEverything you always wanted to know about parsing a file, but were too afraid to ask."
