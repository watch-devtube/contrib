recordingDate: 1404955799
description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA.\nSpeakers: Gunnar Hillert, Michael Minella\nThis talk is for everyone who wants to efficiently use Spring Batch and Spring Integration together. Users of Spring Batch often have the requirements to interact with other systems, to schedule the periodic execution Batch jobs and to monitor the execution of Batch jobs. Conversely, Spring Integration users periodically have Big Data processing requirements, be it for example the handling of large traditional batch files or the execution of Apache Hadoop jobs. For these scenarios, Spring Batch is the ideal solution. This session will introduce Spring Batch Integration, a project that provides support to easily tie Spring Batch and Spring Integration together. We will cover the following scenarios:\n\n    Launch Batch Jobs through Spring Integration Messages\n    Generate Informational Messages\n    Externalize Batch Process Execution using Spring Integration\n    Create Big Data Pipelines with Spring Batch and Spring Integration\n\nLearn more about Spring Batch: http://projects.spring.io/spring-batch/\nLearn more about Spring Integration: http://projects.spring.io/spring-integration/"
