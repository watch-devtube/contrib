description: "This video was recorded at the Erlang Factory Munich in 2012. For more info and slides of the speaker, go to:  https://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/Munich2013/speakers/PeerStritzinger\n\nRTEMS is a open-source hard-realtime operating system for small embedded systems.  It is used in the aerospace industry flying on satellites and planetary probes - currently its also driving around on Mars.  This talk shows how Erlang and RTEMS work together in real world products.  In the first product they are running on separate boards talking over USB, in the second product Erlang even runs atop of RTEMS as operating system.\n\nTalk objectives: Show some real world examples of how Erlang can be used to build better industrial embedded systems.\n\nTarget audience: Erlang developers and embedded developers interested in Erlang."
