description: "Automating schema migration flow with GitHub Actions, skeema & gh-ost And end-to-end schema migration automation, from design to production, at GitHub\nby Shlomi Noach\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2214/mysql_github_schema.webm\n\nSchema migration is more than running an ALTER TABLE. It is about designing, reviewing, approving, queuing, scheduling, executing, auditing, controlling and versioning the changes.\n\n\nAt GitHub we run multiple migrations per day, and much of this flow used to be manual, taking a significant toll from the databases team. In this session we illustrate how we automated away migration using free and open source solutions, and based on trusted development flow.\nSchema migration is more than running an ALTER TABLE.
