title: 'React - Say "No" to Complexity'

description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nReact - Say \"No\" to Complexity\n\nReact is a web framework from Facebook that focuses on the view portion. It emphasizes building UIs from components, most of which only use data that is directly passed to them. This results in components that are easy to understand, reuse, and test. React applications naturally divide into code that addresses two concerns. The first is what a component should render when given certain data. The second is how events should modify the state of the application. React handles determining the minimum set of DOM changes that are required to update the UI based on changes to the state. This is done efficiently through use of a \"virtual DOM\". Changes to this can be quickly \"diffed\" against the previous version. This talk covers everything you need to know to get started using React.\n\nMark Volkmann, Object Computing, Inc.\n\nMark Volkmann is a partner at Object Computing, Inc.
