title: 'Challenges in Causality'

description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary, 11 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWhat affects your health, the economy, climate changes? And what actions will\nhave beneficial effects? These are some of the central questions of causal\ndiscovery. A \"causal model\" is a model capable of making predictions under\nchanging circumstances, corresponding to actions of \"external agents\" on a\nsystem of interest. For example, a doctor administering a drug to a patient, a\ngovernment enforcing a new tax law or a new environmental policy. It is often\nnecessary to assess the benefits and risks of potential actions using available\npast data and excluding the possibility of experimenting. Experiments, which\nare the ultimate way of verifying causal relationships, are in many cases too\ncostly, infeasible, or unethical. For instance, enforcing a law prohibiting to\nsmoke in public places is costly, preventing people from smoking may be\ninfeasible, and forcing them to smoke would be unethical. In contrast,\n\"observational data\" are available in abundance in many applications. Recently,\nmethods to devise causal models from observational data have been proposed. Can\ncausal models thus obtained be relied upon to make important decisions? In this\npresentation, we will challenge the hopes an promises of causal discovery and\npresent new means of assessing the validity of causal modeling techniques.\n\n\nWant to play?
