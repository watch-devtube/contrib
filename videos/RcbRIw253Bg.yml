description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nApril 13, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Ilana Preuss.\r\n\r\nThis year, a new transportation bill will be working its way through Congress, and now is the time to talk about bold new ideas for a 21st century transportation system.  The Transportation for America Campaign, a national coalition to drastically reform the transportation bill, is bringing people together across the country to hear about the projects and visions for change that people have.  How we will move people and goods more cheaply and protect our environment?  What do we need in a national transportation system to compete in the global market?  What do we need to get from our homes to our jobs or to school?  How do we build a transportation system that helps us reach our climate change goals? \r\n\r\nJoin the Google Town Hall Meeting on Transportation to learn about the Transportation for America Campaign, talk about critical transportation needs for the region, and discuss how we can get there. Congress is talking about $500 billion for transportation - what do you want to spend it on?\r\n\r\nIlana Preuss is the Outreach and Field Director for the Transportation for America Campaign.
