title: 'D3 js: Easy and flexible data visualisation using Web standards Jos Dirksen'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510303699
description: "D3 has been around for a couple of years. This last year the new v4 version of D3 has been released with a modular API and many new features that make D3 even easier to use. With D3 it is very easy to create beautiful, interactive and flexible data visualisation using web standards which can be viewed on any device.\n\nWhen you first look at the D3 APIs it might be a bit daunting. D3 provides many different features, functions and visualisations which you can use, but the amount of information can make it difficult to get started. The good thing is, though, that by learning a couple of concepts (a couple of patterns) on how D3 works, understanding all these libraries and parts of D3 becomes easy and immediately clear.\n\nIn this presentation I'll walk through the most important concepts of D3 and show, by explaining a couple of basic concepts, how you can create the most beautiful data visualisations with a minimal amount of coding. Besides the core D3 concepts I'll show the most interesting parts of the D3 API in the presentation like: animations, out-of-the-box diagrams, geo/gis, force-diagrams and how to make art with D3.\n\n# Jos Dirksen\nFullstack develop, love everything from cloud infrastructure, CI/CD automation to Java / Scala / golang development and frontend data visualisation (2D with D3.js and 3D with three.js).\n\nBeen doing this for the last 15 years in many different roles, in many different companies. Besides that I also love writing and talking about technology. I've written four books on Three.js development, one on D3.js data visualisation and a couple on backend technologies such as Scala webservices, ESBs and governance.\n\nCurrently working as Scala engineer for Philips Lighting where I do a lot of very interesting things with cloud, AWS, microservices and IOT."
