title: 'Wicked Problems & Design - James Haliburton'
recordingDate: 1550662662
description: "The 4th industrial revolution is surfacing more and more Wicked Problems... and this is a challenge for designers.\n\nWicked problems are problems that are seemingly impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize. Embracing complexity and experimentation is the next frontier for designers, but involves transforming our way of working. \nJames will take a brief look at the evolution of the design practices & mediums leading up to present day.  And we’ll talk about making complex technologies tangible, particularly for connected systems, AIs, distributed experiences, and other more wicked challenges like innovation of taxes and refugee crises.\n\nJames Haliburton co-founded Topp in 2013, a growing team based out of Malmö, Stockholm, and San Francisco. He’s currently the Managing Partner of the Topp Group, of which Topp Design & Innovation and Noodl, the platform for design experimentation, are part of. \nFrom Doctors Without Borders to Samsung to Nike, the group is working with international, large scale initiatives to make impact with design, prototyping, and business experimentation.\n\nJames spent the past 15 years leading design and innovation organizations, is a frequent international speaker and teacher in the field of emerging design practices, and has a special interest in developing multidisciplinary teams to solve transformative problems.\n_____________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \n\nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \n\nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
