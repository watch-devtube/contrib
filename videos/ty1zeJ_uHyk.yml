description: "Panel: Powering Hyper-Growth in e-Mobility With Cloud Foundry - Kerstin Daher, Pivotal, Janardhan Vittal, Wipro, Jurgen Bluemink, Stefan Trager, & Vít?zslav Burda, innogy SE\n\nExplosive growth of charging stations in Germany is expected in upcoming years. Building IT solutions to support this demand requires seamless scalability for applications across cloud infrastructure. The problem? A monolithic codebase that had reached its scaling limits. How is innogy modernizing to a microservices-based architecture, running on infrastructure that enables organization scalability?\n\nCome to this session to hear lessons learned: How we started with new application design; how developers coming from DIY world overcame their scepticism of the automated application platform; how we started our journey with Pivotal Cloud Foundry; how we set up the operational model with already outsourced IT services to a big system integrator; what unexpected difficulties we have faced and how together we found the way forward and plan our bright future.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRzB/panel-powering-hyper-growth-in-e-mobility-with-cloud-foundry-kerstin-daher-pivotal-janardhan-vittal-wipro-jurgen-bluemink-stefan-trager-vitezslav-burda-innogy-se"
