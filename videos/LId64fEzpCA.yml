description: "The forecast of 50 billion connected devices by 2020 will create even greater data volume than today’s internet, resulting in the Internet of Things. Trying to integrate a diverse class of client devices (Things) with enterprise systems will be a daunting technology task. An effective approach to this challenge is to utilize Java as a universal device-to-data-center (D2D) abstraction layer running across the spectrum of devices, gateways, and enterprise systems. This solution provides the ability to cost-effectively deploy secure, agile, and scalable systems. This session is an analysis of key components and system requirements (security, identity, device management, analytics, and so on) for applying this Java D2D abstraction approach.\n\n\nAuthors:\nPaul Pishal\nPaul Pishal is the Vice President of Business Development for M2M Solutions at Hitachi Communication Technologies America responsible for penetrating new markets, establishing partnerships and achieving revenue targets for the M2M market.
