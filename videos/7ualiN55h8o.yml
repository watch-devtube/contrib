description: "Andrea Magnorsky\nDeveloper and co-founder (BatCat Games)\n\nAndrea is a developer that makes games, at the moment Onikira:Demon Killer. She likes to learn how to do things in different ways, in the hope that one day she will have to do nothing and just do things because she can. Conferences and meetups are a great way to learn more, so Andrea tries to help when she can to make them happen :)Andrea worked on enterprise (not the one with Piccard sadly) for too many years and then created the company where she and her team now make games, the future unknown.\n\nThe Tools that Shape Us\n\nMaking great games is all about fast iteration. Giving the designers and content creators the ability to quickly test an idea and then grow that idea organically is critical to finding the fun. That means that we as developers need to make tools that make their workflows as painless and transparent as possible.\n\nOver the last year, we have been using F# in our game and this talk is a short reflection on how that has turned out.\n\nWe'll talk about: the language, the ecosystem, the tooling and the community with live examples from the game and the tool chain"
