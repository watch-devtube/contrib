title: 'Google I/O 2011: 3D Graphics on Android: Lessons learned from Google Body'
language: English
recordingDate: 1305330557
description: "Nico Weber\r\n\r\nGoogle originally built Google Body, a 3D application that renders the human body in incredible detail, for WebGL-capable browsers running on high-end bPCs. To bring the app to Android at a high resolution and frame rate, Nico Weber and Won Chun had a close encounter with Android's graphics stack. In this session Nico will present their findings as best practices for high-end 3D graphics using OpenGL ES 2.0 on Android. The covered topics range from getting accelerated pixels on the screen to fast resource loading, performance guidelines, texture compression, mipmapping, recommended vertex attribute formats, and shader handling. The talk also touches on related topics such as SDK vs NDK, picking, and resource loading."
