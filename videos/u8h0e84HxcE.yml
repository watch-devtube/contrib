description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nKubernetes On Cgroup v2 - Giuseppe Scrivano, Red Hat \n\nThis talk will go over the current status of cgroups v2 in the Kubernetes and container ecosystem.  Efforts are underway to enable cgroups v2 in containers runtimes and up the stack in Kubernetes so users can benefit from new kernel features such as PSI and have better OOM handling through using projects such as oomd.  Particular focus will be placed on the changes required in the OCI (Open Container Initiative) specifications and how the containers runtime must be adapted to use the new version.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeoS"
