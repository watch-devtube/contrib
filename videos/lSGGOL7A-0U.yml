description: "In this session attendees will learn the of TensorFlow by an interactive discussion of basic elements of the framework and how they can be composed to create deep learning machine learning models.\nAttendees should come away with a strong foundation of how to both create deep learning models as well as how to consume them in their applications. A basic understanding of the concepts of deep learning are helpful but not needed. Prior exposure to TensorFlow is definitely not expected.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
