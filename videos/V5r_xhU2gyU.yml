title: 'Empowering Docker with Linked Data Principles'
language: English
recordingDate: 1509732387
description: 'Docker Containers are eating the world. Industry and academia are both exploiting Docker to orchestrate complex cloud infrastructure and to foster reproducibility of computational experiments. Linked Data capture the original idea of a connected yet decentralized Web. Online resources are accessible through a URI; ontologies and vocabularies like Schema.org foster interoperability and data integration. I advocate the value of applying the Linked Data paradigm to the Docker ecosystem. Dereferencing access to them and making image registries accessible by the means of graph query languages, e.g. SPARQL or GraphQL. To this extent, it is necessary to semantically describe Dockerfiles, images, and containers. and to adopt a data model like RDF.'
