title: 'Polyworld: Using Evolution to Design Artificial Intelligence'
recordingDate: 1194951939
description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nNovember,  8 2007\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis presentation is about a potential shortcut to artificial intelligence by trading mind-design for world-design using artificial evolution. Evolutionary algorithms are a pump for turning CPU cycles into brain designs. With exponentially increasing CPU cycles while our understanding of intelligence is almost a flat-line, the evolutionary route to AI is a centerpiece of most Kurzweilian singularity scenarios. This talk introduces the Polyworld artificial life simulator as well as results from our ongoing attempt to evolve artificial intelligence and further the Singularity.\r\n\r\nPolyworld is the brain child of Apple Computer Distinguished Scientist Larry Yaeger, who remains the primary developer of Polyworld:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.beanblossom.in.us/larryy/Polyworld.html\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Virgil Griffith\r\nVirgil Griffith is a first year graduate student in Computation and Neural Systems at the California Institute of Technology.  On weekdays he studies evolution, computational neuroscience, and artificial life.  He did computer security work until his first year of university when his work got him sued for sedition and espionage. He then decided that security was probably not safest field to be in and he turned his life to science."
