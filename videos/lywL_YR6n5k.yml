description: "TestCon Vilnius 2016. Software Testing & QA Conference. \nOctober 21, 2016 | www.testcon.lt\n\nAppium has grown from humble beginnings to become the defacto standard for mobile application user interface automation. From the time of its creation in 2011 until now, the project faced many challenges and big decisions, the responses to which would ultimately determine whether or not the project would succeed. This talk will discuss the lessons learned from these crucial points in the growth of the project with the intent of imparting to the audience a better understanding of how open software functions and how they might better create, consume, and contribute to open source software."
