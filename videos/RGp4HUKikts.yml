description: "Although security is a crucial aspect for any application, its implementation can be difficult. Worse, it is often neglected, poorly implemented and intrusive in the code. But lately, security servers has appeared which allow to outsource and delegate all authentication and authorization aspects, such as https://auth0.com/. Of these servers, one of the most promising is KeyCloak, open-source, flexible and agnostic of any technology, it is easily deployable / adaptable in its own infrastructure. In this session, I propose you to discover KeyCloak progressivly and in an interactive way: 0 slide, 100% live coding. From securing an \"old school\" Java EE app, a Node.js Microservice to a standalone Angular Web App Angular or even a mobile app, all aspects of KeyCloak will be demonstrated. This will also include how to integrate social login, enable Single Sign On or how to bridge to existing identity providers (LDAP, ActiveDirectory).\n\nSébastien Blanc is JEE engineer with 10 years of experience. He works at Red Hat and focus on Open Source libraries for Mobile in the Enterprise Besides his “heavy” JEE profile (middleware, banking and insurance products) Sébastien spends a lot of time in Groovy and Grails. He is the author of several Grails plugins such as Spring Mobile, Jquery Mobile Scaffolding or Geolocation. He believes that Mobile Web/Hybrid Apps are the future and tries to evangelize this through different conferences (Devoxx, JUDCon, JavaOne, SpringOne).\n\n[PTE-7793]"
