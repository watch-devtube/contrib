description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nLearn new ways to think about class design, that you can apply to your own projects! \n\nIn this talk we'll start with a simple class that models an HTTP message. We’ll go over the limitations of the simple declaration, then walk through a series of guided improvements. We will explore ways to think about class models, create a concept as a customization point, perform type checking, and document a concept. \n\nThe example class we will explore is based on the message container found in the Boost.Beast library. You do not need to know anything (or care) about network protocols. This is about building better classes.\n— \nVinnie Falco: Engineer, Self-Directed\n\nI'm the author of BearShare, DSPFilters, and most importantly Boost.Beast - a C++ header only library that offers implementations for HTTP and WebSockets, located here: https://github.com/boostorg/beast/\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
