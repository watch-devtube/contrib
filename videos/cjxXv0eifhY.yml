description: "You've been bitten by the testing bug, are thoroughly test infected. Excellent! You're undoubtedly producing more robust, less buggy software faster and at lower cost. Sadly, it wasn't always this way. You're saddled with a large legacy of untested code. Test first development is not an option. Nonetheless unit testing, JUnit, and test driven development can still dramatically improve your maintenance tasks. Learn strategies for retrofitting test frameworks onto existing code, and developing a test suite for code that never had one before.\n\n Elliotte Rusty Harold\nWhen not laboring in his secret identity of a mild-mannered software developer, Elliotte Rusty Harold lives in a secret mountaintop laboratory on a large island off the East Coast of the United States with his wife Beth and dog Thor. His open source work includes the XOM library for processing XML with Java, the Amateur Media Player, and Google Cloud Tools for Eclipse. His most recent books are Java Network Programming, 4th edition, and JavaMail API, both from O’Reilly.\n\n[RMS-3799]"
