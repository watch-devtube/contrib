title: '"Implementing Diverse and Inclusive Codes of Conduct" - Matthew Cengia (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612055149
description: "Matthew Cengia\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/69/\n\nSo you've started a new community. This could be anything from a new open source project you've started to develop, or a meetup group you're trying to form for people in your local area who are interested in the same sort of things as you. You want others to participate in this community; humans are social creatures, after all. In order for this to be a safe and inclusive community, though, you'll need to have some guidelines on how people should interact, what behaviours are acceptable, and how disputes and conflicts are resolved. The start of this process should be a code of conduct, paired with an incident response procedure. This talk will explain how critically important these things are to maintaining your community, and how to go about implementing them.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nSun Jan 24 15:45:00 2021 at Tux Theatre"
