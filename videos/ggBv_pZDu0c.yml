title: 'Documentation as code (explained to my dad) by Hubert Sablonnie?re'

description: "As coders, we use powerful tools everyday (IDE, versioning, build, intgration, deployment). We also put a lot of effort on software quality with a set of best practices (tests, SoC, DRY, KISS...). Despite that, when it comes to documentation, we're still using traditional desktop tools and wikis.\n\nBy using a lightweight markup language like AsciiDoc, we'll see how we can reuse our favourite coders' tools and practices to improve our documentation trough the whole cycle : writing, collaborating and publishing.\n\n Hubert Sablonnière\nI'm a curious and passionnate Web developer. I'm specialized in HTML, CSS and JavaScript but I also use server side technologies like NodeJS, PHP, Java, Neo4j, Docker...\n\nMy motivation : \"To push the technology far enough to find new ways to improve user's experiences.\""
