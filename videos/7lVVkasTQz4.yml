description: 'If you’re reading this summary on a computer, chances are there is a QWERTY keyboard on your desk. This keyboard layout has been around since 1873, and it has been widely adopted ever since. However, its popularity has always remained a mystery to me. Why is everyone using a keyboard layout that doesn’t look that efficient on first sight? I’m not the only one asking this question. A lot of myths exist on the QWERTY keyboard layout, including the one that it was specifically designed to slow down typists. In preparation for a switch to the DVORAK layout, I did some research and found out that a lot of these myths are riddled with factual errors. Also, I started learning DVORAK and kept track of my progress and what I thought were the pros and cons. So was QWERTY designed to slow us down? Is it feasible to adopt an alternative layout like DVORAK? If so, how long will it take you to learn it, and should everyone consider it? Join this session to have your questions answered, and feel free to bring your keyboard layout of choice. :-)'
