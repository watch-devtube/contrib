title: 'DEF CON 26 - Josh Mitchell - Ridealong Adventures: Critical Issues with Police Body Cameras'
language: English
recordingDate: 1536958092
description: "The police body camera market has been growing in popularity over the last few years. A recent (2016) Johns Hopkins University market survey found 60 different models have been produced specifically for law enforcement use. Rapid adoption is fueling this meteoric increase in availability and utilization. Additionally, device manufactures are attempting to package more and more technology into these devices. This has caused a deficiency in local municipalities' skills and budget to accurately assess the attack surface and exposure to the organization. Furthermore, departmental policies and procedures governing the secure deployment of these devices is largely insufficient. \n\nAt DEF CON, we will be introducing tactics, techniques, and procedures to assess the security of these devices. We will cover attacks against the physical devices, RF components, smartphone app's, and desktop software. The capabilities demonstrated and discussed will encompass publicly and privately available technologies. Additionally, the talk will cover multiple products and vendors, shedding light on industry wide issues and trends. Finally, we will be releasing software to detect and track various devices and tie these issues into real world events."
