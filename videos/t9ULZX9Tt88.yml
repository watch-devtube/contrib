description: 'How do you make users click and come back?  Learn how to nurture user interest, the fuel of web browsing.  Increase their reserves by giving them interesting concepts, designs, and data.  Maintain interest by minimizing user confusion and input.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, the same optimizations can be applied to the development team on the project.'
