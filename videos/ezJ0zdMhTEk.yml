description: "Deep Dive: Telepresence - Adnan Abdulhussein, Bitnami & Rafael Schloming, Datawire \n\nOne of the challenges facing Telepresence is growing the contributor community. It’s a complex application that requires a good understanding of OS networking, VPNs, Kubernetes, and everything in between. We’ll kick off this meeting with a general architectural overview of Telepresence. We’ll talk about how we’ve managed the project to date, and our investments to make it easier. We want to then turn it over for an interactive discussion with participants to see what we can do to make it easier to contribute and grow the Telepresence community. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrdI"
