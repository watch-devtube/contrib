description: "Building Umbrella Project by Wojtek Mach\n\nOne of the many goals that both Elixir & Phoenix share is developer’s productivity. There can be two aspects of productivity: short-term and long-term.\nIn this talk we’ll explore how using Elixir’s umbrella project feature can help with long-term productivity when working with potentially large codebases. As a example we’ll walk through building an imaginary system: Acme Bank. We will see how we can break up this system into a collection of smaller applications, each of which has a well defined boundary, domain model, set of responsibilities, and can be worked on independently. We’ll compare this approach to microservices-based architecture which is being adopted by many organizations and we’ll see if we can achieve some of the benefits without incurring some of the drawbacks."
