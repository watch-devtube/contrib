recordingDate: 1582271100
description: "China is opening up to communicate to the rest of the world it's chinese culture in hopes that greater understanding can be formed between its 5,000 year history, and it's new found identity. Anina has the pleasure to be the first foreigner to work directly with the CHIC Fashion Expo to educate the fashion industry on how to use mobile technology in their retail business and brand building. What has been possible for her to achieve successfully in China was due to the ability to embrace a 360 degree point of view.\n\nSummit of Newthinking, 15. bis 16.
