description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeaker: Andreas Evers, Ordina JWorks\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/writing-comprehensive-and-guaranteed-uptodate-rest-api-documentation\n\nRESTful APIs are eating the world, yet all too often the documentation can cause indigestion for the APIs' developers and their users. Developers have to deal with annotation overload, repetition, and an unpleasant writing environment. Users are then left with documentation that's inaccurate and difficult to use. It doesn't have to be this way.\n\nThis talk will introduce Spring REST Docs and its test-driven approach to RESTful API documentation. We'll look at how it combines the power of Asciidoctor and your integration tests to produce documentation that's accurate and easy-to-read, while keeping your code DRY and free from annotation overload. We'll also look at some of the features that are new in Spring REST Docs 1.1, including support for REST Assured and Markdown."
