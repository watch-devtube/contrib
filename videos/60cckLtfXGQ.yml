description: "Java has a security model targeted at running applets and untrusted code, so you don’t need to worry about running your own code on your own servers, right?  In fact, there are several vulnerability patterns that can affect server-side Java applications, and this presentation outlines some of the steps you should take to ensure that your server room is not compromised. It looks at the established techniques for enhancing your security and shows new technology from IBM that addresses several attack vectors.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTim Ellison\nTim Ellison is a senior technical staff member in the Java Technology Centre at IBM Hursley Park.
