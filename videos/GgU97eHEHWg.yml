title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Talk to me Drupal! Powering an Alexa App with Drupal.'
recordingDate: 1523515515
description: "More and more I find myself talking to a computer. For simple tasks, the voice is increasingly becoming the first place to attempt an interaction. It is far easier to shout at my Amazon Echo/Google Home, \"Hey you! What is the average air speed of an unladen swallow?\" than to pull out my phone and find the wikipedia article on the subject and scan for the desired information.\n\nThis is a two fold presentation. I will, very briefly, go over VUI (Voice User Interface) design focusing on\_the two major vendors: Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa. Then I will show you\_an app architecture that ties an Alexa app together with Drupal Managed Content. I will be showing some code, but it will be basic. It is by no means a requirement to be a programmer to attend this talk.\n\nHey Alexa, ask Drupal for a bunch of content!\n\nWho should Attend?\n\nAnyone interested in building a voice powered app\nAnyone interested in new interesting technologies\nDrupal! It's not just for HTML anymore."
