description: 'Functional programming is a trending topic, especially in web development. People often try to explain its essence with too theoretical concepts (monads) or too superficial points of view (it''s just lambda functions). I will help you understand and feel what it really is and why it matters in the real world. We will see fundamental functional programming concepts, and apply them with JavaScript to get better code. Writing good code means spending less time to fix bugs or add features!'
