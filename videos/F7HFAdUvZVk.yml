title: 'Build, Deploy, Debug and Tune Serverless Microservices by Randall Hunt'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510225710
description: "Traditional development and debugging methods don’t work as well for serverless environments and microservice-based applications. Multiple independent components built using different languages and running on different environments are a real-life story. In this talk we’ll build, deploy, and debug (in that order) a serverless microservice-based application. An end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application will be shown. The attendees will learn how to easily construct an intelligent continuous integration and deployment pipeline. We will encourage the audience to participate in breaking and fixing our application. Attendees will learn how to troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors.\n\n# Randall Hunt\nTechnical Evangelist and Software Engineer at @aws and @awslabs. Formerly of SpaceX, NASA, and @mongodb"
