description: "Working from distance comes with its own set of challenges. Remote teams need to combat the \"out of sight, out of mind\" mentality and learn how to build trust in new ways. In this session, we will explore how digital nomads, virtual entrepreneurs, and global organizations are reaching through the screens to collaborate seamlessly at a distance. You will walk away with new ideas for what it means to be present at work and how to create that sense camaraderie even when you're virtual. This session complements the session Judy Rees is facilitating. Attend both for full remote mastery!\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
