description: "It's time to SAFE the Internet Introducing SAFE, the decentralised privacy-first storage and communication network\nby Benjamin Kampmann\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2017\n\nServers are hacked. Passwords leaked. Personal information stolen. DNSDDoS'ed. Cloud services are mining and exploiting everything they can gettheir hands on. The core problem; centralised server infrastructure.\n\nIn this talk, we will introduce you to SAFE, a decentralised privacy-firstopen source data storage and communications network enabling anyone to developdecentralised, secure, privacy-concealing apps.\n\nThere is no more denying it; the server-centric infrastructure has failed us:personal information mined, private photos are stolen, passwords leaked,entire infrastructures DDoS'ed – en masse. We are doomed!\n\nBut are we? Actually, as engineers, we know better: a decentralised networkhas the highest reliability. With distributed computing resources that canscale up and down on-demand and aren't bound by physical limitations. Andwe've been building these systems, clusters of databases across data centres,successfully for years – in our server backends. On the public internet,however, we are still using a single point of failure infrastructures: DNS,single endpoint IPs.\n\nBut issues with the existing Internet infrastructure don't stop there:government firewalls can block web services for entire countries, our plaintext communication is heavily surveilled, and companies mine our most personaland private data for their profit. To protect one's privacy, people have toresort to obfuscation protocols like Tor – with significant drawbacks likeslower connectivity and worsened user experience. But even then the data isstill stored, exploited and stolen from the centralised \"cloud providers\".\n\nIt is time that we bring those concepts of distributed computing,decentralised storage and communication out of the data centres into the realmof the wider internet. Combine that with an obfuscating peer-2-peer routingmechanism, a transparent, self-encrypting public-key-infrastructure andautomatic data retention, and you have covered the basics of what the opensource SAFE Network software provides.\n\nIn this talk, we explore the SAFE Network, the underlying DHT-based routing,and the XOR-namespace and how they are used to successfully concealsconnectivity and even metadata itself by making it infeasible for an attackerto calculate the path data will travel. We will discover what it means tobuild privacy-first Apps on a network where all data is sandboxed per tenantand distributed over multiple machines. Furthermore, by taking a look at theAPIs SAFE provides and going through some example apps, we will learn how tostructure and build fully distributed, privacy-first Apps on SAFE today.\n\nFinally, we will take a look into the future of SAFE, what apps are indevelopment and how developers could alternatively be paid through the built-in currency based on the app usage rather than the exploitation of personaldata.\n\nSAFE, Secure Access for Everyone.\n\n\nRoom: Janson\nScheduled start: 2017-02-05 11:00:00"
