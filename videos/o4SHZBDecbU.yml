description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nSnoop - a Discovery Service for Java EE\n\nA common pattern when building systems based on distributed services is Service Discovery. And that is where Snoop comes in. It is a 100% Java EE alternative to solutions like Spring Cloud Eureka. Just as simple and at least as powerful. And no need for 3rd party frameworks.\n\nIvar Grimstad, Cybercom Sweden\n\nIvar Grimstad is an experienced software architect focusing on Enterprise Java.
