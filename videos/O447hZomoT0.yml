description: "It all started with a simple question : \"Can I make two Web pages on two different laptops communicate without any server?\"\n\nMany nights later, I found a crazy—​but fascinating—​solution : WebAudio enabled ultrasounds to initiate a WebRTC connection! To be or not to be a good idea, that is not the question. I learned a lot and I want to share this adventure with you.\n\nHubert Sablonnière \nI'm a curious and passionnate Web developer. I'm specialized in HTML, CSS and JavaScript but I also use server side technologies like NodeJS, PHP, Java, Neo4j, Docker...\n\nWith OpenDevise I help clients to move their trainings and conference talks to the next level.\n\nMy motivation : \"To push the technology far enough to find new ways to improve user's experiences.\""
