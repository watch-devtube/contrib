description: "Speaker: Udara Alwis\n\nXamarin.Forms ships with most common cross platform controls out of the box, and there is a certain process of how Xamarin.Forms user interface rendering is executed.\n\nXamarin Forms also let us override this process of rendering to customize it to our own requirements. This provides an incredible flexibility of complex UI customizations for Xamarin.Forms development, and there are certain key points that we need to pay attention to when we use Custom Renderers.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.meetup.com/NET-Developers-SG/events/230193854/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/IRkl/"
