description: "Whether you realize it or not, we are currently entering the era of artificial intelligence. AI technologies will radically transform our economy, our society, and our lives. As a result, the software industry is preparing for a major transition as well. However, most developers do not yet possess the skills necessary to remain relevant in our new data-driven economy.\n\nIn this session, we will learn about modern artificial intelligence. We'll learn why it’s important and how it will impact you, your career, and our future. We’ll also learn how a series of modern technologies including The Internet of Things, Big Data, and machine learning are combining to create fully autonomous intelligent systems. \n\nEVENT:\n\nBuild Stuff 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMatthew Renze\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nBuild Stuff Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAxPCT4VwlI"
