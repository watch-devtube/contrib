description: "Further information: https://foss-backstage.de/session/diversity-and-inclusion-free-open-source-software\n\nSpeakers: Camila Ayres, Jan-Christoph Borchardt & Charlie Kritschmar \n\nDiversity & inclusion is very important especially for free & open source community, because:\n\n- People in tech nowadays are hired to a big part because of their open source contributions. To improve the balance there, the free & open source software community is an important starting point.\n- More diverse teams make for more innovation and serving users better than homogenous teams.\n- Diverse open source projects are more welcoming and friendly towards new contributors, encouraging learning and collaboration.\n\nWe are building http://opensourcediversity.org to collect the projects and resources in this field. It is aimed at maintainers and contributors of open source projects who want to improve, as well as people from underrepresented groups who are interested in free & open source software but don’t know where to start.\n\nThis talk is a showcase of the different initiatives for diversity & inclusion existing in open source, and a start for discussion where we can improve more."
