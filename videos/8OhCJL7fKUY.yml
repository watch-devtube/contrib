description: "It's All About Delivering: A Journey From AWS to Cloud Foundry - Daniel Basten, Talanx Group\n\nDeveloping new business opportunities within an insurance company can be challenging.\n\nYou need to convince the business not to plan for years ahead but to \"build, measure and learn\" in small iterations and gain the most value out of your product. To achieve this you need agile minds, tools and also a platform that can handle that agility.\n\nThis is a case study of how an established company, dealing in legit business, accomplished some amazing things. This talk will be about how we started in a rush with spring boot on AWS and adopted our technology stack to AxonFramework based event sourcing in mid-project phase. Then, how maintaining our AWS stack kept us more and more distracted from developing actual business value and how we finally found our home on the cloud foundry platform hosted on AWS\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRzH/its-all-about-delivering-a-journey-from-aws-to-cloud-foundry-daniel-basten-talanx-group"
