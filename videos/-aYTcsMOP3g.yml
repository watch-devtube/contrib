title: 'JSR 236: Introduction to Concurrency Utilities for Java EE 1.0'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784705
description: "Concurrency Utilities for Java EE is a new addition to the Java EE 7 platform. It adds asynchronous capabilities to Java EE application components through APIs that are mainly extensions of the concurrency utilities in Java SE. It provides a standard way for Java EE applications to submit asynchronous tasks and obtain managed threads from the Java EE application servers. This session provides an overview of Concurrency Utilities for Java EE 1.0. It discusses the four types of managed objects provided—ManagedThreadFactory, ManagedExecutorService, ManagedScheduledExecutorService, and ContextService—and walks through some code examples to illustrate how they can be used in an Java EE application.\n\n\nAuthors:\nFred Rowe\nFred is the WebSphere Architect for a number of Application Server components including those responsible for JEE managed concurrency, JCA (Java Connector Architecture), and database connectivity and connection management.  Fred has worked at IBM for 10 years in various development roles including Senior I/T architect in the GBS division on wireless technologies and RFID, and then in the SWG division on the WebSphere Application Server.  Prior to IBM, he worked as a Senior Software Engineer in wireless and telecom doing application and network management development. \n\nView more trainings by Fred Rowe at https://www.parleys.com/author/fred-rowe\n\nAnthony Lai\nAnthony Lai is a UX Architect at Oracle Corporation.
