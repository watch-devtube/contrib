description: "Have you heard about Diego for a while now, but wonder what it means to you as an application developer or operator? Have you experienced the magic of pushing an application to Cloud Foundry and want to know what makes it all possible behind the scenes? \n\nOver the past year, the Diego container runtime has made tremendous strides, reaching feature parity with the existing DEA runtime, making its deployments easily upgradable, and scaling to manage larger and larger container workloads. In this talk, the project lead for the Diego team will review the components of the Diego system, how they interact with each other, and how they integrate with existing Cloud Foundry deployments to allow a straightforward transition to the new runtime. We will also discuss how the Diego runtime enables many powerful new platform features, such as CF Tasks, TCP routing, and SSH access to containers, and preview other upcoming features that CF teams are actively working on and exploring today. \n\nAfter watching this talk you’ll be ready to upgrade to Diego with confidence and take advantage of the many improvements it brings to Cloud Foundry.\n\nEric Malm\nPivotal Software\nEric works at Pivotal Software as the Product Manager for the CF Runtime Diego team, and prior to that was a software engineer on the Diego team and on the CF Runtime team. He also holds a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Stanford University."
