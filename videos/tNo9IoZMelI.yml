description: "Got an app that makes bookings, such as for dining, travel, concerts or other events? Enhance your users’ experience by inserting events into their calendars. The trouble with apps today is that users STILL have to do it themselves even if your app books the reservations. \n\nTake a load off their shoulders & have your app do it. It's easier than you think, and your users will be delighted: \"Yay! I don't have to do it!\" Bring about a higher rate of engagement and delight your users so they'll always bring up your app instead of the competition's.\n\nThe Launchpad Online series is a set of videos geared to get you, your idea, your startup, or your enterprise onboard building with Google tools and APIs.
