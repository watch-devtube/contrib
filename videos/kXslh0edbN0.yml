title: 'The hypocrisy of hypotheses in HDD | Sharon McGee | CukenFest London 2017'

description: "Hypothesis driven development (HDD) drives business value. Framing product features as hypotheses and conducting mini experiments allows us to assess whether they will deliver pre-stated measurable business goals. Future product direction can then be informed by the results of our experiments.\n\nScientific experiments are designed to falsify hypotheses. By contrast, HDD tries to prove that hypotheses are true by observing some predefined acceptance criteria. This talk will explore the reasons why this approach may be misleading by revealing underlying assumptions and potential pitfalls. Attendees will discover how to inject some rigour (where needed) through an understanding of confounding factors, sampling, triangulation, comparison, and other experimentation protocols. Awareness of the scientific limitations of this approach to software development will help ensure that the results of hypothesis driven experiments mean what we think they mean.\n\nSharon McGee recently returned to her role of business analyst after a period of time during which she did lots of other interesting things! These include looking after her children, and completing an empirically based PhD on the causes and consequences of software requirements change. She enjoys trying to figure out what makes people tick, and designing software that makes people happy. She has presented at international conferences before – mainly academic – and appreciates meeting like-\nminded people."
