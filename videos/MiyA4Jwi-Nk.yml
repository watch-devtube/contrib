description: 'It might be a surprise for some of you, but JavaScript can be regarded as a functional programming language. Why don''t we use more functional programming concepts in our JavaScript code, then? In this talk you will learn how to start including some of them in your applications and when they might be particularly beneficial. You will also get familiar with libraries that extend the functional capabilities of JavaScript (lodash and FunctionalJS) and the upcoming ES6 features that make JavaScript even more functional.'
