A Worldwide Problem?\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications.\" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!\n\nThe problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nOpportunities for Hadoopers!\n\nOpportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!
