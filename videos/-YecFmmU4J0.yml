description: "The Joy Of SSE: how to push and push and push (your data) and then make it sizzle! by Darren Cook  \n(QQ Trend Ltd.)\n\n\nSSE is a lesser known HTML5 API for pushing data from servers to browsers. It is very simple to use, and slides into your existing infrastructure with barely a ripple. While we will borrow some examples from the Data Push Apps with HTML5 SSE book.\n\nDarren Cook has more than 20 years of experience as a software developer and technical director, working on everything from financial trading systems, through data visualization tools, through PR websites for some of the world's largest brands, all the way to arcade games. He is skilled in a wide range of computer languages, mostly using C++, R, PHP and JavaScript recently. He is also author and public speaker, and his new book, published by O'Reilly (1-4493-7193-0), is on using HTML5's SSE to push data from servers to clients."
