description: "DevConf - The Software Craftsmen Festival for Sharing Knowledge and Inspiration (https://devconf.pl/)\n\nConventional wisdom seems to be that the world is changing at an alarming rate. Technology is evolving rapidly and businesses better keep up or risk annihilation. As technologists, we are called upon to fight in the front lines of this impending revolution. Bring us disruption, they say. Think out of the box, they demand. The question that begs the asking - whose ideas are we actually disrupting? From whose suffocating box must our thoughts dare to break free? A conflict of interest arises when those that must usher in radical change have their identities intricately intertwined with the technological relics that must be left behind. When we speak of a revolution, we assume it’s targeted at some external repressive authority. But when it is our own work and our once brilliant ideas that are standing in the way of progress, the first battle we must fight is with our own ego. How do we let go of what once brought us glory and embrace the vulnerability of repeatedly feeling like a novice?"
