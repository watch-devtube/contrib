description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nExpression Templates is one of this C++ idiom people learn to either love or hate. The main issues with ET is that everubody has its own conception about what they are, when they should be used, what benefits they give and what are their trade off. For a long time, Expression Tempaltes has been seen has a way to improve temporary heavy code. If the seminal implementation of ET by Todd Veldhuizen was actually about this, the landscape has changed since C++11 and C++14.\n\nThis workshop will go over : - what are exactly Expression Templates and what kind of use case they can solve elegantly and efficiently - what are the benefits that one may reap by using expression tempalte in its library - what are the real cost of expressont empaltes both at runtime and compile-time - which tools to use to not reinvent the tempalte wheel everytime including an introduction to Boost.PROTO an Boost.HANA.\n\nThe main objective is to clarify why, even in C++1*, this idiom has a meaningful set of applciations and how to navigate around its pitfalls.\n— \nJoel Falcou is an assistant professor at the University Paris-Sud and researcher at the Laboratoire de Recherche d’Informatique in Orsay, France. His research focuses on studying generative programming idioms and techniques to design tools for parallel software development. The two main parts of those works are: exploration of Embedded Domain Specific Language design for parallel computing on various architectures and the definition of a formal framework for reasoning about meta-programs and prove their compile-time correctness. Applications range from real-time image processing on embedded architectures to High Performance Computing on multi-core clusters. He is a NumScale SAS scientific advisor. NumScale mission is to assist businesses in the exploration and subsequently the mastery of high-performance computing systems.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
