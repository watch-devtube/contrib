description: "Systems are increasingly complex and distributed, and standard metrics, monitoring, and logging aren’t enough: they catch known unknowns and send real-time updates – but what about what you don’t know? How do you set up a system that helps you see what you care about now and prepare for what you'll want to know in the future?\n\nChristine Yen, Chief Product Officer and co-founder at Honeycomb.io, joins Lachie Evenson to break down how she thinks about observability - from the problems it solves to why it's like peeling an onion - and demos how to instrument your code and make it easier to ask and answer questions (read: observable). \n\n00:26 What is observability?\n01:16 Explaining observability (tangible examples)\n02:08 Contrasting observability and traditional monitoring\n03:29 Check out Christine's demo\n08:03 Christine's instrumentation tip\n\nCheck out a previous episode with Christine, Intro to Observability: https://www.aka.ms/Intro_To_Observability\n\nExplore Open Source @ Microsoft.: https://opensource.microsoft.com\n\nCheck out Honeycomb.io's Achieving Observability guide: https://www.honeycomb.io/resources/guide-achieving-observability/\n\nRead the Honeycomb blog: \nhttps://www.honeycomb.io/blog/\n\nRead about monitoring and observability on Cindy Sridharan's blog: \nhttps://medium.com/@copyconstruct/monitoring-and-observability-8417d1952e1c\n\n\nVisit the free Honeycomb.io sandbox to explore and see what observability is like in real life:\nhttps://www.honeycomb.io/play/\n\nCheck out this year's 011ycon presentations: https://o11ycon.io/o11ystage/\n\nCreate a free account (Azure):  https://aka.ms/OpenSourceShow/10"
