description: "Bruno Souza, Programmer / Developer, ToolsCloud\n\nElias Nogueira, Software Engineer in Test, Sicredi\n\nMove fast and reduce risks while delivering your best application ever. When you trust your pipeline, you can increase your development speed, because you know you will catch bugs before they reach production. Doing unit tests is a first step, but in today’s cloud-based, distributed architectures, you need to apply other testing strategies as well. This interactive presentation shows how you can use state-of-the-art open source testing tools to create a fast and trustworthy testing pipeline. Starting from an end-to-end distributed Java EE application based on REST and microservices, the presenters test both the server side and its web and mobile front ends."
