description: "Matthew Butt demonstrates how to compose simple automated refactoring steps in ReSharper to refactor code to better designs.\n\nIn this episode we spot a conditional with three branches. We Decompose this Conditional to clarify the logic, and then Extract Method Objects to encapsulate the behaviour of each branch. By the time we've finished, we are well on our way to implementing polymorphism.\n\nThe code used in this video can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/bnathyuw/Complex-Refactoring-In-Simple-Steps"
