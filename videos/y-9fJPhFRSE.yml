description: "Zero to Hero: Start the DevOps transformation today!\n\nChris Lundy, Global Enterprise Architect for Columbia Sportswear, Columbia Sportswear \nJessica DeVita, Sr. PM on Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), Microsoft \n\nDevOps is a major transformation in the way work gets done. \"Major\" because it has had an incredible impact on development speed, system reliability, and developer happiness. \"Major\" also because it takes expertise, practice, and commitment. So, to begin the DevOps transformation, all you need to do is take a bunch of classes, get some certifications, and gain lots of valuable experience.\n\nBut who has time for that? We need to get work done.\n\nThis presentation will demonstrate how to begin the DevOps journey through an example project. We will show how to setup a project from scratch with version control, continuous integration / continuous delivery, testing, and documentation. While this is not a replacement for learning about Agile/Kanban/etc, it will introduce you to the core ideas of DevOps with concrete practical steps. But this is not just a talk for beginners. Through the same tooling, we can construct incredible systems for driving development. Columbia Sportswear show how they integrated chat bots into their development workflow and scale best practices in their company.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
