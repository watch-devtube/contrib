description: "Cryptocurrency can be a high-risk, high-reward game for those willing to deal with the volatility. Can we use AI to help us make predictions about Bitcoin's future price? In this video, i'll show you how to build a simple Bitcoin trading bot using an LSTM neural network in Keras. Along the way I'll explain why we use LSTM networks through code and animations, as well as a review of the vanishing gradient problem.   \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Bitcoin_Trading_Bot\n\nPlease Subscribe!
