description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Craig Walls\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/booting-up-spring-social\nApplied Spring Track\nIn recent years, people are using social networks like Facebook and Twitter to connect, meet, and share experiences and ideas. But it's not just people making connections; modern applications are also leveraging the APIs provided by the social networks to connect with their users and customers. It's hard to find applications these days that aren't somehow connected to their users via social APIs.\n\nSpring Social is an extension to the Spring Framework that enables you to create applications that connect with APIs. With it, your application can offer social login, learn about its users' interests, and inject itself into their social graph.\n\nIn this session, we'll take a look at the latest that Spring Social has to offer, including integration with Spring Security, automatic reconnect, and a dramatically simpler configuration model using Spring Boot."
