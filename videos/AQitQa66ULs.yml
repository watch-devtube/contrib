description: "It’s easy to practice agile software development, but is that enough? Can an agile IT organisation thrive in a company that is still transforming, or perhaps, not even aware that business agility means more than just agile Software development? Agile product development means much more than adopting scrum, for both the product and technical sides of an organisation.\n\nAbout the speaker: I have experience of talking to groups from both my job, and user groups around Dublin. My role is IT architect for a number of agile teams and i work closely with the scrum masters to improve our implementation of agile and push agile adoption at all levels.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisloweireland"
