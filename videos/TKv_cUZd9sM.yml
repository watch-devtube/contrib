description: "Speaker:\nShirley Wu @sxywu\nNadieh Bremer @NadiehBremer\n\nIn this workshop, we will cover the basics of SVG - especially SVG paths and the cubic bezier curve command - as well as an introduction to D3.js's selection, data-binding, and enter-update-exit patterns. The culmination of the workshop will be to create a set of flowers out of movie data, a simpler version of the film flowers here. \n\nRequirements: Just a laptop and working knowledge of Javascript and the web.\n\nShirley is a freelance software engineer specializing in data visualization. She combines her love of art, math, and code into colorful, interactive data visualizations. She enjoys finding fun insights in data and weaving them into stories and exploratory tools for the reader to discover. Her work can be found at sxywu.com. \n\nNadieh is a graduated Astronomer, turned Data Scientist, turned self-taught Data Visualization Designer.
