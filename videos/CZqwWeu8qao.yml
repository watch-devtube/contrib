description: "by Johannes Kliemann\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.125/ada_bindings.webm\n\n\nWriting Ada bindings for C and especially for C++ is a tedious but not necessarily sophisticated task. There are several approaches to both C and C++ but many of them lack desired language features, generate non-compilable code or are project specific. With Cappulada (a coinage of coupling, CPP and Ada made pronounceable) we try a more general approach that aims to support complex language features such as templates or inheritance while providing a semantically appropriate mapping of object structures and types. The talk will also cover which features can be mapped and what is not feasible or possible. \n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 17:30:00+01"
