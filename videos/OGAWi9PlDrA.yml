description: "Automating Enterprise Governance Using the CI/CD Pipeline - Satyam Agarwala, ThoughtWorks & Mark Angrish, ANZ \n\nANZ bank has been on a transformation journey to achieve greater business agility.   A key initiative in that journey has been the creation of ANZ flavoured \"paved roads\" (inspired by Netflix), realised as self-service CI and CD pipelines, that allow delivery teams to deploy software to production (Google Kubernetes Engine) faster without compromising on quality, security or compliance.   A vital characteristic of the \"paved roads\" is the automation of the governance process the bank has in place for change management. These are driven by some of the strictest financial regulations in the world. This was achieved by integrating open source tooling such as Grafeas and Kritis into the pipelines to track build metadata and enforce policy.  In this talk we will discuss the benefits the approach provided in meeting the strict regulatory requirements while accelerating the journey to GKE. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrSw"
