description: "by Shelley Lambert\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1302/tested_business.webm\n\n\nWith the proliferation of OpenJDK binaries for a developer or a business to\nchoose from, one factor in determining the selection is quality.  How do\nyou know your choice is up to snuff?  The AdoptOpenJDK Quality Kit is an\nopen and transparent verification story for OpenJDK binaries.  A robust and\nadaptable test kit that can be utilized by any OpenJDK implementor, and\nrepresents the quality bar required by large-scale customers in enterprise\nenvironments.  We test multiple freely available JDK implementations at\nAdoptOpenJDK and continue to refine this suite of tests to give the\ncommunity access to high-quality binaries. \n\nBeyond a frank discussion starter on the criteria by which we measure\nquality, this talk summarizes the real quality requirements of enterprise\ncustomers and presents a compelling story for verifying and/or selecting\nyour OpenJDK implementation. \n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 17:20:00+01"
