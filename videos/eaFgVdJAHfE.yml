description: 'Sam has been a software developer professionally for the last 8 years, but has been programming just for fun from a long-long time ago! Sam loves Agile, TDD and Clean code. But over all the software craftsmanship movement, he is a DDD evangelist and  of course an active member and sometimes host of the London software craftsmanship meetup group. Sam likes to continuously learn from his failures. Kaizen is the motto.'
