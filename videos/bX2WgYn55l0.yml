description: "Autoupgrade BOSH Packages - Oleksandr Slynko & Akshay Mankar, Pivotal\n\nKeeping Bosh release update is hard. It requires constant following the next releases and testing. Cloud Foundry Container Runtime struggled with it, but then worked on automatic bumping packages. In this talk, Oleksandr will tell how is it implemented, what are benefits and risks and how the team fixes deprecations without spending too much time on upgrades.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyK/autoupgrade-bosh-packages-oleksandr-slynko-akshay-mankar-pivotal"
