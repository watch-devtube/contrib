description: "Speaker: Prasanta Bhattacharya\n\n\"Social networks are everywhere and have fascinated researchers for many centuries. Now, with the proliferation of internet-based platforms and big data, the systematic treatment of online social networks is steadily gaining importance. This talk would introduce the audience to social network datasets, and help define and characterize the different types of data that get generated on such platforms. We will talk about ways to acquire, store, visualize and analyze such types of data for predictive analytics as well as causal inferencing, with a special focus on data complexities and challenges that are common in such networked contexts. Wherever relevant, code snippets and common tools will be demonstrated.\"\n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nPrasanta Bhattacharya holds a Ph.D in Information Systems from the Department of Information Systems and Analytics, National University of Singapore, where he studied computational social science. His broader research agenda focuses on the interplay between an individual's online and offline behaviour in specific contexts (e.g. social media, search engines etc.). He is currently working as a Scientist with the Social Intelligence group at the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC) where he works on behavioural analytics. \n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/PyData-SG/events/235981787/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/9VD2/"
