description: 'Presented by Bradford Stephens. Building distributed systems is painful. Many organizations are approaching the point where their data and application infrastructures are being run on many servers (in the cloud or datacenter).

This talk is a collection of scalability principles, anecdotes and practices from experts (and personal experience) from engineering, operations, and business perspectives.'
