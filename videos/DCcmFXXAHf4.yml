description: "Can AI be used to detect various diseases from a simple body scan? Yes! Normally, doctors train for years to do this and the error rate is still relatively high. From mammograms to cat scans, AI can diagnose a disease better than any human can if given the right training dataset. This will drastically reduce patient death, save medical practices a lot of money, and aid doctors in the patient care process. Everyone will win and its important to remember that AI won't replace doctors, it will become the most powerful tool they've ever used. And once enough AI startups start impacting the field of healthcare, it will become as common a tool as the stethoscope has been. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/AI_in_Medicine_Clinical_Imaging_Classification\n\nPlease Subscribe!
