The conventional wisdom is that granting friendship is something you do should sparingly. This lecture introduces a distinctive use for friend function declarations in class templates that's not about granting access to non-public members. Rather, it's about using a template as a \nfactory for \"making\" new friends. Along the way, this session explains various subtleties about operator overloading, overload resolution, \ntemplate instantiation, and name lookup for friend functions. \n— \n\nDan Saks, Saks & Associates\nPresident\n\nDan Saks is the president of Saks & Associates, which offers training and consulting in C and C++ and their use in developing embedded systems.
