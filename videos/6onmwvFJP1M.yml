description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nTim Park - Part of the Platform Strategy Team at Microsoft\n\nABSTRACT\nNode.js is one of the most rapidly growing developer ecosystems, given its applicability to building APIs and efficiency of streaming data, two of the most common modern workloads. In this very hands-on session, Tim will walk you through Microsoft's support for node.js across a range of its platforms. You'll walk out of the session being able to continuously deploy a node.js application to Azure Web Sites using nothing more than git and the command line, debug a node.js application using Visual Studio, provision and connect to a MongoDB instance, and scale your website to automatically meet demand. \n\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
