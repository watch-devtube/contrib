description: "Speaker: Gabe Hollombe, Neo Innovation\n\nPytest is a great alternative testing framework to unittest from the standard library. It often lets you get the same tests written with far fewer lines of code, and it has a cool dependency injection system to help you share common test dependencies while keeping your tests understandable.  I'll tell you all about how to get basic unit testing done, and I'll show you how to use Voidspace's Mock library to test collaborations between your objects, too.\n\nGabe is a full-stack senior engineer at Neo Innovation, with a thirst for knowledge and a passion for sharing what he's learned. He's had the pleasure of speaking on four different continents about JavaScript, Ruby, Vim, and HTML5 Game development. \n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCjV/"
