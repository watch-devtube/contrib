Go! With 2K of memory it was powerful enough to run the then massive Lyons business. But it wasn't long, in 1955, before Big Data came calling in the form of a request from British Rail to calculate the shortest distance between every one of their 5,000 railway stations.\n\nThe British Rail network was, of course, a graph with edges labelled with the distance between the stations, but graph algorithms hadn't been invented yet. Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm which is widely used today wouldn't be described until 1959. And with 5,000 stations there were 12.5 million distance pairs to calculate exceeding the memory capacity of LEO by four orders of magnitude (equivalent today of a single large machine being faced with a petabyte to calculate).\n\nWhat could be more modern? Data that exceeds available memory by orders of magnitude; a graph structure; the need for new algorithms.\n\nIn this talk I'll tell the story of Roger Coleman who worked out how to partition the problem into manageable parts, discovered Dijkstra's algorithm, and hand coded the solution in assembly language."
