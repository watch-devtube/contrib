description: "Filmed at http://2015.dotjs.io on December 7th in Paris. More talks on http://thedotpost.com\nAndre explores reactive programming, a paradigm centered on one idea: specifying the dynamic behavior of a variable only at the declaration of that variable. The benefits of this approach are the use of declarative programming and a better separation of concerns."
