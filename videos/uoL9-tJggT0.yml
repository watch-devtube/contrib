description: "Reactive programming is not a new concept, but it痴 quickly becoming the shiny new toy as its popularity increases thanks to frameworks like Angular2 and ReactJS. Like all new paradigms, reactive programming brings a lot of questions. What is an Observable ? A Subject ? Are observable Lazy ? Synchronous ? Asynchronous ? What are Hot and Cold Observables ? Why is my Observable not doing anything ? In this presentation, I値l introduce the core concepts of reactive programming independantly of the rest, and try to show that reactive programming is not only the new hype thing. After that, I値l do a live-coding of an observable from scratch to show that there痴 nothing magical in RxJS and that the questions about reactive programming are not so hard to answer. Finally, I値l introduce CycleJS, a tiny framework that allows people to develop a web application entirely in reactive programming.\n\nBenoit Averty (Zenika)\nI知 a consultant, trainer and speaker at Zenika Rennes. I知 passionate about software engineering and I love both frontend and backend development, and I try to always keep in mind software craftsmanship and best practices.
