description: "Project Tango is a new platform that allows mobile devices to track their motion.\n\nUsers of Project Tango can move untethered around to explore virtual worlds. If the virtual space is small, like an ice floe, the users’ surroundings may cause them to accidentally exit the experience.\n\nBoundaries occurs when the virtual world is either smaller than the physical or when the physical world can’t fit the virtual. \n\nIn this episode Nicolai Munk Petersen talks about the virtual boundaries and how to prevent them from causing problems.\n\nWatch more episodes of Project Tango here: https://goo.gl/mmC3JA\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L -\nSubscribe to the brand new Firebase Channel: https://goo.gl/9giPHG"
