description: "Google Tech Talks\nMay 14, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMuch of what we know about innovation is wrong. That's the bet this talk takes, as it romps through the history of innovation, dispelling the mythologies we've constructed about how we got here. This talk, loosely based on the upcoming O'Reilly book (May 2007), will help you to recognize the myths, understand why they're popular (even if you don't believe in them), and how to use the truth to help you innovate today.\n\nSpeaker: Scott Berkun  Credits: Speaker:Scott Berkun"
