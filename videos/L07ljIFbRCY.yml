description: "Jim offers a positive outlook at what the software industry have been going through with application security and how it has improved.\n\nJim Manico, Founder and Lead Trainer Manicode Security, expressively chronicles the application security narrative in his AppSec Cali 2019 talk, \"The Extremely Unabridged History of Application Security.\" From a DARPA Grant in 1967 for the publication of R609 by the DOD in February, 1970, to the influence of OWASP in municipalities and world-wide application security structure in 2019, Manico proclaims that security is getting better. He completes his declaration of OWASP as helping the world be more secure, and asserts, \"It's not fun to be a salmon all the time, but we keep going, and we remember how far we've come and that you're a part of it.\"\n\nJim Manico is the founder of Manicode Security where he trains software developers on secure coding and security engineering. He is also the founder of Brakeman Security, Inc. and is a investor/advisor for Signal Sciences and BitDiscovery. Jim is also a frequent speaker on secure software practices, is a member of the JavaOne rockstar speaker and Java Champion community and is the author of \"Iron-Clad Java: Building Secure Web Applications\" from McGraw-Hill and Oracle Press. Jim also volunteers for the OWASP foundation where he helps build application security standards and other documentation.\n\nhttps://2019.appseccalifornia.org/\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
