description: 'Distributed companies and organizations are getting more visibility nowadays, but how does it work in practice, day to day, to design while being remote? This talk explores how a completely distributed team works, following the steps of Hyperion, one of the teams that worked on the new "Calypso" WordPress.com. The audience will be able to see in a deeper detail how a distributed team is organized and it will get a few driving principles on how to make it work for your own remote or distributed team.'
