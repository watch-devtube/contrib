recordingDate: 1367254713
description: "http://g.co/gtac2013\nSlides: http://goo.gl/9VY2b\n\nJames Waldrop, Twitter\n\nJames will be discussing the tools, process, and philosophy that goes into performance testing at Twitter. Particular emphasis will be placed on the Iago open source load testing library, which he wrote to enable Twitter's engineering teams to perform load tests before deploying code to production. The talk will dive into implementation details of some of these tests (including source code) and how complicating factors such as OAuth and arbitrary Thrift protocols are managed."
