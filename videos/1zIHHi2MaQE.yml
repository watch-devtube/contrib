description: 'With a slew of benefits, GraphQL also introduces its own set of hurdles. With best practices yet to be discovered for many use-cases, careful consideration upfront is imperative. This talk aims to highlight issues less obvious at the beginning of a GraphQL-enabled project, with special focus on dealing with development and maintenance of a GraphQL schema. An approach leveraging dynamic schema generation is proposed in attempt to lower the effort needed to expose new or existing Java services while keeping the schema at all times in sync with the changes.'
