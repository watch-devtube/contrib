recordingDate: 1431021466
description: "By, Michael Chan\nReact is the best way to bring interactive UIs to your Rails apps. But using React.js on Rails can be hard. NPM libraries are difficult to include, JSX seems nonsensical, and 田an we still use CoffeeScript?能n\nThere痴 not one obvious path for working with React.js on Rails. In this talk, we値l review the sordid past of Rails and JavaScript, explore the complementarity of React and Rails, and navigate the woes of integrating with NPM. We値l discover why React is a natural fit for Rails today and how to make Rails love React in the future."
