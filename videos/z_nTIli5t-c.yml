It is a description of what you want done, example: VIEW VIDEO, PLAY GAME etc.\n\nThey are commands which when called would act as communicators between the three core components of Android, i.e. Activities, Services and Broadcast Receivers.\n\nWhile you are interacting with one activity, you might want to switch to another one; this is done by defining a proper Intent for the action. Here one Activity uses Intent to request the launch of another Activity. Thus, it is evident that using intents, one Android component can request action from the other components of Android.\n\nThree of the core components of an application — activities, services, and broadcast receivers — are activated through messages, called intents.\n\n\nIntent Types : \n-------------------\nDelving further, Intents can be Explicit or Implicit.\n\nExplicit Intent:\n\nAn Explicit Intent is exactly what it means literally: an \"explicit intention\" to perform an action. Simply put, in this case, we define explicitly the Android component (Activity, Service or Broadcast Receiver) that needs calling.\n\nImplicit Intent : \n\nHere we do not specifically define the component that needs to be called. However, the Intent contains enough information to direct the system to fetch the correct one.\n\n\nKnow more about intents : http://www.edureka.co/blog/android-tutorials-intent-component/\n\nWatch all videos of this series by clicking here : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ooVrP1hQOEAe1-V7WwojKmPbpBRDDQu\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease write back to us at support@edureka.in or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information.\n\nhttp://www.edureka.co\n\nVisit - http://www.edureka.co/android-development-certification-course"
