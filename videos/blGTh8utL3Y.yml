description: "Slides and more info:http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016/ulf-wiger\n\nThe Remote Vehicle Interaction (RVI) framework, which is evolving towards an automotive industry standard, needs to support multiple implementations and multiple transports. Still, having the initial implementation in Erlang offers us an opportunity to learn from the best that Erlang has to offer. Erlang is, after all, at its core an enabler for distributed asynchronous messaging applications. But which specific Erlang features can - and should - be emulated in a generic communication framework, and how? In this talk, I will try to explain how Erlang philosophy can simplify communication and client programming in the Internet of Things, and describe my approach to achieving some Erlang goodness in a slightly different context.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\nHighlight some core principles of Erlang and explore their general applicability.\n\nTarget audience:\n\nErlang programmers, people generally interested in communication protocols."
