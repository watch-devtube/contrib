language: English
recordingDate: 1372392235
description: "You have been doing agile for a few years now. With a regular cadence you have retrospectives and a lot of problems and great improvement opportunities are raised but nothing seems to really improve. Stop doing retrospectives!\nIt is time to take your improvement work to a whole new level! It's time to shift your focus form collecting problems to making small experiments! It's time to create the daily habits of continuous improvement. It is time to start using Toyota Kata!\nIn this session you will get a practical introduction to Toyota Kata. You will learn about the two Kata's, behavior patterns, of Toyota Kata. You will follow a team that goes through the two Kata's and improves its way of working."
