description: 'Pshhhkkkkkkrrrr?kakingkakingkakingtsh?chchchchchchchcch?dingdingding The siren song of the dialup modem that summoned AIM and the Book of Mozilla has a language unto itself. In this talk, we’ll learn how to implement an end-to-end frequency-shift keying modem, capable of sending and receiving data between computers using the Web Audio API.
