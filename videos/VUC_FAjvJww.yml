description: "Find more information here: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/stream-processor-database-building-online-applications-directly-streams-apache-flink-and\n\nWe present a new design pattern for data streaming applications, using Apache Flink and Apache Kafka: Building applications directly on top of the stream processor, rather than on top of key / value databases populated by data streams.\n\nUnlike classical setups that use stream processors or libraries to pre-process / aggregate events and update a database with the results, this setup simply gives the role of the database to the stream processor - here Apache Flink -, routing queries to its workers who directly answer them from their internal state computed over the log of events - Apache Kafka."
