recordingDate: 1542118876
description: ".NET Standard is the new way to create portable assemblies. After learning about portable class libraries in the past years, it is now time to upgrade our game and start coding for Linux, Mac OS and other platforms untouched by .NET until now. More and more libraries are getting ported to .NET Standard, sometimes really easily and sometimes more painfully.\nIn this session, Laurent Bugnion, the creator of the popular open source MVVM Light Toolkit, will help you understand why .NET Standard can benefit you, and talk about his experiences converting his framework to .NET Standard.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
