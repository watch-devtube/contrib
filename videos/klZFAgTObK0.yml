description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/cassandra-and-datastax-enterprise-on-pcf\n\nDataStax Enterprise (DSE) is a distributed database built on Apache Cassandra with support for Spark, Solr and graph database. Bringing DSE support to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry application platform allows developers and operators to self-service provision DSE clusters and easily connect them to Spring Boot apps running in and managed by PCF. In this session we’ll start with the use cases for on-demand, dedicated DSE clusters, cover the solution design, and demo the system. The creation of on-demand clusters takes full advantage of BOSH 2.0 and we’ll go just a little bit under the covers to show you how these new BOSH features rock this use case. Finally, we’ll complete the story by looking at the support that Spring has for Cassandra."
