title: 'Bert Jan Schrijver - The DevOps disaster: 15 ways to fail at DevOps'
language: Dutch
recordingDate: 1472203181
description: 'Getting DevOps right isn''t easy. It''s downright hard. In this talk, I''m not going to explain how to ''do'' DevOps in your organisation, since there is not just one ''right'' way to do it. What I can show you however, is how NOT to do DevOps. This session shares 15 common misconceptions, call them anti-patterns, of DevOps. I''ll talk from my own experiences in getting things wrong, explain why they are wrong and prevent you from making the same mistakes. You''ll leave this session with a basic understanding of how (not) to fail at DevOps and hopefully, a smile on your face ;-)'
