description: "In this video, I explain perhaps the most famous problem in all of Computer Science. Does P = NP? I define the terms and give examples of each. We also programmatically go through the traveling salesman problem. I experiment with a little bit of mixed reality in this video as well.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/p_vs_np_challenge\n\nNichole's winning code:\nhttps://github.com/nhrigby\n\nMick's runner-up code:\nhttps://github.com/mickvanhulst\n\nJoin the Wizard's Slack Channel:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nSome more great P vs NP resources:\nhttps://danielmiessler.com/study/pvsnp/\nhttps://qntm.org/pnp\nhttp://news.mit.edu/2009/explainer-pnp\nhttps://blog.codinghorror.com/the-girl-who-proved-p-np/\nhttps://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/the-astounding-link-between-the-p-np-problem-and-the-quantum-nature-of-universe-7ef5eea6fd7a\n\nPlease subscribe!
