description: "Over the last 5-10 years our computer's ability to understand our voice commands and pictures have made dramatic leaps forward - from barely being able to understand simple commands (or different accents) to comprehending complex commands or questions, the way we interact with computers is changing dramatically. And it's all down to machine learning. Machine learning has been around for a while but over the last 5-10 years three things have come together to provide a breakthrough in their abilities : the algorithms have gotten better by modelling the human brain, there is a lot more data available to train these systems, and more raw computing power than ever before to bring it all together. This combination changes how we develop products from endless if/else statements to simple algorithms with deep learning systems behind them.\n\nSo what does that mean for us as product managers? In this in-depth talk from Mind the Product San Francisco 2017 Aparna Chennapragada, Product Director and Technical Assistant to the CEO at Google, unpacks N ideas on how this will change how we think about products and experiences.\n\nEVENT:\n\nMind the Product San Francisco 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAparna Chennapragada\n\nPERMISSION:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nMind The Product conference: http://mtpcon.com/"
