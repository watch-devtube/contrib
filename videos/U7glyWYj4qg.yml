description: "Go combines patterns from the past along with new ideas to produce a new programing environment focused on developer productivity while addressing the rise in multi-core systems and the need for a sane programming model around concurrency. As Go has found its niche on the server side, a new programming paradigm has emerged with the aim of abstracting away many of the problems Go was designed to solve.\n\n\nServerless.\n\n\nAs its name implies, Serverless aims to eliminate the idea of servers, both physically and logically, and shift focus back to the core elements of programming: data structures and algorithms. In the form of typed events, Serverless platforms trigger programming logic on demand, and introduces tight restrictions on what that logic is able to do and for how long.\n\n\nLike Go, the Serverless paradigm borrows a few ideas from the past and adds a few tricks of its own. Serverless platforms reintroduce event-driven programming by striping away everything except data and the essential parts of a codebase required to process it. In essence, Serverless operates at the function level and does away with the boilerplate typically associated with building and managing network services.\n\n\nIn Kelsey’s talk, he will explore the benefits of event-driven architectures and the challenges of using Go in the Serverless context. He will also offer guidance on how developers can leverage idiomatic Go within the constraints of what most would consider a black box execution environment that challenges common assumptions around process lifecycle, debuggability, and performance characteristics held by most Go developers."
