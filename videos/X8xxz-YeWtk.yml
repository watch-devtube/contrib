OneJS exposes the power of programmable GPUs to UI designers and programmers in a very accessible way.\n\nNow the fixed functions encoded in CSS, Canvas or SVG are a thing of the past, and we can finally go beyond and explore.\n\nReleased at: https://github.com/onejs/onejs/\nSlides: http://hello.onejs.io/\nTranscript & Slides: http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/rik-arends-beyond-html-and-css-fusing-javascript-and-shaders-for-live-graphics-and-ui-programming.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
