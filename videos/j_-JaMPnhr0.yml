description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nIn many practical machine learning classification applications, the training data for one or all of the classes may be limited. We will examine how semi-supervised learning using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used to improve generalization in these settings. The full approach from training to model deployment will be demonstrated, using AWS Lambda and/or AWS Sagemaker\n\nLink: https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/using-gans-to-improve-generalization-in-a-semisupervised-setting-trying-it-in-open-datasets-andreas-merentitis-carmine-paolino-vaibhav-singh\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
