description: "Using Bosh Add-Ons to Customize your CF Experience [I] - Bridget Arthur & Josh Ghiloni, ECS Team    \n\nBosh add-ons are a new feature that allows teams to customize the virtual machines in their bosh deployment. Although this was previously accomplished through complex post-deploy orchestrations or fragile stemcell modifications, the bosh add-on is a simple, flexible mechanism that plugs directly into any existing bosh 2.0 manifest.\n\nOften times operators discover that the standard VM does not contain some of the VM-level monitoring tools commonly used in troubleshooting. Using this situation as a working example, attendees will learn:\n- The use cases for bosh add-ons\n- The details and mechanics of how add-ons work\n- How to create a bosh add-on\n- How to integrate it with an existing bosh deployment\n\nJosh Ghiloni\nECS Team\nSenior Cloud Architect\nGreater Denver Area\n\nJosh is a Principal Consultant and Senior Cloud Architect with ECS Team, a professional services firm based in Denver, CO. Throughout his career, Josh has developed applications and architectures ranging from traditional n-tier enterprise software solutions to microservice architectures on various flavors of Cloud Foundry.
