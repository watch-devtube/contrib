description: "Piloting Cloud Foundry into Containers - Then, Now, and Next - Sandy Cash, IBM & Troy Topnik, SUSE\n\nCreating a commercial Cloud Foundry distribution for a containerized environment brings up a number of challenges. Drawing on real-world experience providing a commercial Cloud Foundry distribution in which the entire stack runs on top of Kubernetes, this session summarizes the history of this style of Cloud Foundry deployment. Sandy and Troy examine some of the advantages of this approach as well as the challenges and solutions, including deploying Cloud Foundry, upgrading and scaling it, providing Cloud Foundry-as-a-Service, and staying in sync with upstream changes. They also describe development currently underway that brings containerized Cloud Foundry more closely in line with recent developments in BOSH.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyA/piloting-cloud-foundry-into-containers-then-now-and-next-sandy-cash-ibm-troy-topnik-suse"
