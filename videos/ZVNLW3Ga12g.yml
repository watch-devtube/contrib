description: "We can easily calculate the probabilities of independent events with some simple arithmetic.\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/probability-independent\n\nNew video every Thursday. Question? Leave a comment below, or ask me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/VinoBS\n\nEXERCISES:\n\n1. What is the probability that a person rolls snake eyes twice in a row?\n\n2. What is the probability that the sum of the two dice is seven twice in a row? Three times in a row?\n\n3. Your player opens two chests. Each chest has a 50% chance of giving the player an item, and a 50% chance of being empty. What is the probability that your player receives no item? What is the probability the player receives at least one item?\n\n4. Tricky: If you want the player to receive an item at least 90% of the time, how many chests do you need?"
