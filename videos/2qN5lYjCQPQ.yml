description: "While developers see and realize the benefits of Kubernetes, how it improves efficiencies, saves time, and enables focus on the unique business requirements of each project; InfoSec, infrastructure, and software operations teams still face challenges when managing a new set of tools and technologies, and integrating them into an existing enterprise infrastructure.\n\nDuring this webinar, Oleg will discuss what’s needed for a general architecture of a centralized Kubernetes operations layer based on open source components such as Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Keycloak, etc., and how to set up reliable clusters and multi-master configuration without a load balancer. He’ll also describe how these components should be combined into an operations-friendly enterprise Kubernetes management platform with centralized monitoring and log collection, identity and access management, and infrastructure management capabilities. This presentation will show real-world open source projects use cases to implement an ops-friendly environment."
