description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Hans Dockter, Gradleware\nMore Groovy Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/the-future-of-gradle-the-ultimate-build-system\nWe are convinced that Gradle is already the best available enterprise build system. Yet we are far from done. We have finally the R&D bandwidth to deeply improve Gradle in the areas where it lacks. We also have the bandwidth to contribute some fundamental innovation to the domain of build and continuous delivery. All this will bring Gradle much closer to our vision of Gradle being the ultimate build system.\n\nWe start by giving an overview of where Gradle is currently in the build system market when it comes to features and adoption. We will then talk about the next generation multi-platform dependency management. A dependency management that can fully capture the requirements of Android, JavaScript and the native domain as well as to improve the dependency management for the Java world. We will talk about how Gradle will dramatically improve the performance by introducing global caches and other optimizations. Finally we will talk about the new Gradle extendability model and its upcoming native and Javascript support."
