language: English
recordingDate: 1520753176
description: "Are you using or moving to AWS? Have you considered how you organize and secure your AWS environments? The growing push to cloud providers has allowed us to move faster and tackle problems more efficiently. The same freedoms that have allowed us to move faster have also created scenarios where security issues are exposed by accident and/or without proper management and review. As companies move toward more and more cloud usage, teams are pushed harder to ensure the same compliance and security requirements that exist in slower moving private environments. This has the potential to put us right back where we came from.\n\nJoin Aaron as he talks through the most critical security decisions you can make for you AWS environments.\n\nAaron Bedra is the CTO and Chief Scientist at Jemurai, where he works at the intersection of software, security, and business. He has served as a Chief Security Officer, Chief Technology Officer, and Principal Engineer/Architect. He has worked professionally on programming languages, most notably Clojure and ClojureScript.
