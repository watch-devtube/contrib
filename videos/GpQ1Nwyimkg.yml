description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/asotobu/testing-for-unicorns-77069262\n\nOne of the most important benefits of automated testing is to ensure a fast and safe code refactoring to evolve our system architecture. The main problem is how to write tests that are easy to write, easy to follow and not time consuming during development nor execution time.\n\nIn this session, we are going to explore some powerful Java testing libraries that will help you write better (unit) tests focusing on the main Unicorns architecture challenges such as validating microservices endpoints, remote calls to other microservices or just asynchronous/reactive code."
