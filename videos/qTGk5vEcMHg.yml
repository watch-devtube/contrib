description: "Graphs and maps from Max Roser’s Our World in Data have become a fixture on social media and in thoughtful conversations around the world. They provide deep historical and global context on centuries of progress about issues such as life expectancy, poverty, education, health, and income inequality. Much as Mary Meeker’s Internet Trends Report is eagerly studied by entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, Our World in Data is scrutinized for signs of where we are headed and what matters.  The history he unveils is fundamentally hopeful. Despite all the short-term worries about technological unemployment, Max reminds us that if we play our cards right, the future is still bright.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
