description: 'The model view presenter ( MVP ) is a robust architecture that allows us to break our application into smaller, modular, testable and composable component. But, it does not solve how to manage concurrent or async events in such a way that your app will still work smoothly and your code stay readable. To address the concurrency problem, one possible solution is to use RxJava. In this talk, we will explore how you can compose RxJava with MVP to create both a robust architecture and logical concurrency flow.'
