description: "Baby Got Back Ups: How to Leverage your CF Blobstore Provider to Improve your Backup Experience - Sarah Connor & Emmanouil Kiagias, Pivotal Cloud Foundry \n\nRegardless of how sturdy a platform is setup, disasters are inevitable and a platform will need to be restored. Usually, backups can be a headache to maintain, can take ages to complete and can start to eat away at storage costs.

The BOSH Backup and Restore cli can be used to backup and restore a CF foundation and provides a solid experience if configured properly.  This talk will cover how the setup of your platform impacts the size, speed and lifecycle management of your BBR backups.

Having a better understanding of these differences allows you make an informed decision about your backup strategy. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
