description: "JavaFX has many new exciting features for desktop Java application developers. This session goes over how you can transition an existing large Swing application to JavaFX. It specifically discusses how this transition was approached in the development of a large Swing application with more than 32 custom Swing components and more than 150 screens. This code-intensive presentation shares the challenges the developers have run into as well as the gaps they have hit in both Swing and JavaFX. It covers best practices for moving an application to JavaFX and how the developers are leveraging JavaFX while migrating their existing user interface.\n\n\nAuthor:\nRyan Cuprak\nundefined\nView more trainings by Ryan Cuprak at https://www.parleys.com/author/ryan-cuprak\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
