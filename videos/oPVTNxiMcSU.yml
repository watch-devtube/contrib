description: "Ionut G. Stan has been involved in software development for the past 7 years. He has started with simple, invalid HTML and worked from there through CSS, JS, PHP, Scheme, Haskell and Scala. Ionut G. Stan is particularly fond of functional programming.\n\nAt his day job Ionut G. Stan is building web applications using Scala. In his spare time, Ionut G. Stan study as much as he can about programming language design and compilers.\n\nThe talk: If you’ve ever wondered how your favourite compiler actually verifies your programs for type errors or how you might add type inference to a language like Java, then you will probably enjoy this talk.\n\nSee how to write a type checker for a simple, hypothetical language using Scala. In order to save time, we will not define a syntax for the vehicle language, but rather work directly on its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).\n\nThe language will support numbers, strings, records, arrays, variables and recursive functions.\n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E.
