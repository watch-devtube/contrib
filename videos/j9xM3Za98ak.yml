description: 'Over the last 15 years I''ve worked in enterprise IT, first in customer service, then in infrastructure and now in a more focused .NET development role. During that time the accomplishment I''m most proud of is that despite tens of thousands of customer interactions and phone calls I''ve never had a customer complaint against me during all my time in IT.I have spent nearly a decade in the Microsoft infrastructure stack especially Active Directory, SCCM, SQL, & Windows Server with a heavy dose of Powershell, C# and VB.NET and a sprinkling of Dell Server hardware, SANs, and datacenter design & rebuild. As part of those roles I have designed, implemented and written many back end processes to support the State of Nebraska - DHHS IT department. These processes include a server build process, many MVC webpages to support help desk tasks,and a number of ETL processes for data synchronization between disparate systems. Currently, I''m in on the development side of the Microsoft stack doing C# development with Sitecore & MVC working with a team of extremely talented, creative, and driven people in the advertising sector. I love large scale IT projects and the day to day challenges and inspiration that come with working on a team of focused and talented people who really enjoy the work they do.'
