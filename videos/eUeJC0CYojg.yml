title: 'Why Software Enables the Energy Revolution'
recordingDate: 1530788128
description: "Energy is an essential part of everybody’s life. Without energy, no smartphone would work. No website would load. And no fancy car would drive. Energy is the key to our society as we know it. But in certain eras we do not utilise our possibilities and leave a lot of potential unused. Peter Blaschek explains how, with new technology approaching the end customers, the last mile for the energy revolution is going to be Software. The digital approach to combine all available resources and form an environment that allows a green footprint, energy autonomy and even the opportunity to monetise unused capacities.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
