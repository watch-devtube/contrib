description: "Watson has come a long way since the Jeopardy! win in 2011 and the journey continues. As IBM has emerged as a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company, Watson has evolved into the cognitive platform for IBM. In the early days of Watson, many of our solutions were both on-premise and monolithic in nature. This had to change. We've embarked on a journey towards a more nimble microservice architecture with a continuous delivery model. We would like to share with you a microcosm of our journey in the evolution of NLP (Natural Language Processing) microservices and applying them to Healthcare. What problems have we solved? What benefits have we seen? What are the challenges ahead?\n\nWe will demonstrate an analytic NLP Pipeline, with ability to define sequential or asynchronous analytic flows, and the ability to configure the behavior of an analytic, the NLP pipeline service is a key component of our adaptable NLP service strategy within Watson Health.\n\nWe will work our way from NLP microservices to their use in our Watson for Oncology offering, demonstrating the pluggable architecture we have built for Watson Health\n\nPlease join us and connect with us at the conference.\n\nSandhya Kapoor \nIBM has been my home since 1990. Over the years I have been a part of some incredible technology application projects that led to my start with Watson in 2010. Since Watson’s commercial success, I have been around the world talking to an entire global developer community and some of the largest companies on the planet about developing cutting edge technology and how to duplicate our efforts for specific uses in their industries.\n\nI’ve dedicated the last seven years to building the artificial intelligence and deep learning circuitry, and have recently been involved with the development of a similar platform to serve the healthcare industry.\n\nScott Carrier \nScott is Squad Leader for the Watson Health Annotator for Clinical Data (ACD) Service. A 15-year veteran of IBM, Scott joined the Watson Group back in December of 2011. Prior to his work in Watson Health services, Scott was NLP Lead for client solutions. Scott was recently designated an IBM Master Inventor with several patents to his name in the cognitive computing space. Last but not least, Scott is a proud father of two awesome kids with a third on the way and loves getting them excited about technology.\n\nMike Wilcox \nMike is currently a member of the Watson Health technical architecture team. This ‘senior level’ team has the mission to drive a common architecture across the umbrella of Watson Healthcare solutions and acquisitions, while supporting agile software development. Mike has focused on PaaS, ‘big data’ analytics, API Management, DevOps automation, 'high availability' infrastructural design and Healthcare terminology. Mike also has been a technical member evaluating acquisition candidates for Watson Health.\n\nAfter obtaining a Master's in Electrical Engineering, Mike gained his IT experience by designing and customizing IT solutions for some of largest corporations in the US during some of the fastest growing periods in IT history.\n\nMike has shared his technical knowledge via mentoring, chalk talks and speaking engagements to clients across the USA as well as in France, Ireland, Portugal, Australia and Austria."
