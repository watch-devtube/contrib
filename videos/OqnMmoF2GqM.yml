language: English
recordingDate: 1353946524
description: "With the upcoming release of IE10 you may be curious how much performance you can expect from JavaScript in IE. In this talk I'll delve deep into the internals of Chakra (including changes added in IE10), its profiling interpreter, type system, optimizing compiler, and garbage collector. If you enjoy staring at assembly code, there will be plenty of that as well.\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
