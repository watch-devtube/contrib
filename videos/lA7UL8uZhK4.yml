description: "Laurent Gasser\nFounder & CEO\n\nSHARING A SUCCESS STORY: A LOW COST, CUSTOMER DRIVE AND CO-DEVELOPED ANDROID EMM\nIn 2017, Wizy developed the first Cloud SaaS EMM built natively on Android Enterprise.\nDuring this presentation, you will discover how WizyEMM was built from scratch, in 1 year, on Android Enterprise and the Google Cloud Platform. We will share with you the lessons learned during this once in a lifetime experience as well as the technical challenges we faced. You’ll get an insight on the best practices to successfully deploy an EMM in 1 month on a fleet of 6.000 Zebra Android devices for a leading European Courier Company.\n\nFinally we’ll share our vision on 2 major topics: 1/ Why Android Enterprise is bringing a disruptive change to the EMM market 2/ Why new vertical Android only solutions, like WizyEMM, are a real alternative to existing “one fits all” EMM solutions."
