description: "In this talk from JaxConf 2012, Abdelmonaim Remani answers many common questions surrounding NoSQL.\n\nThe rise of NoSQL is characterized with confusion and ambiguity; very much like any fast-emerging organic movement in the absence of well-defined standards and adequate software solutions. Whether you are a developer or an architect, many questions come to mind when faced with the decision of where your data should be stored and how it should be managed. This talk will address many of these questions, as well as survey the most popular NoSQL technologies.\n\n** For more presentations from JaxConf 2012, head to http://mrkn.co/txtch"
