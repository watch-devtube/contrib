title: 'OSCON 2011:  Jim Zemlin, "2011: The Bizarro World of Computing"'
recordingDate: 1311912039
description: "On the eve of Linux' 20th anniversary, Jim Zemlin invites the OSCON audience into his \"Bizarro World\" of 2011. The world of computing has been turned upside down. Microsoft's stock is down. They now are filing anti-trust suits, not being the subject of them. Heck, Microsoft is even contributing code to Linux. And for good reason: Linux is dominating in almost every tech sector, and collaborative development is being applied to nearly every industry and culture around the globe. Linus attends the Oscars? An open source mobile OS is growing faster than Apple's? What world is this? One in which open source has won? Or have we? What are the challenges facing a movement that is part economic, part political and part art? How will the patent landscape affect this movement? Jim will explain that there is a new innovation burden now being placed on the open source community to be a leader instead of fast follower.\n\nJim Zemlin\n\nThe Linux Foundation\n\nZemlin's career spans three of the largest technology trends to rise over the last decade: mobile computing, SaaS and open source software. Today, as executive director of The Linux Foundation, he uses this experience to accelerate the adoption of Linux and support the future of computing.\n\nZemlin's career took root at Western Wireless, which had a successful IPO and was later acquired by Deutsche Telekom and renamed T-Mobile USA. He was also a member of the founding management team of Corio, a leading enterprise application service provider that had a successful IPO in July 2000. Other posts have included vice president of marketing at Covalent Technologies and executive director at Free Standards Group (FSG).\n\nIn his leadership role today at The Linux Foundation, Zemlin works with the world's largest technology companies, including IBM, Intel, Google, HP, Nokia, and others to help define the future of computing on the server, in the cloud and on a variety of new mobile computing devices. His work at the vendor-neutral Linux Foundation gives him a unique and aggregate perspective on the global technology industry.\n\nZemlin is a regular keynote speaker at industry events such as COMPUTEX, LinuxCon, Gartner's Open Source Conference and Open Mobile Summit, among others. Zemlin advises a variety of startups, including DeviceVM, and sits on the boards of the Global Economic Symposium, Open Source For America and Chinese Open Source Promotion Union.
