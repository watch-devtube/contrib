description: "Think you need to write hundreds of lines of JavaScript code to achieve something useful in an APEX application? Think again! It often takes just a few lines of JavaScript to get the job done. Of course, to write any lines of JavaScript, you’ll need to understand some basic concepts. In this session, attendees will see several real JavaScript-based solutions that only require a few lines of code to implement. In each case, the concepts behind the code and the approach to solving the problem will be explained.\n\n\nA recording provided by the awesome APEX community, that built a virtual 24 hour conference called APEX@Home held on April 16th 2019.\n\nWith 24 world renowned speakers and nearly 5000 virtual attendees, this event was a huge success.
