title: 'Hacking F# in JS ecosystem'

description: "by Krzysztof Cieslak\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.3.201/dotnet_fsharp_js_ecosystem.webm\n\n\nJavascript has conquered the world - developers can use it in the browser, on the server, to write mobile apps, on the desktop with Electron, and even to create serverless services. Like the language or not, the truth is JS developers have built an incredible ecosystem with libraries and tools to do almost anything. During the talk I'll show how to bring the power of F# - the functional paradigm, static typing with type inference, pattern matching, and more modern language features - to this huge and rich JS world using Fable - F# to JS compiler. Fable doesn't add any runtime overhead and generates clean JS code in conformance with new ES6 patterns, like modules or iterables, making it compatible with modern development tools, including Github Electron or React Native to let you develop not only web, but also cross platform desktop and mobile apps. I'll demonstrate how to create different types of JS applications using F# - from React-based frontend application, through mobile app using React Native to serverless services. \n\nRoom: K.3.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 12:00:00+01"
