title: 'DEF CON 26 - Wesley McGrew - An Attacker Looks at Docker Approaching Multi Container Applications'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540249664
description: "Containerization, such as that provided by Docker, is becoming very popular among developers of large-scale applications. The good news: this is likely to make your life easier as an attacker. \n\nWhile exploitation and manipulation of traditional monolithic applications might require specialized experience and training in the target languages and execution environment, applications made up of services distributed among multiple containers can be effectively explored and exploited \"from within\" using many of the system- and network-level techniques that attackers, such as penetration testers, already know. \n\nThe goal of this talk is to provide a hacker experienced in exploitation and post-exploitation of networks and systems with an exposure to containerization and the implications it has on offensive operations. Docker is used as a concrete example for the case study. A hacker can expect to leave this presentation with a practical exposure to multi-container application post-exploitation."
