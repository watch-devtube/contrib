title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: The future of Monitoring is now with Sensu'
recordingDate: 1493214568
description: "If something is going to go down it’s important to know as soon as it does. It’s even better if you can catch it before it goes down (or at least before anyone notices). Anyone that has ever setup or maintained a Nagios setup probably thinks that monitoring is a dull duty for sad people, but it’s not anymore!\n\nSensu is an amazingly flexible and hackable tool that was built for modern cloud architectures and for easy use with configuration management systems. We’ll look at how sensu is architected and how it removes the pain wrought by it’s predecessors. We’ll review writing simple plugins to monitor your own services and how you can connect sensu to a graphing service like\_graphite\_or\_influxdb\_and\_graphana\_to monitor the same metrics you are using for alerting.\n\nSensu is written in ruby but plugins can be written in any language. Examples will be provided in PHP for the convenience of Drupal developers in the audience. We will show you how to use and extend the\_check module\_to monitor your Drupal instances and\_a\_working Vagrant project\_will be provided for ease of setup and evaluation."
