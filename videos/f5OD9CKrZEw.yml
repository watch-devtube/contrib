In this series I will cover everything there is to know about Java algorithms and data structures.\n\nAn algorithm is just the steps you take to manipulate data. A data structure is the way data is arranged in memory. There are 3 main data structure operations I will focus on first being inserting, deleting and searching for data.\n\nLike all of my tutorials, everything is simple at first and then I cover more complex topics."
