description: "Almost everyone uses docker, but without really knowing what it is or does under the hood. To be fair, it just works and the whole thing with namespaces and images is a dry topic.\n\nThe most important thing to know is, docker is just a product name for a program that uses several already long-existing technologies to create its containers. Well, it's a little bit more, since it provides the docker hub infrastructure, a vital part of docker's success.\nSince understanding docker means understanding the underlying principles, you will see how to create your own container without using anything docker.\n\nTo do this a small program is written in golang (you don't need to know the language) that creates a real container. During this process, you will get to know and, most importantly, understand how docker works. Why would you want to know how Docker works internally?\nIf you know the concept by heart, working with docker and especially debugging weird stuff it does from time to time becomes a breeze.\n?Additionally to the things above you will get deeper knowledge about images, the second most important thing apart from containers.\n\nThe talk is aimed at programmers who struggle to understand docker or just want to know more about a technology they use every day.\n\nEVENT:\n\nDutch PHP Conference in 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nNiklas Dzösch\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H__eF6hvWg"
