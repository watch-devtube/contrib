title: 'A New Approach to Design of Massively Parallel Systems'
recordingDate: 1218795925
description: "Google Tech Talks\nAugust 13, 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nBased on insights derived from theory of global optimization, we have made a major breakthrough in physical design of several massively parallel systems. These include:\n\nNew design of parallel supercomputers based on massively parallel quantum tunneling, electron optics and finite projective geometry. This approach overcomes the bandwidth and latency obstacle faced by other contemporary designs. Other advantages include large improvement in teraflops per kilowatt, significant reduction in programming complexity and broad applicability to many domains, including those requiring a lot of pointer chasing. Our design can be implemented using known fabrication techniques.\n\nNew design of low latency, multi-ported secondary storage based on magneto-optics that implements shared memory directly at physical level.  This feature is highly valuable to business data bases as well as applications requiring frequent shared access to massive amounts of common data such as google earth.\n \nNew design of high bandwidth switches required for building next generation internet infrastructure.\n\nSpeaker: Narendra Karmarkar\nDr. Karmarkar received his B.Tech at the IIT Bombay in 1978. Later, he received his M.S. at the California Institute of Technology, and his Ph.D. at the Institute of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nHe published his famous result in 1984 while he was working for Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. Karmarkar was a professor at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay. \n\nKarmarkar received a number of awards for his algorithm, including the Fulkerson Prize and the Lanchester Prize."
