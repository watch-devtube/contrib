description: "Google Tech Talks\nAugust, 18 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMatt dances badly on the internet and he is quasi-famous for it.\n\nWant to learn more about traveling the world, getting someone else to pay for it, bad dancing, and becoming a YouTube sensation? \n\nCome hear Matt talk about his adventures or read/see more at www.wherethehellismatt.com.\n\n    Where the Hell is Matt? (2008) from Matthew Harding on Vimeo.\n\nSpeaker: Matt Harding\nMatt lives in Seattle, Washington with his girlfriend, Melissa, and dog, Sydney. He hasn't had a real job since Stride called him up. Matt doesn't mind working, but he doesn't much care for having to show up at the same place every day.\n\nMatt is not rich. Matt also doesn't have some magical secret for traveling cheaply. He does it pretty much the same way everybody else does.\n\nMatt thinks Americans need to travel abroad more.\n\nMatt was a very poor student and never went to college. When he got older, he was pleased to discover that no one actually cares. Matt doesn't want to imply that college is bad or anything. He's just saying is all. There's other ways to fill your head.\n\nMatt is left-handed.\n\nWhen Matt was younger, he could hang seven spoons on his face at once. Sadly, puberty made Matt's face less conducive to spoon-hanging.\n\nMatt's Xbox Live screen name is BadDancer. He plays a lot of Rock Band.\n\nMatt has a little piece of extra cartilage sticking out on the rim of one ear and a little hole in the same place on the other ear. Since saying so on this page, he's been informed that the extra piece of cartilage is called a Darwinian Tubercle. Matt thinks this is pretty much the greatest name for anything ever.\n\nMatt has never lost a staring contest."
