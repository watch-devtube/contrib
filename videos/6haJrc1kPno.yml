recordingDate: 1543795172
description: "In the past few years, React and Redux have generated a surge of Functional and Declarative Programming which we often take for granted. However many of us never got a chance to learn the fundamentals. \n\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss the fundamentals of Functional Programming and how they apply to modern JavaScript. We’ll cover immutability, separation of concerns, and composability. We’ll avoid unnecessary jargon like monads and functors and stick to concepts that will make our code better. \n\nMatthew is a software engineer at Dropbox. He has worked on everything across the stack from deploying containers and databases to shipping Javascript. In recent history, Matthew has been focused on frontend tooling and organizes an internal community at Dropbox called the JS Guild. When he's not writing code, Matthew enjoys Harry Potter, Green Day, and Broadway shows.\n\nEVENT:\n\nReactNext 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMatthew Gerstman\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nReactNext Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
