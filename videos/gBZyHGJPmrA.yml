recordingDate: 1308683130
description: "Google Tech Talk (more info below)\r\nJune 8, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Hanno Sander.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"students learn by doing\" is especially true in today's world. Bringing robots into the classroom lets kids \"do\" science, technology, engineering, math- and much more. Besides learning mathematical and computational ideas, students also learn to work together, think creatively and solve problems. Robots engage kids by providing real world interaction that they can control, create and customize. Robots bridge the gap between hands-on activities and abstract concepts typically found in technical curricula. Today's wide range and low cost of sensors, actuators and microcontrollers coupled with easy to learn visual programming languages enable students to explore advanced concepts. This talk will focus on how robots are being used in New Zealand education to stimulate innovation and develop tomorrow's workforce. This talk is geared to kids of all ages- with plenty of real-life robot action!"
