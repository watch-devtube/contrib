recordingDate: 1550008800
description: "The Importance of Laughter\n\nIn software development, we strive for inspection and adaptation. In order to make the best of this, we have to feel good about ourselves and with each other. Fun and laughter is something I have always tried to enhance in the places where I work, but only recently have I started looking into why it is helpful.\nDiving into this subject, I was amazed by how big an impact fun and laughter can have on your social life, your wellbeing, and your energy levels. Join me for a session with brain research, examples of fun, and case studies from real life. Bring an open mind and leave with knowledge about why you should have fun every day.\n\nAino Corry is a teacher, a technical conference editor and retrospectives facilitator. She holds a masters degree and a ph.d. in computer science. She has 12 years of experience with Patterns in Software Development, and teaches retrospectives, OO design, software architecture and development in academia and industry. She also teaches how to teach Computer Science to teachers, and thus lives up to the name of her company; Metadeveloper. In her spare time, she runs and sings (but not at the same time).\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
