description: "Functional programming is a great tool for enabling programmers to solve complex problems through the use of data and functions. However, not all data and functions are created equal, and some are less composable than others. Web libraries in particular are guilty of being overly opinionated and ending up as closed worlds of functionality. As programmers we are complicit whenever we find ourselves asking: “What web framework should I use”? But why do we need to choose a single framework in the first place? Why can’t we compose functions from different libraries? Do we really need 5 different ways to get/set a cookie?\n\nThis talk aims to deconstruct what we typically expect from a web framework, and how we can achieve the same functionality with a series of small, composable functions. This will be demonstrated using Haskell’s WAI library as a common building block, and contrasted to the equivalent implementation in other modern Haskell web frameworks. By the end of this talk web frameworks will be demystified and exposed for what they should be – a collection of composable functions. In addition the audience will have gained confidence in their ability to recognise good and bad functions, and to better evaluate the cost of the libraries they inhabit.\n\nCharles O'Farrell cares about correct and reliable software, and is still learning about it every day.\n\nFor more on YOW!
