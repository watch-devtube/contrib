description: 'n this live coding session in Scala, Kfir Bloch (head of back-end engineering at Wix) will showcase how to build a full-blown feature in Scala, while maintaining the principles of TDD and Clean Code. We''ll start with some simple scaffolding and build the feature in its entirety: defining the user-facing API, writing tests outside-in with all of the requisite building blocks (collaborators and matchers), development-refactoring cycles and ending up with a clean codebase.'
