description: 'I’d like to recap the history of JSConf and all the events it helped spawn since its inception by Chris and Laura in 2009. I plan to solicit quotes and soundbites from JSConfs & Family-events around the work that reflect on the influence of JSConf US and the subsequent success of the local conferences. Expect teary moments.'
