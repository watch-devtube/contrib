description: "Google I/O 2009 - Beyond Cut & Paste: Deep integrations with Google Friend Connect\r\n\r\nArne Roomann-Kurrik, Patrick Chanezon, Chris Schalk\r\n\r\nWith Google Friend Connect, hosting a couple files and dropping in some JavaScript is all it takes to instantly awaken the community that visits your site -- but there's so much more! In this session we'll show you how to use Friend Connect as a login provider for a website with an existing accounts infrastructure, and how to extend your existing data models with social data.  With Friend Connect, you can keep your visitors more deeply engaged with your site and with each other.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
