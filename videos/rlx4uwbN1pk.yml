Everybody is trying to make their presence felt in the sphere. And one of the prime use cases of VR is shared spaces.\nIt opens up possibility of having shared earning space, meeting space and even training space in real-time and in an interactive way.\nHowever often these kind of experiences are mired with privacy concerns, who is hosting the space, the data retained and who is observing the behaviors. On top the data retention implications.\n\n\nWhat if we could build Virtual Reality experiences right on the browser using JavaScript and all the shared room logic too in an open auditable way. And what if we could host it in decentralized way.
