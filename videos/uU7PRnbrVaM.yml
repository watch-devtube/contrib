description: 'Isaac Newton, the father of modern software engineering, called it “Standing on the shoulders of giants”. Modern development is exciting as it gets easier and easier, partly because of the wealth of resources available at our fingertips. One category of these resources are libraries, SDKs, and frameworks. This talk will be a guide into the considerations that go into building a library for both iOS/Swift and Java/Android. We will be taking cues from both my personal experience, as well as from studying how the leaders in the field do it.'
