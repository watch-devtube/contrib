The locking strategy employs MRLock, which is a novel shared-memory resource allocation lock for multi-core processors. It uses a lock-free FIFO queue to manage locking requests in batches, which minimizes memory contention among threads. It is fast and designed as a drop-in replacement for the two-phase locking methods in C++11 and Boost library (std::lock() and boost::lock()). When combined with existing lock-based transaction synchronization techniques such as semantic locking and transaction boosting, it can be used by programmers who prefer lock-based code to implement high-performance transactional data structures on familiar grounds. The lock-free strategy is based on lock-free transactional transformation (LFTT), which uses transaction descriptor object to announce the transaction globally so that delayed threads can be helped. It is applicable to linked data structures such as linked lists and skip lists. The logical status of any node in the data structure depends on the status of the transaction descriptor that was embedded in it. Conflict transactions do not need to revert their operations as required in some of the existing methodologies. We will demonstrate the application of this strategy to existing lock-free lists and skip lists. \n\nWe will also introduce a lock-free logarithmic search data structure based on multi-dimensional linked list. This brand new data structure is designed from ground up to achieve full potential for concurrent accesses. It has a distributed memory layout which alleviates contention. Write operations modify at most two nodes so interference among operations are brought down to a minimum. This data structure implements the collection/dictionary abstract data type, which is ubiquitous in modern applications. When combined with the above mentioned transactional strategies, this work could greatly benefit application developers who deal with data intensive scenarios such as in memory databases.\n\n\nPreliminary version of source code can be accessed from https://ucf-cs.github.io/tlds/.
