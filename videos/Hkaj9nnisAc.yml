description: "Join us for a FREE Webinar : http://www.edureka.co/android-development-certification-course\n\nThis android tutorial talks about Activity in detail:\n\nActivity Life-cycle:\n-------------------------\n\nAn activity is a single screen that can be shown to user. \nAlmost all activities interact with the user, so there Activity class takes care of creating a window for you in which you can place your UI. \n\n*Foreground activity is considered the most important.\n\n*Partially visible activity is also considered very important, however the code execution stops whenever it is covered by any other component/activity \n\n*Background activity is no longer critical, so the system may safely kill its process to reclaim memory for other foreground or visible processes. \n\nTo know more about Activity Life-cycle, please attend our renowned FREE webinar using this link - http://www.edureka.co/android\n\nPlease write back to us at support@edureka.in or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information. \nhttp://www.edureka.co\n\nUse the link to watch all videos of this session :\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ooVrP1hQOHiWL2R-gYcF8oA4yPJKTNb"
