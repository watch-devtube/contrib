title: 'YOW! 2012 Aaron Bedra - Ready Set Clojure!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513950250
description: "With Clojure on the rise it is time you learned how to properly wield your parens. Join Aaron as he walks you through building software with Clojure. You will walk through a real world example; building a library for working with Redis. Building beautiful abstractions on top of data has always been the lisp way, and this example will be no different. You will walk away with a better understanding of Clojure, interfacing with external services, and gain situational knowledge of when and how to use Clojure’s macros to help you produce more powerful abstractions.\n\nAaron is the creator of Repsheet, an open source threat intelligence framework. He is the co-author of Programming Clojure, 2nd Edition and a frequent open source contributor.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
