title: 'Lightweight C# with Omnisharp and C# scripting - Filip W'
recordingDate: 1484914256
description: "For years, due to the nature of C# projects, C# developers were confined to Visual Studio as their only IDE, and Windows as their only development OS.\nRecently, community-driven initiatives such as OmniSharp or scriptcs, have helped developers shrug off the Visual Studio chains, and liberate themselves to develop lightweight C# in any editor, on any platform. In this talk we'll explore them and learn how you could use C# for lightweight development."
