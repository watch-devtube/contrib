description: "The 11th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering\r\nMountain View, California, USA\r\nSeptember 19-22, 2011\r\n\r\nBuilding Table Formatting Tools\r\nMihai Bilauca, Patrick Healy\r\n\r\nPresented by Mihai Bilauca.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nIn this paper we present an overview of the challenges to overcome when developing table authoring tools, including a review of logical table models, typographical issues and automated table layout optimization. We present a Table Drawing Tool prototype which implements an automated solution for the table layout optimization problem for tables with spanning cells using a mathematical modelling method. We report on the performance improvements of this new optimization method compared to previous solutions."
