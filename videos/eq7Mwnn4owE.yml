description: "Heather Wilde (ROCeteer): Choice is Overrated - Designing Products That Know What You Want Before You Do\n\nDid you know that the average person makes 35,000 decisions a day?\n\nNetflix. Amazon. Siri. Google Now. Nest. Soli.\n\nAnticipatory Design is the next big leap in both Experience-as Interaction Design (design that’s one step ahead of you), and these companies are ahead of the curve.\n\nAccording to CEO Aaron Shapiro, the next big breakthrough in design and technology will be the creation of products, services, and experiences that eliminate the needless choices from our lives and make ones on our behalf, freeing us up for the ones we really care about: \"Anticipatory design\". Rather than traditional UI/UX, where the tendency is to provide options in a participatory manner to determine a result, here you remove all choices from the user, and use predictive modeling to give an outcome to liberate them from so-called “decision fatigue,” “Flow not friction,” “convenience not choice,” and “efficiency not freedom” are the mantras of anticipatory design.\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore the implementations of anticipatory design by the best in the business, discuss areas where it is done well, and issues with the overall movement.\n\nThe speech was given on 2017-05-17 at infoShare 2017 (Inspire Stage) in Gdańsk.\nhttp://infoshare.pl\n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
