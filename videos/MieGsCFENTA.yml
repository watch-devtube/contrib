title: 'Wiring the Internet of Things with Node RED'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540826671
description: "Node-RED is an open-source visual tool for wiring the Internet of Things. Built on top of Node.js, it provides a light-weight, browser-based editor that makes it easy to integrate different streams of both physical and digital events. \n\nIt is ideal to run at the edge of the network, such as on a Raspberry Pi, but also within the cloud. It provides a framework for adding new nodes to its palette, extending its capabilities. Originally developed by IBM team, it is now a project of the JS Foundation. \n\nThe project has recently introduced version control directly within the editor allowing it to integrate closely with a developer's regular workflow. This talk will introduce Node-RED and show how it can become an invaluable tool for creating IoT solutions. \n\nThe talk will demonstrate a complete developer workflow from development to production with an application that deploys across devices.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode+JS Interactive 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nNick O'Leary, IBM\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nNodeJS YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQPYJluYC_sn_Qz_XE-YbTQ"
