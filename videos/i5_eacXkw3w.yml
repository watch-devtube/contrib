description: "Lightning Talk: Debugging microservices applications with Envoy + Squash - Idit Levine, Solo.io\_\n\nThe mainstreaming of containerization and microservices is raising a critical question by both developers and operators: how do we debug all this?\n\nDebugging microservices applications is a difficult task. The state of the application is spread across multiple microservices, and it is hard to get a holistic view of the state of the application. To meet this challenge we developed Squash, the microservices debugger. Squash integrates with Envoy to attach a debugger to any application in the service mesh. \n\nIn this talk, we will describe the Envoy filters we wrote to integrate with Squash to facilitate distributed debugging."
