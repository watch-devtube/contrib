recordingDate: 1510747847
description: "Kotlin/Native compiles Kotlin to standalone binaries for many targets (including Linux, macOS and iOS) using LLVM.\n\nIn this talk we will examine the internals of a Kotlin/Native Spinner application (demoed in the Keynote) and see how the technology works on the server, mobile clients and even WebAssembly. We'll also cover some details about the future for Kotlin/Native.\n\nAndrey Breslav has been leading design and development of the Kotlin Programming Language at JetBrains since 2010 when the project started. He often presents as a speaker at large software conferences and contributes to the Kotlin blog."
