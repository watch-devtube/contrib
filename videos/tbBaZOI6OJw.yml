description: "Demo with Julz Friedman, Product Manager, Software Engineer, IBM\n\nAbout Julz Friedman\nJulian Friedman (julz) is an IBMer and the project lead for Cloud Foundy's low-level container engine (\"Garden\") and the Application Autoscaler component. Over a long career he has worked on early cloud environments, Map/Reduce, performance optimisation for AI systems and, of course, most currently and importantly, building container engines for fantastic multi-tenant platforms as a service. If you have several free hours and enjoy the sound of a rant delivered in a British accent, ask him whether he thinks pushing mongodb to a cloud platform is a good idea."
