description: "Like it or not – IT is a quick fix fashion industry. We are constantly looking to be on the cutting edge of technology and management practices. New fashion trends and buzzwords come and go and none of them seem to be the silver bullet that we so desperately need. Yet there is one book so full of mind blowing concepts that you will be amazed. Further more, I bet a lot of you have read that book.\n\nNow that you are hooked – I will talk about mentoring, data analysis, why the death of agility is a big exaggeration, and… literature.\n\nThis is an inspirational talk that will hopefully make you look at your everyday work life in a slightly different way."
