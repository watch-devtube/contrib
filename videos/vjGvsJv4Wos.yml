description: "Filmed at http://2016.dotswift.io on January 29th in Paris. More talks on http://thedotpost.com\n\nWith Swift in the open, we can see what is coming for the language. Better built-in support for asynchronous programming is not one of them, yet. In this talk, we'll look at how Futures can help you write better asynchronous code now and what Futures could look like if they would be added to the language."
