description: "Life in the early days of the web was hard. One day your HTML is disintegrating, the next you are fighting someone named “~Ninjad00d~“ who has found a way to take over your forum system. Lessons in security in these days were hard learned.\n\nThese are the true stories from the early days of the web and how forums, chat rooms and online games were turned upside down for fun and profit. If you stick around after laughing at the misfortune of online pioneers, there will also be lessons about finding your way in a world that wants to exploit your every mistake.\n\nOMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
