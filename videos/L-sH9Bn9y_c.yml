description: 'Grails is one of the most flexible and most powerful frameworks on The Java Platform. Grails leverages the flexibility offered by the platform in a way that other web frameworks do not. Grails is a fantastic platform for polglot web programming. Part of what makes Grails so compelling is its really powerful plugin system. The Grails plugin system allows capabilities to be bolted on to applications, including adding support for a variety of programming languages. All of the major programming languages available on the JVM are supported by The Grails Framework. These include Java, Groovy, Scala, Clojure and others. This session will dive in to that aspect of the framework with a focus on Scala and Clojure and will demonstrate what is involved in adding support for new languages.'
