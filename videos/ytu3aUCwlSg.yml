description: "Keynote: Developing Kubernetes Services at Airbnb Scale - Melanie Cebula, Software Engineer, Airbnb \n\nYou've already made the plunge to move to Kubernetes, and you feel pretty good about that. But why does it feel like it requires expert-level Kubernetes knowledge for engineers to get anything done? This talk will identify key problems that make out-of-the-box Kubernetes less friendly to developers, and strategies for addressing them, based on Airbnb’s experience empowering one thousand engineers to develop hundreds of Kubernetes services at scale. This talk will focus primarily on four problem areas:\n1. Configuration: Generated and templated configuration, extracting shareable components and containers\n2. CI/CD: Containerizing CI/CD, multi-stage builds, deploy strategies\n3. Service lifecycle: Primary and sidecar containers, Advanced pod readiness, warmup, graceful termination, etc\n4. Tooling: Creating and Distributing a kubectl wrapper \n\nTo learn more: https://sched.co/GsxY"
