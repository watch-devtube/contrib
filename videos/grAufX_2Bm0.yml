description: "TDD as in Type Driven Development is a new beast on the block. Get a glimpse of what it can do and what it is like to develop types-first. Understand the cycle of Type-Define-Refine. Similarities between TestDD and TypeDD.\n\nTraditionally strongly typed languages has had a very obnoxious compiler that punishes every little developer mistake with marginally helpful error message. Thanks to Idris this has totally changed. Idris uses the power of the compiler to help you get it to compile by suggesting solutions(!), by letting you partially define the program, and by making the type information as visible to you as possible.\n\nDid statically typed languages just become more powerful and easier?"
