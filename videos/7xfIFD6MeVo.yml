description: "Swift has now been around for almost two years, and the language has evolved. What hasn't changed are the APIs in Apple's SDK you work with every day. As much as you want to embrace Swift, you still must understand the SDK conventions, many of which originated in the Cocoa era. Continuing to write Swift like Objective-C is not ideal or sustainable. Michele Titolo looks at existing patterns and how to make them more friendly in Swift.\n\nwww.istanbultechtalks.com"
