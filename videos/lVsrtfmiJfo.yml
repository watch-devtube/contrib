description: "by James Shubin\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.114/containers_mgmt.webm\n\n\nMgmt is a next gen config management tool that takes a fresh look at existing automation problems.\nThe tool has two main parts: the engine, and the language.\nThe engine has a number of resources, including a container resource.\nWe will feature a number of demos of this resource, and discuss how the language can be used to build a custom container automation solution.\nThe language is a minimalistic, functional, reactive DSL.\nIt can be used to build a real-time, distributed container automation solution, or something else entirely!\nWe'll also use it to demo, service discovery, auto-scaling, and scheduling!\nFinally we'll talk about some of the future designs we're planning and make it easy for new users to get involved and help shape the project. \n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 12:15:00+01"
