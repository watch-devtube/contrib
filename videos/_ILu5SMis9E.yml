description: "Google TechTalks\nFebruary 28, 2006\n\nProf. Bob Brodersen\n\nABSTRACT:  The ability of FPGA technology to exploit the advances in IC fabrication technology has resulted in the present situation in which a FPGA computing fabric is the most power and area efficient approach for general purpose parallel computing. This has occurred because the Von-Neumann processor architectures are now power limited and can no longer fully exploit the technology advances (thus the move to multi-cores). Hardware composed of arrays of FPGA's and memory has been design that achieves a TeraOp/second of performance per board with over an order of magnitude higher efficiency for the computation per unit power over conventional..."
