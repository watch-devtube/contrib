description: "Now that we have JavaFX on the desktop with all the nice features such as effects and animations, the question is how we can benefit from that. Unfortunately, neither are all developers graphic designers nor is every company able to pay for a designer. So additional skills are needed, and this session provides practical advice on how to use the visual effects in JavaFX to create good-looking controls and user interfaces. It shows tips and tricks a controls developer should know in order to create nice-looking visual components. It also covers gradients and what you can do with them, writable images and how to use them effectively, tricks with shadows, how to benefit from using the Canvas node, converting graphics to code, and more.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nGerrit Grunwald\nGerrit Grunwald is working as a software engineer at Canoo Engineering AG (Basel, Switzerland).
