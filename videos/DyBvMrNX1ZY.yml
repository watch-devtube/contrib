description: "Real World Docker for the Rubyist by Jason Clark\n\nDocker’s gotten a lot of press, but how does it fare in the real world Rubyists inhabit every day?\n\nTogether we’ll take a deep dive into how a real company transformed itself to run on Docker. We’ll see how to build and maintain Docker images tailored for Ruby. We’ll dig into proper configuration and deployment options for containerized applications. Along the way we’ll highlight the pitfalls, bugs and gotchas that come with such a young, fast moving platform like Docker.\n\nWhether you’re in production with Docker or just dabbling, come learn how Docker and Ruby make an awesome combination.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Jdj1/"
