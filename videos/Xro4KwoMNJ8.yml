description: "Heinz Kabutz, CIO / CTO, JavaSpecialists.EU\n\nEvery major Java version introduces a new and better way of managing state. Java 7 gave us Phaser as a replacement for CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier. Hardly any programmers know how it works, even though we are now on Java 11. Java 8 gave us StampedLock, useful as a lighter read “lock” for building concurrent classes. Again not very widely known, but lots of use cases. Java 9/10/11 introduced VarHandle as an escape for Unsafe addicts. This session shows all three concepts and explains when each should be used."
