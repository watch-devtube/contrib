description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nProminent members of the C++ community are advocating the \"almost-always-auto\" idiom, but there are understandable concerns from many about its implications. This case study will demonstrate how it may be applied in different situations, suggest ways to avoid performance penalties, introduce algorithms to minimize the \"almost\" part, and discuss the overall impact.\n— \nAndy Bond\nLead Software Engineer, Blizzard Entertainment\nI've been programming professionally at Blizzard for over 16 years and am currently a Lead Software Engineer for Heroes of the Storm. While my day-to-day focus is on providing the best gameplay experience for our players, in my spare time I enjoy tinkering with the latest C++ features to discover better ways to implement whatever our designers dream up next.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
