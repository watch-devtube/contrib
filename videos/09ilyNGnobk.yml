The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects - Learn more at https://kubecon.io\n\nKeynote: Keeping Your Data in Kubernetes with Vitess - Sugu Sougoumarane, CTO, PlanetScale \n\nAn increasing number of applications and workloads are being migrated to and are being built for Kubernetes. It has been sufficiently established that Kubernetes is the platform of the future. However, drilling down will reveal that the most successful of these workloads are stateless, and that the database/storage layers have mostly remained outside. This begs the question: What will it take to run everything in Kubernetes? What are the risks and benefits? In this respect, Vitess has a unique background. Due to the fact that it was built to run on Borg, it was ready for Kubernetes from day one. The best part of this is that many leading-edge adopters ran with Vitess very early on; this resulted in a diverse group of Vitess deployments on Kubernetes, from tiny Vitess installations all the way to JD’s colossal clusters. Organizations that have adopted this approach are reaping many unique benefits such as no vendor lock-in, unified management of infrastructure, and self-service based automations. We will cover all these use cases and go over the details of how these organizations benefited by going all in with Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/YWK3"
