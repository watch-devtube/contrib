title: 'Image Recognition with Deep Learning From prototype to production by Ben Vermeersch & Mario Van den'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510582787
description: "At Xplore Group, we developed a system to detect clothing characteristics from images, using Deep Learning with Neural Networks. In this talk, we'll tell you what we've learned along the way when developing this system. From the first training of our model, to developing something production-worthy. We also developed several front-end interfaces for this system. You will learn how we access a Kinect from the web, and interface with the image recognition system. This talk is intended for technical attendees, who are interested in using Deep Learning techniques in customer-facing applications. It will contain code examples in Java, Node.js, React and Python, so it's definitely a talk for developers with a broad interest.\n\n# Ben Vermeersch\nI've worked as a Java Developer ever since the start of my professional career, and have loved it ever since I first worked with it during my college years. I made the shift to developing Big Data related applications, mostly in Scala, a couple of years ago. My main focus today is designing and implementing Data Intensive architectures, and bridging the gap that exists between the more academic world of Data Science, and the traditional software development world.\n\n# Mario Van den Eynde\nI'm a web architect, music-lover and all-around tech-loving guy. Recently focussing on bridging the gap between the physical and the digital world using only web-related languages and techs."
