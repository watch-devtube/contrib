language: English
recordingDate: 1354224952
description: "HTML5 has delivered on the promise to make building mobile apps work seamlessly across devices and operating systems. But developers looking to build applications still have to code HTML, JavaScript and CSS by hand, often laboriously rebuilding features that exist in native platforms without the benefit of tooling that native platforms offer. In this webcast presentation we will discuss new tools in the HTML5 space, like Sencha Architect to make building mobile HTML5 apps as fun and easy as building native apps. \n\nAbout Aditya Bansod\n\nAditya is Sencha's VP of Product Management and is responsible for the product planning and strategy for Sencha's product lines. Prior to Sencha, Aditya held various senior product management roles at Adobe and Microsoft, focusing on developers and media in the mobile and consumer electronics space.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
