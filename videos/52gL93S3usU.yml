description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nWeb Exponents\r\npresented by Steve Souders\r\nMarch 5, 2009\r\n\r\nblog post: http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2009/03/steve-souders-lifes-too-short-write.html\r\n\r\nThis is the second talk based on Steve's next book, Even Faster Web Sites, the follows-up to High Performance Web Sites. The first talk presented three new best practices: Split the Initial Payload, Load Scripts Without Blocking, and Don't Scatter Inline Scripts.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these is loading external scripts without blocking other downloads and preventing page rendering. One complication is this may introduce undefined symbol errors if inlined code uses symbols from the external scripts. Luckily, there are several techniques to workaround this problem. That and other topics will be covered in this presentation of three more best practices:\r\n\r\n * Coupling Asynchronous Scripts\r\n * Use Iframes Sparingly\r\n * Flush the Document Early\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Steve Souders\r\nSteve Souders works at Google on web performance and open source initiatives, and previously served as the Chief Performance Yahoo!. He also co-founded Helix Systems and CoolSync, and worked at General Magic, WhoWhere?, and Lycos.
