description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nBrian Cantrill - VP of Engineering at Joyent\nDave Pacheco - Engineer at Joyent\n\nABSTRACT\nRecent years have seen new languages developed around explicit goals like performance or simplified programming models, but there's been little focus on the essential problem of debugging programs in production. We will discuss problems we've seen in deployed Node.js-based systems and demonstrate tools we have developed -- both postmortem and in situ -- that shine light into the darkness that is characteristic of modern JIT'd VMs in production.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
