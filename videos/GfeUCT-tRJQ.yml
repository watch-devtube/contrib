description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nJune 24, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nEclipse Day at the Googleplex\r\nWiring Hacker Synapses: Collaborative Coding and Team Tooling in Eclipse\r\nby Scott Lewis, Composent & Mustafa K. Isik\r\n\r\nECF is a communication framework and an increasing set of integrated tools. ECF provides APIs useful for the development of Equinox-based servers, RCP applications, and Eclipse-based development tools. The provider architecture supports the use of existing communications services, such as Google Talk and UI integration with web-based services, and other Eclipse-based tools. For example, for the upcoming Ganymede release, ECF is working on real-time shared editing of source code to support distributed team use cases like code reviews and collaborative debugging."
