description: "The dawn of the digital transformation has led to drastic changes and innovations when it comes to software development. Current systems design and deployment methodologies require new approaches in order for engineers to reason about running systems. What is required for today’s DevOps teams to achieve the level of observability they need for modern architectures such as cloud environments, microservices and containers? Additionally, what are the challenges, trends, and cultural changes for observability of modern architecture?\n\nIn this presentation, Humio’s Lead Customer Engineer, Grant Schofield, will discuss the historical and current trends in software development that have driven the modern approaches to reasoning about complex distributed systems, including the impact of innovative technology like time-series databases, and unique approaches to observability such as leveraging data to create actionable alerts in real-time and at scale, and managing increased complexities instantly."
