description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nData in the real world resembles a graph (nodes & edges) more than they do a table (column & rows). Graph exploration – also known as graph traversal – can be implemented by using igraph which is a collection of network analysis tools that can be programmed in Python, R, and C/C++. This talk will provide a survey of the amazing capabilities graph traversals provide to researchers.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
