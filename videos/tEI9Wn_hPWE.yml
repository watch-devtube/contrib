description: "Google Tech Talks\nDecember, 11 2007\n\nIn elections employing electronic voting machines, we have observed\nthat poor procedures, equipment failures, and honest mistakes pose a\nreal threat to the accuracy of the final tally. The event logs kept by\nthese machines can give auditors clues as to the causes of anomalies\nand inconsistencies; however, each voting machine is trusted to keep\nits own audit and ballot data, making the record unreliable. If a\nmachine is damaged, accidentally erased, or otherwise compromised\nduring the election, we have no way to detect tampering or loss of\nauditing records and cast votes.\n\nThis talk begins with our experiences in real elections where we have\nobserved these issues in the field, including a disputed primary\nelection in Laredo, Texas as well as the recent Congressional election\nin Sarasota, Florida. These issues motivate a new design for a voting\narchitecture we call \"VoteBox\" which networks the voting machines in a\npolling place, allowing for replicated, timeline-entangled logs which\ncan survive malice and malfunction to provide a verifiable audit of\nelection-day events.\n\nSpeaker: Dan Wallach\nDan Wallach is an associate professor in the Department of Computer\nScience at Rice University in Houston, Texas and is the associate\ndirector of NSF's ACCURATE (A Center for Correct, Usable, Reliable,\nAuditable and Transparent Elections).  His research involves computer\nsecurity and the issues of building secure and robust software systems\nfor the Internet.  He has testified about voting security issues\nbefore government bodies in the U.S., Mexico, and the European Union,\nhas served as an expert witness in a number of voting technology\nlawsuits, and recently participated in California's \"top-to-bottom\"\naudit of its voting systems."
