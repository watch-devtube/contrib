description: "Google I/O 2010 - Faster apps faster - Optimizing apps with the GWT Compiler \r\n\r\nGWT 201 \r\n\r\nRay Cromwell \r\n\r\nThe GWT compiler isn't just a Java to JavaScript transliterator. It performs many optimizations along the way. In this session, we'll show you not only the optimizations performed, but how you can get more out of the compiler itself. Learn how to speed up compiles, use -draftCompile, compile for only one locale/browser permutation, and more. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
