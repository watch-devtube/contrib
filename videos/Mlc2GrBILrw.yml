description: "Please use Google Moderator to ask questions: http://goo.gl/j1MYC\n\nThis week, we chat with the folks behind WeVideo. They're a cloud-based video editor, which lets users publish their final movie on YouTube. WeVideo's rendering farm prepares the complete movie from high-quality originals and uploads the final file to the user's YouTube channel using the Data API."
