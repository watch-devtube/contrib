description: "Further information: https://foss-backstage.de/session/untangling-spaghetti-when-and-how-split-projects\n\nWhen creating a new system that works with an established project, an important consideration is whether to make a new project or a subproject of the established\nproject. The considerations include:\n\n- How fast is the release cycle for the established project?\n- How tight is the integration with the established project?\n- Will the excitement of a new project bring more visibility?\n- Is the community separate from the established project?\n- Is the new project large enough to be self-sustaining?\n- Will tighter integration with the established project be helpful or cause difficulty for integrating with external projects.\n\nWe'll cover some of the cases that we made this decision and how they turned out:\n\n- Hadoop and RecordIO\n- Hadoop and Avro\n- Hive and Tez\n- Hive and ORC\n\nAfter making the decision, as the projects evolve the tradeoffs may change and\nneed to be revisited. Unfortunately we also have experience and have\npulled apart ORC from Hive and now the metastore from Hive. We'll cover the\ntechnical challenges and the governance challenges of splitting an existing project\ninto two projects."
