description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nA simple mechanism for tracking user location and finding others nearby is presented and contributed as open source. Geohashes expressed as integers padded with MSB=1 are used to store user location information with timestamps in Redis. An OTP application built on Mochiweb exposes a RESTful interface for setting user location information and finding neighboring users. If time permits, an integration with Mongoose may also be presented."
