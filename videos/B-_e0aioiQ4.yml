description: "In this talk we do some micro-benchmarking of various functional and procedural constructs in languages like Scala, Haskell, F#, D and C++. We analyze the impact of diverse programming styles, all in the functional genre, varying from pragmatic \"\"hidden mutation\"\" to highly monadic. We try to infer the overhead of particular constructs in a single programming language as well the alignment of those constructs with a given language. We also research the impact of constructs being used on the compilation time, which, in case of some languages, can become unacceptable.\nThe examples range from elementary like quicksort and heapsort to more complex like dictionaries and trees. Also, some common idioms like error handling and IO are being analysed.\nOn a side-note we also ask a deeper question - what is and what isn't functional programming and how its definition relates to the performance and correctness of programs."
