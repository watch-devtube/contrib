description: "Swift Workshop - Anton McConville, IBM\n\nMany of us are gracefully transitioning to Swift on the client, but now we can develop with Swift in the cloud too! Native iOS developers can become full stack engineers - in much the same way Front End JavaScript developers could with Node.js. \n\nIn this session we introduce Swift programming with Cloud Foundry. We load some open data, and surface it in a browser, exploring the syntax, opportunities and quirks of the Swift language. Leave the workshop with an understanding of how to do it yourself, and think about the possibilities of using Swift full stack within your projects."
