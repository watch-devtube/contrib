Around the world, legal practice is constrained and governed by different rules outlining who lawyers can represent, how they can interact with their clients, the nature of advice they can give, how they deal with conflicts of interest and what information they must keep confidential. This panel will talk about how legal ethics plays out specifically for free software. \n\nRoom: UA2.220 (Guillissen)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 13:30:00+01"
