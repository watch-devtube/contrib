description: "Intro: Release SIG - Tim Pepper, VMware & Aishwarya Sundar, Google \n\nYou could be a member of the Release Team. Yes, you! This interactive session will feature discussion with members of SIG Release's subproject release teams for 1.13 and 1.12. We will describe how Kubernetes project volunteers manage the quarterly release cadence of the project. We will give an overview of the release process and release team and how these combine across all of the kubernetes SIGs with the goal of producing high quality Kubernetes releases on a reliable schedule. And we will highlight the opportunities for both new and experienced community members (like you!) to get involved. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/Grbb"
