title: 'Christian Lilley: Build Scalable, Automated CSS - CSSConf.Asia 2014'
language: English
recordingDate: 1421481096
description: "Why don’t ’back-end’ coders get CSS?!? They call it an ’anti-language full of black magic’, and post GIFs making fun of our craft. Let’s kill two birds with one stone: learn how to evangelize CSS to them, and to make our CSS-Foo better and stronger by understanding both what makes them crazy, and what they bring to the table in terms of building scalable, maintainable applications. \nWe’ll take the bad with the good: purge from your own repertoire the habits (like over-use of floats) that never should have caught on. And acquire new habits (like naming conventions and preprocessors) that make your own code vastly more readable and maintainable. Finally, we’ll look at how automation with life-changing tools like Node, Grunt and Compass can not only grant you new super-powers, but also make your whole working style vastly more familiar to the server-side guys. By the end of our talk, you’ll be on a path to enlightenment, and the gear-heads down the hall will look at you in a whole new light.\n\nChristian is a UI Architect at McKinsey Digital Labs and turns theoretical business-y stuff into real useful blinky-lights. He digs rapid-prototyping with AngularJS, agile and co-founded the Data Visualization NY meetup. Now he lives in KL, whishing there was better GeoViz to find the best hawker stalls.\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Bridging Design and Implementation.
