description: "Collections are a staple in any programming language: the need to collect, sort or iterate over values is needed by nearly all developers.\n\nThe Java language introduced the Collections framework long ago and that's what many (incredibly not all!) developers learn when they start programming. It has plenty to offer, but many find it lacking: the amount of collection libraries as active open source projects demonstrate the need for something else.\n\nIf we were to search to find a holistic comparison of famous collection libraries, there is not much literature available. The talk is poised to fill this gap. In this session, we will explore the most common collections (pun intended!) frameworks, what they have to offer and what you should consider for your next project.\n\nWe will also show common programmer use cases, how each library handles them and the impact on memory, processing power and ease of use/coding.\n\nAfter this session, you will be able to choose the right bag for you tricks!\n\nLeonardo Lima is CTO at V2COM, leading the development of both embedded software for edge/field devices and server-side software that receives field data and enables fast communication with remote devices. He has more than ten years of development and architectural experience on mobile, embedded, and server platforms that enable management and operation of highly scalable and fast telemetry and network control systems. Lima is V2COM's primary representative on the JCP Executive Committee and is the JSR 363 (Units of Measurement) co-spec lead.\n\nNikhil Nanivadekar is a contributor to Eclipse Collections as well as GS Collections. He graduated from University of Utah with a Masters in Mechanical Engineering in 2012 and joined Goldman Sachs upon graduation. He is a fourth-year engineer in Private Wealth Management Technology.\n\nDonald Raab works in the Application Platform Services team at BNY Mellon in Jersey City. Donald is a member of the Java Specification Request (JSR) 335 Expert Group (Libraries) and has presented at JavaOne, EclipseCon, GIDS and the JVM Language Summit. He created the Eclipse Collections Java library which was originally open sourced as GS Collections in 2012 and migrated to the Eclipse Foundation in 2015."
