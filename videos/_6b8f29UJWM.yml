title: 'DAVID DELABASSEE - Serverless Java in Action with Fn!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1544126022
description: "Serverless computing and FaaS (Function as a Service) are the new blacks! This hands-on session will introduce you to Fn, an open source FaaS platform. Attend this session to see that Java is not antinomic to Serverless!\n\nThis hands-on session will introduce you to Fn, an open source FaaS platform. And although Fn is by design polyglot (ex. Go, JavaScript...), we will mostly focus on Java (eg. how to write/test/deploy Java functions) and related JVM topics such as Spring Cloud Function or Serverless Kotlin. We will finally discuss an important aspect, i.e. functions orchestration. For that we will use the Fn Flow API, a distributed Promise based API, to compose multiple functions into meaningful applications. Attend this session to see that Java is not antinomic to Serverless!"
