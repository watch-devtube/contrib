title: 'An intro to Probabilistic Programming with Ubers Pyro'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510325306
description: "Probabilistic programming languages are built to harness the predictive power of probability distributions. Instead of making them a feature, they use these distributions as primitives with their own set of operands that allow for the creation of stochastic control flows. Since the real world is full of uncertainty, this type of thinking is useful to help build better AI systems. I'll use Uber's newly released Pyro tool to demonstrate how they work. \n\nCode for this video (with coding challenge):\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/an_intro_to_probabilistic_programming\n\nShannon's winning code:\nhttps://github.com/DecentricCorp/Coval-Unspecified-Ml-Blockchain\n\nPlease Subscribe!
