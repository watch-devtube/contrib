Modern browsers implementing those security features are capable of doing much of the heavy lifting for us. It is our responsibility to put the browsers on guard. This talk explores which security headers are especially useful along with when and how to use them.\n\nWei is a full-time open source software developer, passionate about beautiful code and cryptocurrencies.
