description: "Marie Louise will talk about how she turns “ugly” materials into beautiful, vibrant art using her unusual techniques. However, the main focus of the talk will be on how the unavoidable (and generally ugly) financial side of making a living off your art can be handled successfully – and made pretty – without compromising either art or integrity.“\n\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
