description: 'The ultimate goal for any security team is to increase resiliency within an organization and adapt to the modern threat. Starkiller aims to provide red teams with a platform to emulate Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) tactics. Starkiller is a frontend for the post-exploitation framework, PowerShell Empire, which incorporates a multi-user GUI application that interfaces with a remote Command and Control (C2) server. Empire is powered by Python 3 and PowerShell and includes many widely used offensive security tools for Windows, Linux, and macOS exploitation. The framework''s flexibility to easily incorporate new modules allows for a single solution for red team operations. Both red and blue teams can utilize Starkiller to emulate and defend against the most used APT attack vectors.'
