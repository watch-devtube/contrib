title: 'The Event-Driven UI: Bridging the Gap'
recordingDate: 1559073436
description: 'When did you last refresh a browser to see new content on a website? Chances are you have grown accustomed to real-time updates – when something happens, the UI should be updated automatically. This is common nowadays, yet not trivial to implement at scale. How and where to handle connection state? What is easy with a monolith and a single team quickly becomes complex in an enterprise context. In this Webinar, we will take a look at different ways to enable live updates when using event-driven microservice backends. I will also introduce the Reactive Interaction Gateway, which is a CNCF Landscape project that uses open standards like Server-Sent Events and the CNCF CloudEvents specification to provide a common infrastructure for passing events to frontends seamlessly.'
