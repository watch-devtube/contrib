description: "The brief case for User-space Network Stacks (DPDK and friends) The case for DPDK, FD.io VPP, Snabb, F-Stack and friends.\nby Ray Kinsella\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2215/userspace_network_stacks.webm\n\n\nThe Userspace networking ecosystems has really matured since DPDK (the Data Plane Development Kit) was first open sourced in March 2013. Since then, a whole ecosystem of technologies developed with it or seeking to becoming a better DPDK has emerged. \n\nSometimes controversially data plane networking (the packet processing) which was once the sole responsibility of the Operating System Kernel is now being handled entirely in Userspace, by applications built with tools such as DPDK. \n\nThis talks discusses:- \n\n\nWhy the phenomenon exists? Where did it come from? Why are people eager to re-invent the wheel?\nA (very) brief survey of user space data plane networking projects.\nThe case for better inter-operability, need the Kernel and Userspace data plane really be two separate Islands?\nHow to collaborate to achieve a better future?\n\n\n\nPlease note that this talk was originally scheduled to be given on Sunday at 14:00. The talk originally in this slot, Theo: The Authorized Keys Manager by Michele Azzolari will now take place on Sunday at 14:00. \n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 18:40:00+01"
