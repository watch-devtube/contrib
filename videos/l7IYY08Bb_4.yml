description: "Michael Seid's talk is all about building a web service for the common man. While a lot of the presentations at NE Scala focus on large scale optimizations, Michael takes a step back and uses the Play! Framework (v2) as a practical place to start.\n\nThe talk uses Scala and Play! to manufacture a system capable of performing massive computations, quickly, with less blocking of resources. Michael shows us the code, and the advantages, behind the Play! framework.\n\n** By now you've seen everything from NE Scala '13, ready for more? We've got more resources, videos, and professional training all available at http://bit.ly/nescala13"
