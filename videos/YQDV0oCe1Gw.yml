description: "We're experimenting. Would you like to have your Google Cloud Platform questions answered in video? If, so, comment with your questions! To kick things off, Laurence and Brian ask each other a few questions:\nQ: What is cloud to you? How would your previous experiences change if you had had Cloud? \nQ: What is a feature of Google Cloud Platform which needs more attention?\n\nPS - don't miss the out takes at the end of the video!"
