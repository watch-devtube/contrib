recordingDate: 1499420865
description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nWe'll start with a review on recent advances in Deep Learning. Then we'll present DeepLearning4J (the first commercial-grade, open-source, distributed deep-learning library written for Java) and explore how it covers topics explained in the initial review. We'll then present a Spring Boot application with some functionality run by a Neural Network. Finally we'll explore the possibilities of implementing a Supervised Learning System using Spring Boot Actuator, which will lead to a trained monitoring system that can be interacted with actuator endpoints."
