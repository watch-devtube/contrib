description: "The long-standing belief that teams are better performing with stable membership, based on Tuckman's model of Team Development, may not be entirely accurate.\n\nDynamic teams, where people are free to move more rapidly from small group to small group are proving quite effective.

Explore why dynamic teams may be a better fit for today’s work environment and learn a bit about organizations that are operating successfully under dynamic team models."
