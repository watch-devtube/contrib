description: "Bad hotel again? Find your perfect match!\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - PyCharm [PyData]]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Elisabetta Bergamini\n\nFor most travellers, online reviews play a major role when it comes to choosing which hotel to stay in. But can we actually trust a hotel review? And if yes, how can we select which are the most meaningful and interesting for us among the billions available in platforms such as Booking.com, Tripadvisor, Facebook (just to mention a few)?\nFor 10 years now, at TrustYou we have built processes that analyze terabytes of hotel reviews at a global scale, and strive to understand what people complain about or like in the hotels worldwide.\nDealing with a huge amount of reviews written in tens of different languages - each having its own subtle shades of meanings - is the challenge we work on everyday. In this talk, we will show what goes on behind the scenes of the TrustYou Metareview and dive into the technologies and the algorithms that allow us to provide travellers with all the information they need to find the perfect hotel.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
