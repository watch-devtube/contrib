description: "asyncio in Practice: We Did It Wrong\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - Lammermuir]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Lynn Root\n\nThis talk is aimed at those that have at least intermediate experience in Python and have played around with asynchronous Python using asyncio or other libraries. I want the audience to learn from my mistakes! For instance, how easy it is to get into “callback hell” (and how to avoid/get out of it), how to screw up thread safety and deadlock yourself, and making code async but not actually concurrent.\n\nI'll talk through some anti-patterns and best practices that I learned the hard way. This includes proper concurrency, calling coroutines from synchronous code, working with threads and threadsafety, properly shutting down an async programs, and hidden \"gotchas\".\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
