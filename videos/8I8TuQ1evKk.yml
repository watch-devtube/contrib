description: "You’re probably in a room with at least a dozen objects that are connected to the internet.  And if you’re not, it won’t be long before you are. All that connectivity, and all of those devices, require a new way of thinking about cloud infrastructure, and that new way is called Edge Computing.\n\nBut creating effective edge computing infrastructure requires much more than just creating a bunch of small-footprint clouds and connecting them to a central core.\n\nJoin Mirantis Director of Engineering Satish Salagame for an in-depth technical discussion of:\n\n- What edge computing actually is and why it matters\n- How edge enables 5G and why your phone might already be using it\n- Why traditional enterprises may find themselves needing edge computing\n- Which open source technologies are involved in making edge computing possible\n- How Kubernetes fits into the Edge Cloud architecture\n- Technological issues you must resolve in order to successfully implement edge computing"
