description: "Speaker: Andy Wilkinson\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/ankinson/documenting-restful-apis-webinar\nAn API's documentation is a vital part of making it easy to understand and easy to use. RESTful APIs are no different. In this webinar we'll look at what should be included in your RESTful API's documentation and, just as importantly, what should be omitted. To illustrate this we'll look at some real-world examples of good and bad API documentation. \n\nWe'll look at some of the problems and limitations of choosing a tool like Swagger to produce your API's documentation and conclude by looking at some alternatives that are better-suited to producing documentation that your users will love.         \n\nLearn more about Spring MVC http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework\nLearn more about Spring REST Docs https://github.com/wilkinsona/spring-restdocs"
