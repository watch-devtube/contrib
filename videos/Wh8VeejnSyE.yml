language: English
recordingDate: 1495027544
description: "Like Mark Zuckerburg, over the past 18 months Dan has built a smart home. Less t-shit cannons, but more sensors, lights, plugs, alarms and device controls - all controlled through apps and voice controls. While IoT promises a lot of things and delivers on some of them, there's a lot left to be desired.\n\nJoin Dan as he covers the happy path: * A round up of the tech available - what to get, what to avoid, what's coming soon * A run down of problems that home automation can help with - did I leave the heating on? * Simple example setups, to get bootstrapped with solving some of those problems\n\nThen we dive deeper and cover topics of: * Protocols & Integration (hubs - lots of hubs) * Platforms & The Glue (IFTTT, Yonomi, SmartApps) * Security & Trust * Reliability & Connectivity * Maintenance & Cost\n\nFinally, we'll step into the world of the automation developer. Spoiler: you're not going to get too far before you get into coding. So, we'll take a look at the dev lifecycle of some of the common platforms and demo the creation of some simple solutions.\n\nAll of this will be tied back to practical advice on how to build a smart home, with some practical demos.\n\nDan Hardiker is CTO / Co-Founder of Adaptavist and has been leading a team of experts manage Atlassian applications at scale for the better part of a decade. Working with the largest Atlassian customers across the globe has given Adaptavist the opportunity to develop best practices for managing, monitoring and maintaining applications of all shapes and sizes.\n\nDan regularly speaks at tech conferences around the world, but usually spends most of his time helping Adaptavist's clients get the most business value out of their Atlassian application stack, and the ALM processes that they support."
