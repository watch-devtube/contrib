title: 'YOW! 2013 Jeff Hawkins - Computing Like the Brain: The Path to Machine Intelligence'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513953222
description: "Understanding how the brain works and building machines that work on the same principles is one of the greatest quests of our time. In this talk I will describe recent advances in neocortical theory, including why the brain uses sparse distributed representations and how the brain makes predictions from high velocity sensory data streams.\n\nI will demonstrate a product called Grok, that uses a detailed model of neocortical memory to act on machine generated data and how developers can contribute to the development of intelligent machines via the NuPIC open source project (www.numenta.org).\n\nI will end my talk with a discussion of the future of machine intelligence.\n\nJeff Hawkins is co-founder of Grok (formerly known as Numenta). Jeff is an entrepreneur, scientist, and author. He was a founder of two mobile computing companies, Palm and Handspring, and was the architect of many computing products such as the PalmPilot and Treo smartphone. Throughout his life Jeff has also been active in neuroscience and modeling the neocortex. In 2002 he founded the Redwood Neuroscience Institute, a scientific institute focused on understanding how the neocortex processes information. The institute is now located at U.C. Berkeley. In 2004 he wrote the book On Intelligence, which describes progress on understanding the neocortex. In 2005 he co-founded Numenta (now Grok), a start-up company building a technology based on neocortical theory. It is his hope that Grok will play a catalytic role in the emerging field of machine intelligence.\n\nJeff Hawkins earned his B.S. in electrical engineering from Cornell University in 1979. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2003\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
