description: "Justin Lee, Principal Software Engineer, Red Hat\n\nServerless computing is the natural progression of the microservice philosophy. This session takes a look at what that is and the benefits of going serverless. You’ll see how you can get started writing, testing, and deploying your functions on top of Apache OpenWhisk. Several examples show various features with several different programming languages. To top it all off, the presentation reveals how easy it is to test everything locally by using OpenShift to manage your OpenWhisk system."
