description: "Ember, Angular, React, Polymer, and Backbone. Following in jQuery's footsteps, these projects (and others) are helping to drive some future APIs in the browser.\n\nWhile they all get lumped into the category \"Frontend MVC\", an intimate look at each reveals they are quite different. These stark and subtle differences matter when choosing one for your project.\n\nIn this session, you'll see each project's sweet spot, and where each struggles. You'll get a healthy dose of code as we explore the primary APIs. You will walk away with a better understanding of the goals and intended use-cases for each project.\n\nhttp://2014.jsconf.us/"
