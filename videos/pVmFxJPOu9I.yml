description: "Antidrone system industries have arised. Due to several, and even classic, vulnerabilities in communication systems now used by drones , anti-drone systems are able to take down those drone by means of well documented attacks. \n\nDrone/antidrone competition has already been set into the scene. This talk provides a new vision about drone protection against anti-drone systems, presenting \"The Interceptor Project\", a hand-sized nano drone based on single-core tiniest Linux Board: Vocore2. \n\nThis Linux board manages a WiFi (side/hidden) bidirectional channel communication that cannot be deauthenticated and it is replay-resistant, keeping all 802.11 hacking capabilities and standard utilities as any other WiFi hacker drone, with only the built-in adapter of the tiny Vocore2. Also, a \"just in case\", fallback control by SDR is implemented taking advantage of all the goods that SDR radio gives. All embedded into a hand-sized aircraft to make detection and mitigation a real and new pain, with a very low budget: About $70."
