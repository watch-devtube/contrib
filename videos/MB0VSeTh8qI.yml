But in 2012, it's the data that will make the difference.\n\nIn this Strata Online Event, we'll look at the way data science is shaping elections, from visualizations to game theory, from understanding issues to targeting voters. In what promises to be a heated and controversial election year, get a glimpse into the data that's driving how we choose tomorrow's leaders.\n\nPresenters Include: Edd Dumbill - O'Reilly Media, Alexander Howard - O'Reilly Media, Eimar Boesjes- Moonshadow Mobile, Jeremy Dunck- Votizen, Amanda Michel - Guardian US, Clifton van der Linden - Vote Compass, Patrick Ruffini - Engage, Simon Rogers - Guardian.UK,"
