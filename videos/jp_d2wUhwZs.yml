description: "Objectwheel is a new user-definable social media platform and rapid development framework that includes search and a browser that’s based on JavaFX. The platform uses intelligent templates to create content that can be shared via social media with a client app or URL load. Inside the screen designer, end users or programmers drag and drop rich controls and fields onto a blank template and create powerful GUIs. The primary goal is to create a new social media platform that encourages interaction and data sharing between users. Plans include incorporating W3C Semantic Web intelligence into everything that touches Objectwheel. The platform is private and secure and runs as a client or app, not as a website.
