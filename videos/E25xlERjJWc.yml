description: 'The last few years have been pretty exciting for Java, with new versions of the EE and SE platforms. Java EE introduced a new API for building WebSockets; a new API for parsing, processing, and generating JSON; a new client API in JAX-RS for invoking REST services; and the batch processing API for building batch applications. Java SE brought us the long-awaited lambda expressions; the powerful Streams API for performing operations such as filtering, mapping, or sorting in a very easy and fluent way; and a brand-new date/time API for dealing with the complexities of time zones and periods. This session combines all these elements and shows you, with live coding and samples, how to easily develop an application by using Java SE 8 with Java EE 7.'
