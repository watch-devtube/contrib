description: "Serverless computing is a cloud-computing model where the cloud provider acts as the server, dynamically managing the allocation of machine resources. What that means is 'pay-as-you-use' pricing for the developer for their computing tasks. In this video i'll walk through some useful parts of the Google Cloud suite of services and use it to help train+test a wide+deep neural network to predict customer purchasing power. Topics covered include cloud computing models, kubernetes, Colab, and regression models.
