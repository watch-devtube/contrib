recordingDate: 1490883187
description: "http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017/william-blum\n\n\n\nProject Springfield is a business incubation from Microsoft that brings best practices for security testing in a cloud service entirely built in F#.  This talk tells the story behind adopting a functional programming language in a large company like Microsoft, and how it helped quickly prototype an MVP for a brand-new cloud service offering. I will share my personal experience with functional programming, how I got to live the dream of working as a functional programmer and eventually lead a team of F# developers at Microsoft."
