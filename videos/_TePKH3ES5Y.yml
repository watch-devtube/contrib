title: 'Pragmatic Functional Refactoring with Java 8 (Richard Warburton, UK)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1437553402
description: "You may be hearing a lot of buzz around functional programming. For example, Java 8 recently introduced new features (lambda expressions and method references) and APIs (Streams, Optional and CompletableFutures) inspired from functional ideas such as first-class functions, composition and immutability. However, what does this mean for my existing codebase?\n\nIn this talk we show how you can refactor your traditional object-oriented Java to using FP features and APIs from Java 8 in a beneficial manner. We will discuss things like:\n\n - How to adapt to requirement changes using first-class functions.\n - How you can enhance code reusability using currying.\n - How you can make your code more robust by favouring immutability over mutability.\n - How you can reduce null pointer exceptions with Optional."
