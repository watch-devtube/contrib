title: 'CppCon 2015: Milian Wolff "Modern User Interfaces for C++”'

description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nThe C++ language evolved significantly in the recent past, and so did many frameworks and libraries in the big ecosystem surrounding it. \n\nFor twenty years now, Qt is being used on a multitude of platforms to create native looking, compelling graphical user interfaces.\n\nIt offers C++ libraries and tools for building desktop, mobile and embedded applications. Qt gives engineers APIs for developing using two dimensional controls, integrating 3D using OpenGL, embedding web content, as well as a new declarative domain-specific language called QML, which is extensible using C++. Qt is also much more than a UI toolkit and provides a multitude of helper libraries for various use-cases, such as localization, database access, XML and JSON parsing and much more. \n\nDuring this talk, I will give an introduction to Qt and present its capabilities in how it can be utilized to write modern UIs using C++, both in 2D as well as 3D. Additionally, I will show how some of its features, like the integrated web engine or QML, can be leveraged to go beyond C++. While at it, I hope to clear up some outdated misconceptions about Qt and its relationship to standard C++ and the STL as well as Boost and other libraries.\n\nFinally, I will present the KDE Frameworks, an open source collection of high quality, cross platform Qt libraries that are being used by the KDE Software Collection. KDE frameworks are to Qt as Boost is to the STL. Recent development makes it simpler than ever to use these libraries in external applications.\n— \nMilian Wolff works as a Software Engineer at KDAB, an expert Qt, C++ and OpenGL consultancy. He contributes to Qt and KDE for several years now. Besides that, improving tooling around C++ development is of huge interest to him: As the co-maintainer of the KDevelop IDE, he is currently integrating Clang there\nto replace the handwritten C++ parser and semantic analyzer. Performance of C++ code is very important to him,\nand he wrote tools such as Massif-Visualizer and heaptrack to guide developers in finding issues in their code bases.\nHe holds a Master of Science in physics and is enthusiastic about Free Open Source Software in general and Linux and KDE in particular.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
