description: "Deep Dive: Chaos Engineering BoF - Sylvain Hellegouarch, ChaosIQ & Julien Bisconti, 56k.cloud \n\n Automating Chaos Engineering with a Service Mesh and the Chaos Toolkit In this talk, Julien and Sylvain will take you on the journey of performing Chaos Engineering exploration and automation of a simple set of services backed by Istio, a service mesh provider. Julien will first demo how you can degrade conditions in your system through the Istio fault injection API, with a very small blast radius to not impact users. Sylvain will then demonstrate how you can automate Julien's work with the Chaos Toolkit to run Chaos Engineering experiments in a continuous manner while surfacing these executions for greater observability. This presentation will be a good introduction on practicing Chaos Engineering. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Gren"
