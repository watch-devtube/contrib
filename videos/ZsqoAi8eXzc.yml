recordingDate: 1481790476
description: 'The development of our AG racing game Redout has been quite a ride. Started in 2014, when 34BigThings was still a bunch of friends working in a living room, it has gone through many epiphanies and revolutions before taking its final shape. In this talk I will go through the development stages of the Redout game product: I''ll talk about track design and game flow, interface design, vehicle handling, community management, talking to publishers and the press, attending events, observing players play, and how all this influenced the overall design of the game and my own knowledge of game design.'
