description: "The talk is to introduce you to the world of reactive web programming in Scala using Spray toolkit (that’s soon to be Akka HTTP) and Play Framework. I’m going to show you how to get started and why you should have a special place for Spray/Akka HTTP and Play Framework in your toolbox.\n\nThe talk is very Scala code heavy so expect a mixture of slides and IntelliJ IDEA."
