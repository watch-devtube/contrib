title: 'YOW! Connected 2015 - Maksim Lin - The Secret Life of Services'
recordingDate: 1447056076
description: "Unlike their showy cousins Activities and Fragments, Android Services are often left out of the limelight, staying quietly in the background, carrying out the book-keeping jobs needed to display all those fancy UI elements on the screen.\n\nBut do you really know about Services? While they have much fewer life-cycle callbacks then Activities, there are plenty of interesting and unexpected behaviours and not-quite documented features that you should be aware of when using Services.\n\nThis talk will take a quick journey through some interesting facets of using Services, with plenty of real world code examples from apps I’ve recently worked on to help you make the most of using Services in your Android apps.\n\nMaksim is a freelance developer who over the years has worked on everything from phone exchanges to large corporate websites to mobile webapps and Android app development. Previously senior developer at the National Gallery of Victoria, he now specialises in Android development and he’s spent the last few years working on various parts of the Android OS from user apps all the way down to the Linux kernel.\n\nFor more on YOW!
