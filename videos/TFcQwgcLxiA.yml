description: "From the 2014 Strata Conference + Hadoop World in New York City, Sharmila Shahani-Mulligan's keynote, \"Data & The New Era of Interactive Storytelling.\"\n\nData is an evolving story. It’s not a static snapshot of a point in time insight. With data from internal and external sources constantly updating, we are evolving from rear-view mirror dashboard views into an era of interactive Storytelling. Data Storytelling is both a visual art and a method of interpreting analytic results. Data Stories shed insights every minute, every hour, everyday, every week. This keynote will discuss how data dashboards are no longer adequate and how companies are using Interactive Storytelling to discover faster insights across many disparate data sources.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by ClearStory Data.\n\nAbout Sharmila Shahani-Mulligan:\nSharmila has spent 18+ years building game-changing software companies in a variety of markets.
