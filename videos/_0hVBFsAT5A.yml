description: "Speaker: Michael Heap (@mheap)\n\nCode archaeology is one of the most important skills you’ll ever learn as a developer. How many times have you been thrown into projects with no environment setup, no documentation, and very little support from coworkers? Being able to quickly work out how an application is structured so that you can start making changes is a sought after skill for many employers.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll take an open source project that we’ve never seen before and work through the steps required to get it up and running so that we can start working on features. Once you know the steps, they can be applied to any project in any language to get you contributing in no time.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nMichael is a fixer, working mainly with with PHP/Go/MySQL and doing bits of server administration on the side, he goes where things need working on. Currently, he's a member of the platform team at Datasift, working as part of a team that processes and augments various incoming data sources (including the Facebook firehose) before redistributing it to customers.\n\nEvent Page: https://2016.phpconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VGXr/"
