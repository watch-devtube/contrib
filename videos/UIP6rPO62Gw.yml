recordingDate: 1514388551
description: "Working effectively with large volumes of data presents challenging technica?l and human factors ?issues. For example, how can today’s analyst iteratively process, display and explore 10s of? millions records in order to identify new trends or patterns. Over the last few years, we have been wrestling with some of the more pragmatic aspects of trying to build and deliver a big data analytic solution that meets the needs of the typical analyst.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss several of the ?technical and human factor issues with making big data accessible to the data scientist or analyst. Topics covered will include what type of interactive analysis support is required for large datasets, what types of visualizations are needed for big data, what type of scripting or programming support is needed for analysts, how to address the typical analyst task flow in a big data solution and the need for non-linear task flow support. In addition, they will discuss some of the generic ways of dynamically visualizing data and the fundamental principles of good visual design for data.\n\nDoug Talbott is a product design consultant with Bedarra Research Labs (BRL) specializing in the research and development of user interface designs and advanced visualization solutions for complex systems.\n\nHe has over 25 years of experience in producing and/or managing the development of award-winning content, visual design, user experience design and instructional design for organizations such as Cognos, IBM, Department of National Defence, Department of Finance, Secretary of State, Nortel Networks, OTI, Carleton University, and Honeywell Information Systems.\n\nHe holds numerous design patents. Most notably, he is a co-inventor of the visual language for iLog’s Telecom Graphics Objects (TGO) product – the defacto visual standard in telecommunications management user interfaces.\n\nDoug holds a B.F.A in Communications Design. He teaches graphic design part-time at Online-Learning.com and is a regular guest lecturer at Carleton University’s Human Oriented Technology (HOT) Lab.\n\nFor more on YOW!
