description: "Modern applications consist of small, highly interconnected, independently scalable units of deployment that are often referred to as “microservices.” When you deploy these services on Cloud Foundry today, they are forced to communicate via routes that are advertised to the external routing tier. Not only does this force all services to be exposed to external clients, it adds significant latency to the interactions between services. \n\nWhat if instead of exposing routes to all of your services, you could define the network topology that’s right for your application? How about defining an isolation policy to prevent unauthorized access? What about enabling secure access to existing networks? \n\nThe Cloud Foundry Container Networking project hopes to make these things a reality. Come learn about where we are today, where we’re going, and how you can help us get there. \n\nGabriel Rosenhouse\nSoftware Engineer, Pivotal\nGabe is a software engineer at the Pivotal office in Santa Monica, California. He is currently working on the Cloud Foundry Container Networking team.\n\nMatthew Sykes\nSTSM, IBM\nMatthew is an senior technical staff member in IBM's open cloud technology group. He has been involved with Cloud Foundry since 2013 as part of the elastic runtime and Diego teams. He is currently working on the Cloud Foundry container networking project to enable flexible, efficient, and secure communications between containers and legacy networks. Prior to his work on Cloud Foundry, he worked on IBM application servers and middleware."
