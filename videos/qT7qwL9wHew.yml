recordingDate: 1541516705
description: 'Software expertise is a vital component of a software project success. Software products are created by people and their skills and talents determine the result to a large extent. However, people can''t really be attached to a project forever, they change work places and companies, taking their knowledge with them. It''s a well-known fact that subject domain experts are important and dangerous at the same time. In the presentation I will share my experience of dealing with highly qualified programmers and transferring their knowledge to project artifacts. I will present a concept of experts-free software development, which is practiced in our distributed teams.'
