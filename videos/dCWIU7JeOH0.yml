The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nA Future Journey: How to Migrate 100 Clusters Between Clouds Without Downtime? - Tobias Schneck & Manuel Stößel, Kubermatic \n\nHave you ever thought about migrating your Kubernetes clusters to another cloud provider to save costs? Yes? We too! Join us on an interactive journey to discover the main challenges of live migration at scale of etcd’s, traffic routing and application workloads from one cloud to another. The talk will discuss the current state of the technical concept, known problems and insides of the already proven migration steps for stateless workload.  As part of the journey, we’ll see the differences between migrating one or one hundred clusters with productive workloads; What parts can be automated? What steps may need to be manual? Let’s see how an automated solution could look like in the future and what steps are missing. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekDU"
