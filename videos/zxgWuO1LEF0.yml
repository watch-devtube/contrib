title: 'Transactional Event Sourcing Using Slick (Audit Log for Free!) by Adam Warski'
recordingDate: 1469195713
description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Berlin 2016\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAnstract:\nEvent sourcing is a great alternative to traditional \"CRUD\"-type architectures. The central concept is a persistent stream of events, which drives all changes to the read model and running any kind of business logic. There’s a lot of technical and business benefits to such an approach, such as being able to re-create the state of the system at any point in time, or keeping a detailed *audit log* of all actions. Typically, implementations of event sourcing are presented using a NoSQL data storage, which is great for many use cases (e.g. using Akka Persistence + Cassandra). However, nothing stops us from using a relational database and SQL! In many applications (especially “enterprise”), this brings many benefits, such as powerful and familiar query capabilities and higher guarantees around data consistency. \n\nIn this mainly live-coding talk we’ll see one way of implementing transactional event sourcing using the 'slick-eventsourcing' micro-framework, introducing the core concepts: command handlers, read model updates and event listeners, and how to use them to build an event-sourced application. We’ll see how Slick’s 'DBAction' and Scala flexibility makes it possible to provide an elegant DSL to build the system from simple functions with minimum dependencies."
