description: "We're going to create a visual grid of squares with obstacles in it. Then, we'll use computer vision and a path planning algorithm to find the optimal route from point A to point B in the grid. You'll need the OpenCV, scikit-image, and numpy libraries installed for python.\n\nPlease subscribe! and like and comment. That's what keeps me going.\n\nThe code for this video is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/path_planning_demo_live\n\nJoin us in our Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nMore learning resources:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoBeujec74\nhttps://www.raywenderlich.com/4946/introduction-to-a-pathfinding\nhttp://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/tutorials.html\nhttps://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810\n\n\nand please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
