He will share several stories of his travels & exploits but mostly will be there to answer questions about hacking, blue team, red team and DEF CON Groups! So come with questions and expect a few answers and a lot of great hugs! \n\nSpeaker Profile\n\nJayson E. Street is an Author of Dissecting the Hack: The F0rb1dd3n Network from Syngress.
