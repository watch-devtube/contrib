description: "Video recording of a presentation given at JDK IO conference in Copenhagen in June 2018 at the IT-University organized by the Danish Java User Group - Javagruppen.\n\nhttps://jdk.io/jdk-io-2018/speakers/211-johan-janssen\n\nREST no more - Using Actors for the Internet of (LEGO) Trains & Raspberry Pi's\n\nSpeaker: Johan Janssen\n\nTwo years ago we started a new Internet of Things project: The Internet of (Lego) Trains. We wanted to figure out if we could use Java/Scala to build software for IoT hardware like the Raspberry Pi.\n\nThe Lego trains are equipped with a Raspberry Pi, camera, wireless dongle, infrared transmitter, speaker, RFID reader and battery pack. Next to that we have automated switch tracks and cameras again with the help of Raspberry Pis. To control the trains and other parts we built an actor based application with Scala, Akka, Akka HTTP and AngularJS.\n\nThe session will cover when and how to use Akka HTTP and remote actors to create a new generation of applications. The results of the performance tests we did to compare the two options will be shown as well. A live demo with Lego trains is of course included."
