description: "On the OSS Path to Full Observability with Grafana - David Kaltschmidt, Grafana Labs \n\nGrafana is coming “off the wall”. To make it more useful for interactive debugging, David and his team have already integrated two pillars of observability - metrics and logs. They are currently adding tracing to complete the incident response experience. All to minimise the cost of context switching during those crucial minutes after getting paged. This talk will demonstrate the various methods we’ve used to link the data together. Prometheus is providing the metrics. Via its histograms, request latencies can be extracted to inform each tracing span from Jaeger. Grafana also ensures that lines from your log aggregation system are annotated with span and trace IDs, as well as the other way around: associating logged values with spans. David will show how these OSS parts should be deployed to achieve full observability in an engaging user experience that saves valuable minutes. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrXC"
