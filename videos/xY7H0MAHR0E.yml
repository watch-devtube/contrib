description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\n\nThis talk is mainly about how we utilize Erlang to build a unified platform that can act as a solid, concurrent backend for HTML5 webapps. Qiyun Webapp platform provides the whole tool chain and a unified platform for designing, developing, deploying and hosting HTML5 webapps. It includes project management, online editor, WYSIWYGE IDE,version control, database design and operation tools, security control, all integrated.Users can write their backend logic in Javascript which is parsed and compiled to run in Erlang VM. More details can be found in http://qyapp.com/qiyun/website/quickstart-en.html.\nErlang is the infrastructure and the power horse that makes all these possible. In this talk I will give technical details about how all these features are implemented in Erlang and why we think Erlang is a natural fit in building cloud platform for webapps. With browser and Javascript, HTML5,CSS3 as UI frontend and Erlang as backend, we dare say that this mode is the future of any apps."
