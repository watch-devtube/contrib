title: 'My secure API secret sauce - Niclas Kjellin'
recordingDate: 1548410621
description: "API's are today commonplace. They enable new, creative and innovative usages for our data. Unfortunately, API's are not a security layer. Their primary purpose is to allow quick and easy access.\n\nLuckily, there are many ways to add security. But with endless variations of methods and keys, it is not always easy to know what to do. Access keys, secret keys, shared keys, signing keys, hashed keys, one-time keys, and what-not-keys. What does it take to create a secure API? Is there a secret recipe? Any rituals? Or is it dumb luck?\n\nWorking for Softhouse as a software security expert Niclas Kjellin has designed secure systems for many companies and products. Over the years he realized that security does not happen by magic. Knowing when and where to focus the effort is half the work. However, his real mission is to help developers to understand the concept of security and deliver better software.\n____________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \n\nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \n\nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
