description: "Intro: Cloud Native Buildpacks – Terence Lee & Joe Kutner, Salesforce Heroku \n\nYou're great at running containers but you shouldn't have to be great at building them. In this talk, you'll learn about Cloud Native Buildpacks, a higher-level abstraction for building apps compared to Dockerfiles.Buildpacks are a standardized tool for creating images in a secure, reproducible, and efficient manner. As an app developer, you don't need to know best practices around ordering commands for layer reuse. As an operator, you don't need to worry about exposing developers to the responsibilities that come with Dockerfile.Come learn how buildpacks meet developers at their source code, automate the delivery of both OS-level and application-level dependency upgrades, and help you efficiently handle day-2 app operations. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/I1Xo"
