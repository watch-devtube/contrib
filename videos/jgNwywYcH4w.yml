description: "Google just made it really easy for anyone to use a \"Tensor Processing Unit\" (TPU) to train machine learning models. Their open-source research tool (Google Colab) now lets developer select a \"TPU\" as their run-time environment. Are TPUs the next big thing in machine learning? In this video, I'll benchmark the TPU vs the GPU, talk about what the hardware looks like, describe its use cases, then do some TPU specific live programming to train a model to do some natural language processing. Get hype!\n\nCode is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/TPU_Machine_Learning\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment. That's what keeps me going. \n\nWant more education?
