description: "Nine times out of ten, when you hear about deep learning breaking a new technological barrier, Convolutional Neural Networks are involved. Also called CNNs or ConvNets, these are the workhorse of the deep neural network field. They have learned to sort images into categories even better than humans in some cases. If there’s one method out there that justifies the hype, it is CNNs.\n\nWhat’s especially cool about them is that they are easy to understand, at least when you break them down into their basic parts. I’ll walk you through it. There's a video that talks through these images in greater detail. If at any point you get a bit lost, just click on an image and you'll jump to that part of the video.\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB8T_zN7ZC0"
