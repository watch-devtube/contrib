description: "Let's skip the boring plumbing parts of building a web app and head right to the fun stuff.\n\nFirebase handles a lot for you, like real time database syncing and user authentication, letting you focus on what makes your web app special. Now the newest version of Firebase empowers you to do even more, including file storage and the ability to hook into other cloud services. It's all serverless so you can get up and running in minutes.\n\nIn this talk we'll live code a fun and surprisingly functional web-based game using some of the features of Firebase and release it live for the world to see.\n\nBret McGowen is on the Google Cloud Platform team at Google, focusing on developer-oriented products like App Engine, Compute Engine, the Cloud Vision API, Firebase and more. He's currently an aspiring Node.js developer. Prior to Google, Bret came from Texas, having worked in the cloud industry at Rackspace as a software engineer building the RackConnect hybrid hosting product. Before that, he led engineering teams at e-commerce, non-profit and startup companies. He's often on the running trail, volleyball court or kickball field.\n\nBret earned a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Texas A&M University.\n\n[JVY-2604]"
