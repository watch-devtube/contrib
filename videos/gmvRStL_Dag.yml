description: "Generative Adversarial Networks are back! We'll use the cutting edge StackGAN architecture to let us generate images from text descriptions alone. This is pretty wild stuff and there is so much room for improvement. The possibilities are endless. I'll go through the architecture, code, and the implications of this technology for humanity.\n\nSpecial shoutout to new Patrons Joshua Tobkin, Cameron Tofer, and Zarathustra Technologies. I'll add you guys to the credits next video. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/how_to_convert_text_to_images\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
