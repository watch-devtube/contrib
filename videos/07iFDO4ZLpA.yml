description: "What do you do when the project of redesigning emails AND making them responsive becomes yours? You've heard the rumors: designing emails means coding like it’s the year 2000, creating tables and adding styles inline, and throwing best practices and hopes of compatibility out the window. BREATHE. In this session, get your emails in shape for 2016 and ready for the responsive spotlight! We’ll see: \n\n- Why you need a reusable, maintainable template and how to design one.\n- When and how to use media queries and the ever controversial !important.\n- What vendors and properties require CSS prefixes\n- How to make desktop, mobile, and web-based clients play nicely with your code, and which ones to watch out for.\n\nJennifer is a self taught web developer. She spends her days on the front end, making the web a prettier and more functional place. In a former life, she was a civil engineer and is still a registered Engineer in Training (No. EIT 121059) with the California Department of Consumer Affairs. She's a jane of all trades and loves eating, coding, and sleeping.\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore - 18 November 2015.\n\nSource: http://2015.cssconf.asia\nSlides: http://jennz0r.github.io/2000/#/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
