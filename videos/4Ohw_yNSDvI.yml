description: "Keynote: Confessions of a Cloud Foundry PaaS Product Owner: How to Create a Successful Devops Team in an Enterprise - Emma Hammond, Associate Director, Fidelity\n\nSome would say successful devops is all about having the right tools. Emma Hammond believes it is all about people. It’s about trust & responsibility with the freedom to innovate, take risk & learn from failure. Much of this is alien to a traditional financial enterprise governed & protected by processes derived from years of operation – the ‘scar tissue’. Through the use of Cloud Foundry and software defined networks, Fidelity have been able to generate a new way of working to help mend these wounds and show the art of what is possible. Emma is very proud to have created the first devops team in Fidelity – their journey is worth sharing.\n\nAbout Emma Hammond\nFidelity International was established in 1969 & is responsible for managing over £185.1 billion for investors around the world, offering 732 funds across all sectors, regions & asset classes supported by 390 investment professionals working across 12 countries. We have been using Cloud Foundry for 2 years (15 months running Production applications on it). We participate in London Cloud Foundry meetups & presented in Berlin last November. The speaker is experienced in presenting, having done so both publicly in the UK & professionally globally."
