description: "At NoRedInk, we've been heavily using Elm and React side-by-side in production for over a year. After 35,000 lines of Elm code and about the same for React, we've learned a lot about how well these powerful technologies coexist in a code base that's been battle-tested by students who have used it to answer over a billion questions. This talk will be a deep dive into Elm and React from a production perspective—what's familiar, what's different, and how they can work together. We'll start with initial adoption, continue on to shipping new features, and progress all the way through maintenance and scaling. We'll also look at the nontechnical impact of each: hiring, onboarding, and managing technical debt. Come see how two of the most revolutionary front end technologies on the planet can work together!\n\nEVENT:\n\nReactiveConf 2016\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRichard Feldman\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nReactiveConf Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nReactiveConf YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBHdUnixTWymmXBIw12Y8Qg\n\nReactiveConf web-site: https://reactiveconf.com"
