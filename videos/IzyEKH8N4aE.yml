title: 'GopherCon UK 2018: Mahdi Jelodari - GoPro: More Concurrent than Parallel!'
recordingDate: 1535661928
description: 'Complex systems call for better controllability over various design parameters (data and control widths, on-/off- chip memory, topology etc.). Unlike software based simulations, rapid FPGA-accelerated prototyping (using GoPro) will allow faster simulation and exploration of large scale systems.'
