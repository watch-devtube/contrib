recordingDate: 1424465212
description: "Open data is quickly gaining momentum and when applied as data for good, it becomes a much more powerful concept that we should all consider as good data stewards. Organizations to cities are starting to share data like traffic conditions or climate sensors and allowing others to use this open data to improve quality of life. But could this same open data be used for more nefarious reasons? Very likely so in this session we will bridge the balance between sharing data and locking it down, and how security should be on by default to protect all data including open data.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop San Jose 2015: http://goo.gl/k9J3GB\nVisit the conference website to learn more: http://strataconf.com/big-data-conference-ca-2015/\nSubscribe to O’Reilly on YouTube! http://goo.gl/szEauh\n\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia\n\nAbout Eddie Garcia (Cloudera):\nEddie Garcia is chief security architect at Cloudera, a leader in enterprise analytic data management.
