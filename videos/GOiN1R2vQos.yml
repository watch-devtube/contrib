description: "Intro + Deep Dive: Multicluster SIG - Irfan Ur Rehman, Huawei & Maru Newby, Red Hat \n\nSIG-Multicluster is focused on solving common challenges related to the management of many Kubernetes clusters, across many cloud providers (so-called hybrid cloud) and applications deployed across this these many, hybrid clusters. We are responsible for designing, discussing, implementing and maintaining API’s, tools and documentation related to multi-cluster administration and application management. This includes not only active automated approaches such as Cluster Federation, but also those that employ batch workflow-style continuous deployment systems like Spinnaker and others. Standalone building blocks for these and other similar systems (for example a cluster registry), and proposed changes to kubernetes core where appropriate are in scope.  In the introduction, we will give you an overview of the projects we're currently actively working on, how best to get involved, and what our future plans look like.  Then we'll dive deeper! We recently released the second version of our biggest project, Federation v2 as Beta, and have gathered user feedback on how and why several different companies are using it to solve their particular multi-cluster use cases. In this deep-dive session we'll take you through what's in this beta release, and the results of our findings about its real-world usage. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPlP"
