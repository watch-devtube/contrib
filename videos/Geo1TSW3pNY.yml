description: "http://jdk.io/\n\nJava EE 7 was released in june 2013 and brought a lot of new things and evolutions.\nIn this talk we'll explore most of these new feature by developing a demo application which will make use of Websocket 1.0, CDI 1.1, Interceptor 1.2, JPA 2.1, JSONP 1.0 or JMS 2.0. We'll use JBoss WildFly as Java EE server but all examples should also run on any Java EE 7 compliant server like Glassfish 4.0."
