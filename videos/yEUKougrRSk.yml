description: "Everyone needs to understand regression! Its a useful data science technique that allows us to understand the relationship between different variables. In this video, we'll play the role of a newly hired data analyst at a genetics company trying to find the relationship between advertising mediums (TV, newspaper, radio) and ticket sales to our newly opened theme park. Along the way, we'll learn about 5 types of regression models (linear, non-linear, multiple, lasso, and ridge). Expect math, code, and layers of explanation.
