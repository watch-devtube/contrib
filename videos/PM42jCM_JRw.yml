title: '''Software Architecture also Needs Agile'' by Boyan Mihaylov'
language: English
recordingDate: 1437212987
description: 'Software architecture is a vital part of the project development life cycle. Done explicitly by a software architect or implicitly in the head of a developer, it has an important role in the whole process. Changes in the requirements, vague definitions, and poor documentation, however, are some of the usual problems software architects encounter. On the other hand Agile methodology gives us ideas how to deal with these problems. Iterations, meetings, and early evaluations are some of the proposed techniques. Can one apply Agile in the context of software architecture? How can a software architect react on specification changes? How can we keep up-to-date documentation of our system? In this talk I will try to give answers to these questions based on my experience and I will do a short demo to illustrate a real scenario.'
