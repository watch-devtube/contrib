description: 'This session will present how concepts of "mechanical sympathy" have been applied to Jetty 9 in order to improve its performance over Jetty 8. After an introduction to modern processors, the session will present real code cases taken from Jetty 9, the tools used to measure the performance, from false sharing to parallel slowdown, to branchless code and lockless code. The session concludes with an eye to the pitfalls that you may encounter while trying to apply these optimizations, and the JVM support for these class of optimizations.'
