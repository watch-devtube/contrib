description: "Client side web technologies continue to advance at breakneck speed. The quest to deliver richer user experiences is relentless and due to the limitations of HTTP/1.x, we have been forced to develop various workarounds (domain sharding, spriting, resource concatenation and inlining) in a bid to optimize performance.\n\nHTTP/2 has been designed with the modern web in mind and eliminates the need for such compensating hacks. In this session we'll take an in-depth look at web performance optimization; the best practices that have evolved; the game changing new features of HTTP/2; and most importantly what you need to do to deliver a world class HTTP/2 experience:\n\n- Why domain sharding, resource concatenation and image sprites are now anti-patterns\n- How server push is effectively resource inlining on steroids\n- What new best practices are possible with HTTP/2\n- What techniques to apply during the transitional period from HTTP/1.x to HTTP/2\n\nAdditionally, we will look at the tooling available for working with HTTP/2 traffic and how we can ensure that we're getting the full benefit of HTTP/2 both client and server side."
