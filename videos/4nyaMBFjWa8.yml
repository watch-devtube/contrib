title: 'A Microservice Two Ways'
recordingDate: 1501170339
description: 'We will build out the same microservice in both Grails and Ratpack. See how they each framework compares. There will not be a winner but a show of strengths and differences of both frameworks. We will cover RDBMS interactions, caching, json marshaling, and testing.At the end of this talk you will have a better understanding of how these frameworks relate to each other and be able to use these differences to pick the right tool for the job.'
