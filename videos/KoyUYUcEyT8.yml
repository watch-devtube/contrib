description: "Learn PyTorch and implement deep neural networks (and classic machine learning models). This is a hands on tutorial which is geared toward people who are new to PyTorch.\n\nPyTorch is a relatively new neural network library which offers a nice tensor library, automatic differentiation for gradient descent, strong and easy gpu support, dynamic neural networks, and is easy to debug.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyData Berlin 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nStefan Otte\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPyData Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H3aw6wkCv0"
