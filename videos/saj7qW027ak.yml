description: 'The promise of the cloud is the reduction of friction between development and deployment. It’s continuous delivery. It’s the ability to think about apps, not kernels. In this talk, we’ll look at how Cloud Foundry, the open-source PaaS from the Linux Foundation that underpins IBM’s BlueMix and HP’s Helion products, and serves large users like Baidu and NTT, can be used to deploy, scale, auto-heal, monitor and analyze applications. We’ll look at how to use the API to master your runtime and we’ll also look at the next generation of Cloud Foundry, code-named Lattice, and its Docker-first support.'
