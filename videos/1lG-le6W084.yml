But in order to grow you have to push yourself out of this comfort zone and be (momentarily) not smart. You have to take risks.\n\nAnd being great at operations means much more than being technically competent.\n\nTo be truly successful you have to understand people. Every one of your teammates and everyone one of your customers is a person. And to get what you want, you have to build trust and meaning with those people.\n\nThis talk will discuss the importance of trust, authenticity, and meaning in engineering and operations role, and provide suggestions to empower you to thrive and achieve truly great things.\n\nAbout Kate Matsudaira\n\nKate specializes in creating and operating large-scale web applications.
