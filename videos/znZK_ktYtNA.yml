description: "Applying domain-driven design (DDD) can be hard in the best of times. How do you apply DDD when the business and domain evolve faster than your software can? How do you handle pivots into new domains and customers that use nonstandard nomenclature. This session considers these and other challenges to DDD. It considers examples of where DDD has been helpful, when there was a failure to maintain a ubiquitous language, and what the consequences were.\n\n\nAuthor:\n Benjamin Weber\nBenji is a polyglot software developer who has been working in and leading extreme programming teams at Unruly for the last few years.
