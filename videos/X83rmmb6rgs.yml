description: "http://flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/apache-beam-a-unified-model-for-batch-and-streaming-data-processing/\n\nUnbounded, unordered, global-scale datasets are increasingly common in day-to-day business, and consumers of these datasets have detailed requirements for latency, cost, and completeness. Apache Beam (incubating) defines a new data processing programming model that evolved from more than a decade of experience within Google, including MapReduce, FlumeJava, MillWheel, and Cloud Dataflow. Beam handles both batch and streaming use cases and neatly separates properties of the data from runtime characteristics, allowing pipelines to be portable across multiple runtimes, both open-source (e.g., Apache Flink, Apache Spark, et al.) and proprietary (e.g., Google Cloud Dataflow). This talk will cover the basics of Apache Beam, touch on its evolution, describe main concepts in the programming model, and compare with similar systems. We’ll go from a simple scenario to a relatively complex data processing pipeline, and finally demonstrate execution of that pipeline on multiple runtimes."
