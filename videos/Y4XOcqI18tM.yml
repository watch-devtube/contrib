description: "*sorry for the technical difficulties in the last 10 minutes*\n\nOver the course of 4 years as a startup in the configuration management space, Opscode has seen a lot of code come and go.  We've just completed a full rewrite of the server side API from Ruby in Unicorn to Erlang in Webmachine, with amazing improvements in memory usage and concurrency.  I'll talk about why, for Opscode, Ruby is still the best choice on the client, but Erlang rules the server. \n\n\n\n\nLiked the song? It's \"Tank\" by Seatbelts"
