title: 'Continuous deployment in under 60 minutes with Octopus Deploy -  Damian Brady'
recordingDate: 1472751261
description: "Heard of Octopus Deploy but haven't had a chance to try it? Is your company using Octopus but you haven't explored it much yourself? Or are you an active user and want to learn some new tips and tricks? If deploying your app is harder than making a cup of coffee, this is a session you can't miss.\nStarting from scratch with fresh machines, we'll work our way towards a complete deployment automation pipeline for an example application. We'll install and configure the Octopus components, configure environments, set up projects, add deployment steps, and configure security. We'll even look at the API and how we can integrate with third party applications - everything you need for efficient and reliable end to end deployment. By the end of the session, we'll be deploying our app with a complete, working, continuous delivery pipeline.\n\nDespite being demo-centric, this session won't just be about the how. As we progress there'll be explanations of how and why Octopus works the way it does, and we'll discuss some of the DevOps best practices that drive the product. Whatever your exposure to Octopus Deploy, this session has something for you."
