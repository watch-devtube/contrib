description: "Java was recently hit by several major exploits. They were written in pure Java and relied on several obscure components of the Java library. Understanding how exploits undermine Java security is a fundamental step in understanding and improving Java security and producing secure Java code. Consequently, this session demonstrates and examines a public exploit. It dissects the code of the exploit and illustrates how the exploit managed to attack an unpatched Java Virtual Machine, focusing on the techniques the exploit used, with references to relevant guidelines from The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java. The session concludes with an explanation of how Java was patched to defeat the exploit.\n\n\nAuthors:\nDavid Svoboda\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by David Svoboda at https://www.parleys.com/author/david-svoboda-3\n\n Yozo Toda\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by  Yozo Toda at https://www.parleys.com/author/yozo-toda-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
