recordingDate: 1273256061
description: 'This webcast is a future-looking forecast about targeted attacks on identity, email, and data on the Internet. What happens when every ad doesn''t feel like spam because of increased information sharing and improving analytics? Spear phishing is the next-generation of e-mail phishing--except citizens, companies, and governments are the very precise targets with realistic ads.  In this webcast Jeff Jonas discusses what technology makes this possible, the recruitment for illegal activities (including corporate espionage), and how to avoid becoming a spear phishing victim.'
