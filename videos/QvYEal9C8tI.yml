title: 'Mikhail Novikov - GraphQL Clients'
language: English
recordingDate: 1530178503
description: "Single-page apps should be fast, and for that they usually need to cache their data on client side. Previously, we had to build those clients manually. With GraphQL, we can build clients that do lots of that manual work automatically and work with any GraphQL API.\n\nThis talk will explore why GraphQL makes it easy to build such clients. It'll start from describing how you would usually build a cache on client-side and how it's built in popular GraphQL clients. Talk will explore on what more can be done to build even more powerful tools and what a future GraphQL client would look like."
