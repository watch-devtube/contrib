recordingDate: 1505293763
description: "Sensors are being installed in more and more places, they are small and you might not even know that you are being registered. Data about you will be collected in more ways than you can imagine, and sometimes the data can give more personal information about you than you or the owner of the device had anticipated. Come and hear Johan talk about information revealed from the simplest of sensors, which might be on the edge of what you want people to know. He will also give you an overview of where the technology is today and share some of the other lessons learned while working with IoT devices. \n\nJohan Broddfelt works as a consultant and develops business applications. \n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
