description: "Deep Dive: containerd - Derek McGowan, Docker & Phil Estes, IBM Cloud \n\nCome learn about the internals of containerd that make it extensible, efficient, and stable. We will discuss the gRPC APIs used to communicate with containerd, the smart client model, the pluggable runtime interface, and the provided components that enable pulling, unpacking, and running a container image. For container runtime providers, learn about the v2 runtime shim API and integrating your own runtime. For those with custom storage needs, learn about developing plugins to build your own snapshotter and content store. We will include examples from CRI, Docker, and Moby’s buildkit.\n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GreP"
