description: "The days of maintaining systems by hand or as part of a large IT organization are clearly over. Today's infrastructure is dynamic, personalized and malleable. Users expect changes to take effect immediately, and to be able to effect much of those changes themselves. The next generation of system administrator (SysAdmin 3.0) needs to be an \"Infrastructure Engineer\". He needs to deploy, configure and maintain complex applications and services across a breadth of servers, clients, clouds, networked devices, tablets, smart-phones and toasters. She needs tools that empower her to acquire and express knowledge about systems in a scalable, comprehensive and agile way. CFEngine 3 is a framework designed to achieve precisely this.\n\nIn this webcast presentation Diego Zamboni , author of Learning CFEngine 3, will explore some of the basic concepts of CFEngine, and how it can help you in managing your IT infrastructure.\nAbout Diego Zamboni\n\nDiego Zamboni is a computer scientist, consultant, programmer, sysadmin, and overall geek who works as Senior Security Advisor at CFEngine AS.
