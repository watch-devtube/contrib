description: "by Stéphane Delcroix\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.3.201/dotnet_xaml_to_il.webm\n\n\nSome years ago we started to compile some bits of the Xamarin.Forms Xaml directly into IL. It’s now fully turned on into our templates, and on par with the runtime Xaml loader.\nIn this short talk you’ll learn about the story that got us there, about some of the internal cooking of Xamarin.Forms, and what our plans are for that Xaml compiler. \n\nRoom: K.3.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 14:30:00+01"
