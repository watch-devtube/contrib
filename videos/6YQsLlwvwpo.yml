title: 'TPS and TB - When to Scale Up and How to Scale Out'
recordingDate: 1421881202
description: "Originally aired on July 23, 2014.  With more people using more devices to access information via websites, mobile apps, social, video and tv, applications are under intense pressure to handle more transactions per second (TPS) and terabytes of data in real-time. But how much time is real-time? How many transactions per second (TPS) do applications really need? How do you balance price/performance with tiered storage - DRAM, flash and spinning disks - for gigabytes, terabytes and petabytes of data? When do you scale up and how do you scale out? This webcast will describe a number of real-time big data driven applications, emerging data management architectures and the increasing need for applications to handle mixed read/write workloads as well as transactions and analytics on \"hot\" data.\n\nAbout Brian Bulkowski\n\nBrian Bulkowski, founder & CTO of Aerospike has 20-plus years experience designing, developing and tuning networking systems and high-performance Web-scale infrastructures.
