description: "Mixed Reality: Merging the Virtual and the physical\n\nVirtual Reality is hot. Augmented Reality is hotter. Mixed Reality however is going the biggest thing we’ve seen in a long time. HoloLens was Microsoft’s answer to this new emerging industry. The device has wowed people all over the world, has won several awards and has been in the eye of a storm ever since it first was released. The new devices which are coming out this year and early next year will be amazing as well: finally we have an open eco-system in which a developer can create stunning and cool virtual realities with the skills he or she already possesses. All that is needed is some creativity and some knowledge. The creativity is something that you either have or don’t have. The knowledge however, is something we can provide. In this session Dennis will show you all you need to know to create great looking and awe-inspiring apps. We will talk about the basics, the ideas and of course do a live coding demo in which we’ll build a nice looking MR app right on stage!"
