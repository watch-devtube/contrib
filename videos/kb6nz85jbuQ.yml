description: "Are you tired of null pointer exceptions, unintended side effects, SQL injections, concurrency errors, mistaken equality tests, and other runtime errors? Are your users tired of them in your code? This presentation shows you how to guarantee, at compile time, that these runtime exceptions cannot occur. You have nothing to lose but your bugs!\n\n\nAuthor:\nWerner Dietl\nWerner Dietl is an assistant professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada.
