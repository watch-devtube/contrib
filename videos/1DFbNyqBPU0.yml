description: "Full title: Continuous delivery in 10 easy mistakes, and how to do better \n\nWith agile principles and practices reaching maturity, in many organizations the focus for the coming years will be on the next steps. Beyond agile. In fast pace organizations are adopting agile, DevOps, continuous delivery and new architectures such as microservices. Often all at once. Although from a perspective of similarities between these paradigms this makes sense, this also is a recipe for failures and hard lessons to be learned. Kim van Wilgen will share her experiences from the pipeline to the enterprise level and from failure to success."
