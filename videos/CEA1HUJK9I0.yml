description: "New advances and possibilities in the software industry have brought the focus back to continually growing data. Businesses are searching value in information that can be extracted from this data, using it to feed application functionalities that become smarter.\n\nThis implies analyzing enormous amounts of data continuously and often in real time. Several tools and frameworks can be used to distribute these analyses on different machines and probably in the cloud. Integrating results of this distributed realtime computation back in an application has become a challenge.\n\nThis talk will show how we can use Futures and Iteratees, concepts coming from functional programming paradigm, in Playframework, a web application framework designed for the cloud, to integrate distributed realtime data computation.\n\n\n\n\nLiked the song?
