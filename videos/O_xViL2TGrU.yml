description: "As developers, we use browser developer tools every day, but how often do we stop and think about how they work? \n\nThe secret is that browser developer tools are built with HTML, CSS, and JS and that any web developer can contribute to them. In this talk, we'll enter inspector inception and see how developer tools work from the inside out. In the process, we'll get a better understanding of how the tools we use every day work."
