title: 'Basejump: Build a Voting App'
language: English
recordingDate: 1437110905
description: "http://FreeCodeCamp.com is a community of busy people who learn to code by collaborating on projects for nonprofits. Learn Full-stack JavaScript, build a portfolio, and get great references with our online coding bootcamp.\n\nObjective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://votingapp.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.\n\nNote that for each Basejump, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-basejumps.\n\nAs you build your app, you should frequently commit changes to your codebase. You can do this by running git commit -am \"your commit message\". Note that you should replace \"your commit message\" with a brief summary of the changes you made to your code.\n\nYou can push these new commits to GitHub by running git push origin master, and to Heroku by running grunt --force && grunt buildcontrol:heroku.\n\nHere are the specific User Stories you should implement for this Basejump:\n\nUser Story: As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.\n\nUser Story: As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.\n\nUser Story: As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.\n\nUser Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.\n\nUser Story: As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.\n\nBonus User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can see everyone's polls, but I can't vote on anything.\n\nBonus User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)\n\nBonus User Story: As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.\n\nIf you need further guidance on using Yeoman Angular-Fullstack Generator, check out: https://github.com/clnhll/guidetobasejumps."
