description: 'The JVM is a remarkable piece of software that can do seemingly magical things with your code. Understanding these things is key to mastering the art of Java development allowing better and faster code that is easier to understand, test, and maintain. In this session, through a series of coding demonstrations, you will learn how to allocate standard Java objects on the stack rather than on the Java heap, how you should (and should not) test code performance, how to short-circuit Java Streams and gain massive performance, and how to create large aggregations Java collections such as List and Set without creating intermediary Java objects and holding terabytes of data in your JVM, without affecting garbage collection times.'
