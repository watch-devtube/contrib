recordingDate: 1462798687
description: "As we the transition to an internet of things society where software pervades all aspects of our lives, the consequences of faulty software are becoming more critical. There will be growing attention on who should be held accountable for harm caused by badly-designed code.\n\nWe will take a look at the near future of legal responsibility in software development. Will we see new, restrictive liability regimes imposed on IT vendors? Will individual developers be held criminally responsible for introducing bugs? Or can developers seize the initiative through codes of ethics and through technical solutions?"
