description: "Google Tech Talk\nNovember 12, 2012\n\nModerated by Brian Thomas, Associate Head of School and Head of the upper school at Bentley School in Lafayette, CA. \n\nABSTRACT\n\nASD, dyslexia, ADHD... hear from teens who are making their way in spite of learning differences.\n\nThis unique group of teens is passionate about learning differently, pursuing their fullest potential and spreading awareness of their capacity for academic and life success. They are members of S.A.F.E. Voices (Student Advisors for Education), a student community that strives to educate, mentor, and support students, parents, and teachers regarding the challenges and strengths of learning disabled and ADHD students.\n\nThe conversation covers everything from their initial personal experience of being diagnosed with a learning difference, understanding what accommodations they need to succeed, \"self-advocating\" with the dozens of teachers they've had over the years, and finding their unique strengths, to discussing their curiosity and passion for learning.\n\nS.A.F.E. Voices is a program of the Parents Education Network, a coalition of parents collaborating with educators, students, and the community to empower and bring academic success to students with learning and attention difficulties.
