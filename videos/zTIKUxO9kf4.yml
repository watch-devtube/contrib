title: 'An Overview of High Performance Computing and Challenges for the Future'
recordingDate: 1201346443
description: "Google Tech Talks\nJanuary, 25 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn this talk we examine how high performance computing has changed\nover the last 10-year and look toward the future in terms of trends.\nThese changes have had and will continue to have a major impact on our\nsoftware. A new generation of software libraries and algorithms are\nneeded for the effective and reliable use of (wide area) dynamic,\ndistributed and parallel environments. Some of the software and\nalgorithm challenges have already been encountered, such as management\nof communication and memory hierarchies through a combination of\ncompile--time and run--time techniques, but the increased scale of\ncomputation, depth of memory hierarchies, range of latencies, and\nincreased run--time environment variability will make these problems\nmuch harder.\n\nWe will focus on the redesign of software to fit multicore architectures.\n\nSpeaker: Jack Dongarra\nUniversity of Tennessee\nOak Ridge National Laboratory\nUniversity of Manchester\nJack Dongarra received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Chicago State University in 1972 and a Master of Science in Computer Science from the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1973. He received his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of New Mexico in 1980. He worked at the Argonne National Laboratory until 1989, becoming a senior scientist. He now holds an appointment as University Distinguished Professor of Computer Science in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at the University of Tennessee, has the position of a Distinguished Research Staff member in the Computer Science and Mathematics Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Turing Fellow in the Computer Science and Mathematics Schools at the University of Manchester, and an Adjunct Professor in the Computer Science Department at Rice University.\n\nHe specializes in numerical algorithms in linear algebra, parallel computing, the use of advanced-computer architectures, programming methodology, and tools for parallel computers. His research includes the development, testing and documentation of high quality mathematical software. He has contributed to the design and implementation of the following open source software packages and systems: EISPACK, LINPACK, the BLAS, LAPACK, ScaLAPACK, Netlib, PVM, MPI, NetSolve, Top500, ATLAS, and PAPI. He has published approximately 200 articles, papers, reports and technical memoranda and he is coauthor of several books. He was awarded the IEEE Sid Fernbach Award in 2004 for his contributions in the application of high performance computers using innovative approaches. He is a Fellow of the AAAS, ACM, and the IEEE and a member of the National Academy of Engineering."
