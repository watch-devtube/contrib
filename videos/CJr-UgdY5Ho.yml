description: "Collaboration is a key component of agile development, and one of its greatest challenges occurs when part of your team is located off-shore. We will discuss some techniques for improving trust and communication in order to collaborate more effectively across the whole team.\n\nThis talk will be of interest to those working with distributed and/or offshore team members who are looking for ideas to improve their way of working."
