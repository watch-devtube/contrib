description: "Undo for Service Brokers - Justin Carter & Dr Nic Williams, Stark & Wayne\n\nThe Cloud Foundry service api as an interface allows application developers to create, delete and update services that they want to consume in their applications. There is however no support for other important features of stateful services such as disaster-recovery or recreation of mistakenly deleted instances. \n\nIn this presentation Justin Carter will talk about how the api could be evolved to support more use cases in the future as well as how the existing api can be hacked to add support for ‘user-undo’ today as was done in dingo-postgresql, an open source service broker for clustered postgresql services.\n\nAbout Justin Carter\nAs a professional artist Justin Carter has performed as a musician and dancer in many prestigious festivals and venues. As a high stakes poker player he has faced former world champions. As a developer he has worked on algorithmic synthesizers, poker bots, game theoretical analysis tools and scheduling software for workforce management.\nCurrently he is a project lead at Stark & Wayne where he helps clients be successful in their adoption of Cloud Foundry and contributes to various projects in the Cloud Foundry open source ecosystem.\n\nAbout Dr Nic Williams\nCEO, Stark & Wayne\nDr Nic Williams has been working with, contributing to, documenting and teaching Cloud Foundry and BOSH since April 2012.
