description: 'All of you have been taught that GOOD code is Object Oriented. Why do you find so difficult to write distributed code? Why should be that hard to move a piece of code from the current machines to another? With this talk will explore what Object Oriented code is good and not good for, and why the node.js is an extremely good fit for microservices architectures.'
