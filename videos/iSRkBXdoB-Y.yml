recordingDate: 1484887578
description: "Kate Chapman\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/50/\nThe Cadasta Foundation create tech to allow communities to document their land rights. We are modivated by the fact that must of the world does not have legal rights to the land on which they live. Technology is only a small part of this larger social issue, but our hope is that tools can be part of the solution. By documenting evidence of indiviudal and community land rights it a piece of a process help groups obtain some level of legal recognition. The talk will go over:\r\n- Why land rights are important and the ways they improve the lives of marginalized people\r\n- The technology be used as part of this process (Python, Django, Postgres, Leaflet, Field Papers, OpenDataKit)\r\n- Pieces of code we are building that you might want to use in your applications\r\n- How Cadasta is gathering user feedback from users all over the world\r\n- What methods are being used to build a community around the open-source tools we are developing and how this is different from other land rights initiatives\r\n- How people can get involved with Cadasta as users, contributors or otherwise"
