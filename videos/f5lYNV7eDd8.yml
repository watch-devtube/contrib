No agenda, no topic... just thoughts. This video is the first episode of this series, in which Chris DiBona, our intrepid open source programs manager talks to Stephanie Liu of the Developer Team about his \"sweet goatee\" in the Chrome Comic. He also explains why Google open sourced Chrome and Android  and why we didn't do it sooner. He also touches on why much of Google's software isn't open sourced.\r\n\r\nIntros:\r\n\r\nChris DiBona is the open source programs manager at Google, where his team oversees license compliance and supports the open source developer community through the release of open source software projects and programs such as the Google Summer of Code. Before joining Google, Chris was an editor at Slashdot, has edited the books Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution and Open Sources 2.0: The Continuing Evolution and formerly co-hosted the FLOSS weekly with Leo Laporte.
