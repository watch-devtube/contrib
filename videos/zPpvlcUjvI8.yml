description: "Speaker: TIM BEGIN TECHNICAL ARCHITECT CONSULTANT\nWhile the Spring Framework can improve the speed and stability of application development in many areas, it can also be a daunting ecosystem to navigate for both novice and experienced development teams as they adjust to Framework improvements and industry changes. Tim Begin has spent over a decade leading and mentoring teams in refactoring and developing Spring applications. This session will explore current industry concepts (or buzzwords), fact based observations of common mistakes and misunderstandings these teams have shown using Java, Spring and Cloud Foundry and diving into examples of using and extending the framework to provide a data service solutions without duplicating the functionality Spring provides."
