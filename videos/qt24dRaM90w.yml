title: 'ODF: Great standard, but what works?'
recordingDate: 1484965390
description: "Ben Martin\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/85/\nODF is an open standard for storing office documents like\r\ntext, spreadsheets, drawings, and presentations.While ODF1.2\r\nhas been a standard for years, most tools do not fully\r\nimplement the entire specification. See how many current\r\ngeneration office suites implement and or ignore the features\r\nof the ODF specification. I'll also cover some open source\r\ntools which you can use to check how well your own documents\r\nare preserved across many different office suites. Some\r\nresults are available at\r\nhttp://autotests.opendocumentformat.org/\r\n \r\nI have been working on tools to help you work out what is\r\nsupported by each office application and see how a document\r\nis presented on a platform that you do not have access to.\r\nodfautotests runs hundreds of tests that have been derived \r\nfrom the ODF standard, with each test aimed at showing how well each office application preserves a specific attribute or element of the ODF standard. \r\n\r\nSo for example you can see at a glance what\r\noffice application will throw away ruby text, and also see\r\nhow the ruby text is presented. While you might not care\r\nabout ruby text, returning an updated document to a Japanese\r\nclient with it stripped out will likely lead to tension.\r\nodfserver is a new tool created this year to allow files to\r\nbe uploaded to a central server and have numerous office\r\napplications load and save each file to test compatibility. \r\n\r\nThese testing tools are useful for a few groups of people. End users looking to use ODF and knowing what is properly perserved in their document. Small tests showing failing attributes are gold for developers who can then formulate plans as to which parts of the specification should be supported by their project next."
