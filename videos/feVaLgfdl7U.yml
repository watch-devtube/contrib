description: "The ABC, Australia's national public broadcaster, recently launched a new transcoding system that converts media into suitable formats for the catch-up tv service, iview. It is cost-efficient, scalable, and has successfully processed thousands of pieces of content since going live in December 2015.\nMetro has been built using golang, node.js, and ffmpeg, and heavily utilises a variety of AWS technology including queues, varied capacity autoscaling, hosted database servers, and notifications.\nThis talk will cover Metro's system architecture, how we transcode content, technical challenges we faced, and what we'd like to achieve in future.\n\nDaphne Chong is a Technical Lead in the API and Backend Services team at the ABC, responsible for building Metro and other APIs used by mobile apps and websites. Daphne has worked as a software developer for over a decade and previously lived in the UK. She is an organiser for Women Who Code Sydney and loves to tinker with things in her spare time.\n\nNick McHardy is a Solution Designer for the ABC's Digital Network. At the ABC, Nick has designed content recommendations, media transcoding and digital analytics solutions amongst others. Nick loves tech, enjoys building systems and hosts a weekly fusion jazz show on community radio.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
