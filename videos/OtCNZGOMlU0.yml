description: 'Many people underestimate the DevOps shift required for running applications in the cloud rather than on-premises. Truly cloud-native applications on Java EE are possible with very little effort, but a shift in mindset is required to really take advantage of the scale that comes with cloud deployments. In this tutorial, the presenters build a full microservice using Java EE APIs, JAX-RS, EJB, CDI, and JPA. They then demonstrate the use of various tools such as Docker, Vagrant, and Amazon Web Services, showing elasticity and resilience, making use of features that are infeasible or not easy with on-premises deployments, and demonstrating 12-factor-app principles and how they can be applied to Java EE deployments.'
