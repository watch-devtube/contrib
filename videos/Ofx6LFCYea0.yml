description: "The modern front-end developers use many tools to structure and improve their applications ; frameworks – like React and Angular, one-way data flow architectures like Redux and even supersets of JavaScript like TypeScript.\n\nBut what if we could rethink JavaScript from zero and create a language that is perfectly suited for actual front-end development, integrating all the good practices we’ve discovered in our search for quality?\n\nThat’s what Elm is, a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. Its main strengths? The compiler error messages are limpid, performance is impressive and above all, you’ll never see a runtime error again.\n\nYou can forget undefined is not a function! In short: if it compiles, it works!\n\nLet’s discover what makes this language one of the most productive and pleasant to use that I know, by discovering its syntax and live-coding a mini-game entirely in Elm!\n\n# Jordane Grenat\nWeb Application Developer and Craftsman.\n\nPassionated about web technologies, I am really interested about Elm and the JavaScript ecosystem (new EcmaScript versions, SPA frameworks, tooling, ...)"
