description: "Data is overwhelming us both in terms of size and speed. How do we deal with these huge amount of real-time, streaming data? We need to combine tools, platform, patterns, and principles to overcome this situation.\n\nJoin on us this session where we’ll identify critical patterns and principles that enable us to achieve greater scale and responde speed. We’ll provide you with a live demo demonstrating how an In-Memory Data Grid like Infinispan and a platform like Kubernetes can leverage these patterns and principles creating a state-of-the-art distributed data processing architecture."
