description: "Reactive programming has changed the way we develop modern applications. If you are a Java backend developer you might be already familiar with this paradigm and the new Spring 5 support. But what about the frontend? We want to build clean, testable, and scalable apps. The good news is that we can reuse the knowledge, the concepts are universal.\n\nIn this presentation we’ll introduce the fundamentals of RxJS and see how to manage data streams like UI events, async HTTP requests, WebSockets / SSE…in a uniform way. Let RxJS do the heavy lifting.\n\nAngular embraces and makes heavy use of RxJS, we’ll see how to use them together with practical examples on common problems.\n\nSergi Almar, Spring Certified Instructor, Independent\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
