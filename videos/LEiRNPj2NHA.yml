description: "Java 4..12, Kotlin, Code Coverage and their best friend — bytecode: scandals, intrigues, investigations\nby Evgeny Mandrikov\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.119/kotlin_code_coverage_bytecode.webm\n\n\nDo you know what is inside of your class files? Are you ready to bet? Let's have fun by diving into bytecode pattern matching and explore how different compilers (Java/Kotlin) and their different versions, including unreleased javac 12, transform your source code. \n\nOur dive will be based on details of implementation of most popular open source code coverage tool for Java — JaCoCo, whose recently released version finds in bytecode and filters out various compiler generated artifacts, which otherwise require unnecessary and sometimes impossible tricks to have full code coverage. \n\nRoom: UD2.119\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 15:20:00+01"
