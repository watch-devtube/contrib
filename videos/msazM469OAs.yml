description: "One App, Two Platforms, Three Cloud Services - Sam Gunaratne, Pivotal & Georgi Lozev, SAP\n\nThe Open Service Broker API gives developers the power to consume services from different cloud providers on different cloud platforms. This talk will show the power of this specification in action. We will show a single application deployed to Cloud Foundry that uses a service from Google Cloud, a service from Microsoft Azure and a service from IBM Cloud. We will then take the same application and deploy it to Kubernetes and use the same set of services.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyZ/one-app-two-platforms-three-cloud-services-sam-gunaratne-pivotal-georgi-lozev-sap"
