description: "Let's cut through the hype and understand Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) by creating one ourselves programmatically! We'll first learn about Bitcoin & Ethereums architecture to prepare us for the smart contract creation process. Our DemoCoin ICO will be built using tools from the Ethereum developer ecosystem. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/what_is_an_initial_coin_offering\n\nAlberto's Winning Code:\nhttps://github.com/alberduris/The_Math_of_Intelligence/tree/master/Week10\n\nEric's 2nd place Code:\nhttps://github.com/EricAlcaide/Math_of_Intelligence/tree/master/Quantum_Computing\n\nPlease Subscribe!
