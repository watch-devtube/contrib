description: "Public speaking. Team management. Efficiency. Problem Solving. Leadership. All these terms commonly refer to the workplace, and for most people, they are a challenge.\nThese same words apply to the orchestra. Musicians deal with and solve these issues on a daily basis. What can we learn from them?\n\nAn orchestra is usually given as the perfect example of harmony. Very different instruments, sometimes very far from one another, a different music sheet, and yet, unity is achieved. Music is made, and it’s beautiful. Achieving this harmony is not easy, and requires a lot of work from everyone. Being a good musician is not enough. Being able to listen to the other musicians, focusing, following the conductor during rehearsals and on concert night, managing stage fright; all these steps are necessary, and by no means easy. Yet, musicians do it every day. The qualities they develop can be transferred to the work place: solving conflicts, overcoming the fear of public speaking, managing opposite points of view and personalities, creating a positive relationship between a manager and his team… There is lot to learn from the orchestra!"
