description: "??ATTENTION ??\nRegistration to ?DevTernity 2018 is running:\n? https://devternity.com\n\nDid you know that Netflix has now fully transitioned to the cloud. Ever wonder how you could do the same or sell it to your boss/clients/your pet? Do you often wonder how to chose the best provider out of all the different players in the market. Well wonder no more. Join Paul as he guides you through how to build infrastructure on 2 different platforms. Watch as he uses both AWS and Azure to show you easy it is using the principles of infrastructure as code. By the end of this session, you will have enough guidance and confidence to start automating your own infrastructure and be less afraid of that big bogeyman VENDOR LOCKIN."
