title: '"How to Write a Retro Arcade Emulator" - Josh Bassett (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579213081
description: "Josh Bassett\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/53/\n\nIf you were a kid during the 70s, 80s, or 90s, the chances are you spent time (and money) in your local video arcade playing games. Later, the rise of home video game consoles sadly brought an end to the golden era of video arcades – the rows of machines crafted out of plywood and vintage electronics, abandoned for the quiet comfort of our living rooms.\r\n\r\nNot only did we lose the visceral experience of the video arcades, but we also lost our appreciation for the engineering wizardry that went into building these great machines. In this talk, Josh takes a look at the hardware engineering behind one of his favourite games of the 1980s, and shows you how to build an emulator to preserve a little piece of gaming history.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
