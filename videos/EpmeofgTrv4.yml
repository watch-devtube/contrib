description: "In this session from AppForum 2012, Bhanu Morampudi of Kutir Technologies discusses some starting points, tools, and development resources such as jQueryMobile, jQMobi, & Sencha Touch for building great user interfaces for enterprise applications.\n\nWith complete control over the UI and UX, developers will give end users identical application experiences across all operating systems and devices. The application will scale from screen size to screen size without the need to re-write or re-learn anything, and will also look and feel much like a consumer app.\n\nFor more videos from AppForum 2012, head to http://mrkn.co/kx1dp"
