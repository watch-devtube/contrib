description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nFine-tuning machine learning models (hyperparameter tuning) is crucial but tedious. Fortunately, optimization promises to automate this task. We give an overview on algorithms for this task and explain their inner workings. To help you selecting one for your project, we benchmark implementations in Python against human experts. We link to the discussion on automating machine learning in general.\n\nSlide: https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/towards-automating-machine-learning-benchmarking-tools-for-hyperparameter-tuning-dr-thorben-jensen\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
