description: "Domain Adaptation Workshop: Theory and Application at NIPS 2011 \r\nInvited Talk: Training Structured Prediction Models with Extrinsic Loss Functions by Slav Petrov\r\n\r\nSlav Petrov is a Research Scientist at Google New York who works on problems at the intersection of natural language processing and machine learning. In particular, he's  interested in syntactic parsing and its applications to machine translation and information extraction. \r\n\r\nAbstract: \r\nWe present an online learning algorithm for training structured prediction models with extrinsic loss functions. This allows us to extend a standard supervised learning objective with additional loss-functions, either based on intrinsic or task-specific extrinsic measures of quality. We present experiments with sequence models on part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition tasks, and with syntactic parsers on dependency parsing and machine translation reordering tasks."
