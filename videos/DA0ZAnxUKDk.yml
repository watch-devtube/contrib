There must be a better way.\n\nIn this second episode of root access Berlin, Mustafa Sezgin explains the principles of Reactive Programming. He and his team at SoundCloud have been refactoring several UI elements of the SoundCloud Android application using the RxJava library built by Netflix engineers.\n\nFollow-up links:\n\nMartin Görner: http://plus.google.com/+MartinGorner\nMustafa Sezgin: https://soundcloud.com/mufaasa\nRxJava: https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava\n\nroot access Berlin is recorded at the new studio at the Factory in Berlin.
