We may dispute the number, but it is clear that the Internet of Things (IoT) will produce a colossal amount of data.\n\nOur social networks collect masses of data and so do the sensor networks that blanket our cities and everywhere else—from outer space down to our personal items. Before we can even figure out how huge data can translate to information, via context, people are already declaring a state of surveillance capitalism running our lives. The question of privacy looms large. Is it hypocrisy? What would happen if big data were open data?\n\nAbout Alicia Asin (Libelium):\nAlicia Asín is CEO and co-founder of Libelium, the wireless sensor hardware provider, creators of Waspmote, a modular, open source sensor platform for the Internet of Things (IoT).
