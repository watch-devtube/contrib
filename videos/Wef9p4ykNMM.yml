recordingDate: 1474421546
description: 'Since the early-access releases of Java 9 became available, the Apache Maven team has been testing this product and enhancing its build management tool to support the new features. Especially the modular system described in JSR 376 requires changes to adopt this specification. The Maven team is involved in the discussions about the refinements of these specifications to improve the adoption of the modular system. This session highlights the JEPs and JSRs that are now supported by Maven and what they mean for all Maven projects. The speaker has been a PMC member and committer of the Apache Maven project since 2011. He has implemented most of the changes required to adopt Java 9/Jigsaw and maintains contact with the related Oracle teams.'
