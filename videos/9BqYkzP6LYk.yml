description: "Google Tech Talks\nAugust 27, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nModel-based testing can help to reduce the cost of testing and increase its effectiveness. Instead of designing test cases by hand, model-based testing allows a test engineer to automatically generate test cases from a model of the system under test.\n\nAfter a brief overview of model-based testing, this talk will compare two different kinds of test model: black-box models and white-box models. Black-box models are easier for programmers to write and tools to use, while white-box models require more sophisticated notations and modelling skills, but can allow more sophisticated test generation.\n\nThese two styles of models will be illustrated by using..."
