description: "How can we build websites with scalable development (autonomous teams), great end-user performance and high future evolvability?\n\nWith this talk, I want to show you that server-side transclusion – in particular Edge Side Includes – is a great integration technique for the above goals. Teams can produce pages and/or fragments, and fragments in turn depend on resource fragments for styles and (possibly) scripts. But how should teams agree on common dependencies and what would the existence of common dependencies mean to evolvability and performance?\n\nExamples will be from the mobile web project IKEA M2.\n\nKey takeaways\nThe benefits of microservices apply to the frontend as well.\nThe constraints are bit different though since part of the runtime is a diverse set of end-user devices.\nEdge Side Includes is a highly underrated technology for web frontend integration.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
