title: 'YOW! Connected 2017 - Sam Ritchie - Using the Elm Architecture in Swift'
recordingDate: 1510282800
description: "Elm, for a long time the flag bearer of Functional Reactive Programming on the web, recently switched to a simpler pure functional architecture, citing 'ease of use'. Those of us that have worked on complex RxSwift/ReactiveCocoa apps can sympathise with this - using FRP injudiciously in your app can make the code difficult to understand and near impossible for new developers to pick up.\nSo are we able to apply some of the techniques and patterns from Elm into Swift iOS apps? It turns out the Elm architecture is a really great fit for Swift - it allows us to:\n    reserve our FRP hammer for the use cases that make the most sense\n    separate out a simple, consistent, and highly testable pure functional core, and\n    provide a flexible, yet easily understood & applied set of architectural building blocks.\nThis session will cover the basics of implementing and using an Elm-style architecture in a Swift app, will include lessons learnt in a real-world implementation, pitfalls/benefits, and implementation considerations should you adopt the approach in your own app.\n\nSam has a background in .NET enterprise development, but now works mainly on mobile apps & cloud services. He’s been an Apple fanboy since the 80s, and was coding Objective-C before it was cool. He mainly develops in Swift, Elm & F# these days, and actively tries to avoid writing any JavaScript.\n\nSam runs the Perth-based software consulting company codesplice, and organises the Perth iOS developers meetup group.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
