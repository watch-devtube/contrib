recordingDate: 1523549570
description: "An effective testing strategy demands many tools in our tool belts. Let’s take a look at some tests, environments, and tools for Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Drupal 8:\n\n\nBehavior-Driven Development (BDD) ensures the application functions as we are intending, and serves as documentation. We’ll look at leveraging existing Behat definitions and explore opportunities to compose our own.\n\nVisual regression testing is great for ensuring your site keeps looking the way it is supposed to when changes are introduced.\n\nUnit testing is fast, cheap, and perfect for testing granular functions. We can also extend Drupal classes to test the Kernel, Browser, and JavaScript bases.\n\nWe’ll walk through creating, debugging, and improving our test coverage to deliver quality. To get the most out of this session you should have a basic understanding of Drupal site building, development, and Object Oriented PHP. You’ll emerge from this session with a solid understanding of the elements that make up a sweet test suite!"
