title: 'Learn about Efficient Functional IO in Scala (presentation from Northeast Scala Symposium)'
recordingDate: 1333653262
description: "IO is the trickiest of operations to tackle in a functional way. Try to make IO efficient, non-leaky, composable, and pure, and the problem becomes virtually unsolvable. \n\nIn this talk, John A. De Goes, CTO at Precog, discusses three different approaches to functional IO in Scala, beginning with iteratees, and continuing on to stream processors and transducers.\n\n** Videos sponsored by Typesafe (http://typesafe.com) and Marakana.\n**"
