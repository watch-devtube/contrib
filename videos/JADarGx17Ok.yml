description: "We, Anna and Britt, are co-founders of London-based book publishing business, Visual Editions. We believe that books should be as visually interesting as the stories they tell and experiences they give. We call it visual writing. An our strap line is 'Great looking stories.'\n\nAnna Gerber\n\nVisual Editions\n\nAnna Gerber co-founded and runs Visual Editions (publishers of Jonathan Safran Foer's Tree of Codes) with Britt Iversen. Anna comes from Paris via Los Angeles and has been writing about, working in and teaching graphic design for the past ten years, first at Central Saint Martins and now at London College of Communication. She has an MA in Philosophy, but doesn't use it all that often. She lives in Paddington with Nick and their daughter Bella.\n\nBritt Iversen\n\nVisual Editions\n\nBritt Iversen co-founded and runs Visual Editions (a company formed from the love of books and a mischievous desire to do things differently) with Anna Gerber. Britt is from Copenhagen and has been working in advertising, via brand communication and research, for fifteen years, the last nine years at Mother London. She lives in South London with Nigel and their two kids, Rasmus and Millie."
