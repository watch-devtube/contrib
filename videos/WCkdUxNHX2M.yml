description: "Fast, Available, Catastrophically Failing? Safely Avoiding Behavioral Incidents in Complex Production Systems\n\nRamin Keene\n\nOperators are increasingly being asked to release and manage services that behave in ways that are increasingly difficult to reason about compared to traditional application services. Data products, model based machine learning services, ensemble models, and large microservices architectures are founded on deliberate complexity in such a way that their availability is only correctly measured via an SLA/QOS around their behavior, but also threatened by the unknown unknowns emergent behavior from their interactions.\n\nIncidents move from being about general service availability, to behavioral.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Europe/Middle East/Africa Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/program \n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
