description: "With Xamarin now free for everyone, the popularity of the cross-platform framework is increasing rapidly. We致e now had the time to play around with it, now the time has come to build serious apps with it.\nIn this session, you値l learn how a real-world Xamarin application architecture is built, with an emphasis on testability and maintainability. The app we値l look at is called MyTrains, an application used to book train journeys.\n\nYou値l see an architecture that has proven itself over different projects already. The architecture is using the MvvmCross framework. You値l see how the architecture is built from the ground up, starting with model, the repositories and the services. On top of that, we値l build the view models which will be used by the views in the iOS and Android apps. Along the way, you値l see how MvvmCross uses data binding and commanding and how navigation is handled in MVVM\n\nYou値l walk away with an example of how real applications in Xamarin should be built. You値l be able to use this as your starting point for your next Xamarin application."
