description: "See a professional front-end developer at work. Unscripted. Mistakes included.\n\nWatch me set up a DigitalOcean droplet that will run run Ubuntu, Node, Express, React via Next.js and Nginx as a reverse proxy. I will also eventually secure the server using LetsEncrypt.\n\nUPDATE: Toward the end of the video, I run the command: sudo pm2 startup systemd. This was a mistake. Run it without the sudo and follow the instructions given in the output. If you did follow my video instructions, just use: sudo pm2 unstartup systemd. This will undo everything and you can type the command correctly.\n\nDigital Ocean Guides:\nUbuntu 16.04: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04\nNginx: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-16-04\nNodeJS: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-16-04\n\nRepo: https://github.com/fus-marcom/ci-react\n\nReact: https://facebook.github.io/react/\nNext.js: https://github.com/zeit/next.js/ \nMaterialize: http://materializecss.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/JesseRWeigel\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/c/JesseWeigel29 \n\nCode Editor: https://atom.io/\nTerminal: https://www.iterm2.com/\nProject Management: https://trello.com\n\n-\n\nWe're busy people who learn to code, then practice by building projects for nonprofits.
