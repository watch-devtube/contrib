description: "http://www.oscon.com\r\n\r\nJohn Jacobsen is a software consultant based in Chicago, IL. He studied art and physics at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison, where he did his doctoral research on the simulation of neutrino detectors. His company, NPX Designs, specializes in software for large-scale science projects, and has done work ranging from Linux device driver development to interactive Web site development for experimental control and scientific visualization. He has also exhibited artwork  in half a dozen states across the USA, and created one of the first Web sites for presenting artwork (Jan. 1994). John is gearing up for his ninth and probably last trip to the South Pole, where he will help to finish commissioning the world's largest neutrino detector, IceCube."
