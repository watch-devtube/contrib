description: "One of the best experiences you might have as a developer is when you are running your continuous delivery pipeline and one of the test failed because it has found a bug. At this point you see that thanks of your tests you are producing a less buggy software. This should be the normal case, in green field projects, but unlikely to happen when running legacy code with a lot of untested code.\n\nCome to this session to learn how you can use Docker for developing tests for code that never had any automatic test before\n\nKey takeaways\nHow to start writing tests for legacy code\nYou'll learn how to use Docker and Arquillian Cube to write tests for legacy code.\nTests enable you to change your code. No tests means that every time you change something\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
