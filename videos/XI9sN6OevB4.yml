title: 'YOW! 2011 Dan Ingalls - The Live Web'
language: English
recordingDate: 1499696063
description: "The Lively Kernel showed that one could build a self-supporting development environment using only JavaScript and browser graphics. This kernel can be stored simply as a web page, and can come to life in any browser with no installation or plugins. Recent progress in the Lively Kernel platform enables drag-and-drop composition of active content from shared cloud-based repositories, empowering web developers and end-users alike. Attendees will learn from live examples of fun and useful web authoring and will leave with free and full access to all the tools shown.\n\nDan Ingalls is the principal architect of five generations of Smalltalk environments. He designed the byte-coded virtual machine that made Smalltalk practical in 1976. He later conceived a Smalltalk written in itself and made portable and efficient by a Smalltalk-to-C translator, now known as the Squeak open-source Smalltalk. Dan also invented BitBlt, the general-purpose graphical operation that underlies most bitmap graphics systems today, as well as pop-up menus. His most recent work, the Lively Kernel, is a dynamic graphics and programming environment that runs entirely in a browser. Able to save its results and even new versions of itself as web pages, if offers the promise that wherever there is the web there is authoring. Dan received his B.A. in Physics from HarvardUniversity, and his M.S. in Electrical Engineering from StanfordUniversity. He is a recipient of the ACM Grace Hopper Award, and the ACM Software Systems Award. Dan has recently joined SAP and is a member of the Chief Scientist team guiding the company's technology vision, direction and execution.\n\nFor more on YOW!
