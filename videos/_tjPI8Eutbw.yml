title: 'Erik Hellman - Android and the WebView'
recordingDate: 1555659566
description: "While the native widgets for Android are extremely powerful and cover most of the use cases we can imagine, there are still some areas where web content is our only option. That means we need to embed a WebView in our application and create a bridge between the native code and the JavaScript running on the web page we load.\n\nIn this session you will learn everything there is about how to deal with the WebView on Android. Learn how to properly load content, inject your own CSS or JavaScript, how to effectively communicate between JavaScript and Android, and how to make loading web content secure in Android applications. We will also look at how to implement some common use cases, like displaying ePub and other HTML-based e-books."
