description: "Are you ready to continuously deploy every commit to production and deploy 25 times a day? Can your operations team tear down and spin up VMs and containers for your app like they're nothing? Can your company track production usage and toggle features at the whims of the marketing department? No?\nWe all know it's not quite that easy. You can't take an existing house-of-cards monolith and just start treating it like a unicorn, as much as everyone would like to. But as a developer, you can start to make practical inroads, and you can do it now.\n\nThis talk looks at DevOps culture from the point of view of a developer - how code changes can affect the agility of your organisation. We'll discuss architectural changes, design techniques, deployment pipelines, and how to make large changes safely. Developers at any level will leave with some practical ways to support your company's DevOps efforts and start working better with your ops team."
