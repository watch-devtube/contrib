description: "Developers can learn more about the Google Maps API at http://goo.gl/58Hk5\nPresenters: Francesc Campoy Flores, Kurt Schwehr, Mano Marks \n\nTens of thousands of ships report their position at least once every 5 minutes, 24 hours a day. Visualizing that quantity of data and serving it out to large numbers of people takes lots of power both in the browser and on the server. This session will explore the use of Maps, App Engine, Go, Compute Engine, BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and WebGL to do massive data visualization.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
