description: "by Axel Hecht\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.208/continuous_localization.webm\n\n\nLocalization at Mozilla happens in a tight loop between development and localizer involvement. We're going to show how this works on Firefox for Desktop, and how it works for our Android projects. We show how we get to multiple testable builds a day, and how we mitigate the bad parts. \n\nRoom: UD2.208 (Decroly)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 10:30:00+01"
