recordingDate: 1321053088
description: 'In an increasingly complex digital environment, end-user experience must be monitored exhaustively. We can''t focus only on external website performance. End-user experience must be addressed through active & passive technologies covering all B2C & B2B usages (data, voice, video), whatever the context (mobile, cloud, within or outside the firewall). ip-label will illustrate via real customer cases how they provide the largest portfolio of end-user monitoring solutions in the Application Performance Management industry.'
