description: '#Codemotion Rome 2017 - Big Data is key for innovation in many industries today. Large amounts of historical data are stored and analyzed in Hadoop, Spark or other clusters to find patterns, e.g. for predictive maintenance or cross-selling. However: How do you increase revenue or reduce risks in new transactions proactively? Stream processing is the solution to embed patterns into future actions in real-time. This session discusses and demos how machine learning and analytic models with R, Spark MLlib, H2O, etc. can be build and integrated into real-time event processing frameworks. The session focuses on live demos'
