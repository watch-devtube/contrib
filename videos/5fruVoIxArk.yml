description: "Technology Transformation: How Team Values Boost Customer Value\n\nOpal Perry, Divisional CIO, Claims, Allstate Insurance\n\nAt Allstate, the largest publicly held personal lines property and casualty insurer in America, we constantly innovate for the good of our customers. It’s part of who we are and the legacy we’ve been building since 1931. Recently, we set about recasting the organization's technical and engineering discipline to make it core to the company, and moving technology up the value chain. But technology is just one piece of the transformation. Opal will discuss how an explicit focus on culture and values, together with new ways of working, empower product teams and bring valuable technology to customers with greater speed and agility.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
