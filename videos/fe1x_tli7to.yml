description: "Sharing of photos has become one of the primary ways for people to communicate. Billions of photos are uploaded on Facebook every single day. Such a large scale makes it challenging to sift through and find photos a person is interested in. To help people find the photos they’re looking for more easily, it becomes crucial to match their search queries with the right photos to satisfy search intent. This requires a deep understanding of both the photos as well as queries in multiple languages. \n\nIn this talk, we will present an overview of the infrastructure as well as machine learning models powering Facebook’s image search system.\n\nEVENT:\n\nMLConf 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nFedor Borisyuk, Technical Leader in the Domain of Computer Vision at Facebook\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nMLConf provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nMLConf YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjeM1xxYb_37bZfyparLS3Q"
