Strata and Tableau Public, a free tool for creating interactive online visualizations, have had hundreds of bloggers striving to win their Interactive Public Data Visualization Contest. Come see the best of the best from the contest, and the official announcement of the winner.\n\nElissa Fink\n\nTableau Software\n\nElissa Fink is Tableau Software's CMO. A true data geek, Elissa has been helping companies improve their marketing operations through applied data analysis for 20+ years. She has held executive positions in marketing, business strategy, product management, and product development. Elissa first discovered Tableau late one afternoon at her previous company. Three hours later, she was still \"at play\" with her data. \"After just a few minutes using the product, I was getting answers to questions that were taking my previous company's programmers weeks to create. It was instantly obvious that Tableau was on a special mission with something unique to offer the world. I just had to be a part of it.\" Elissa is a graduate of Santa Clara University and holds an MBA in Marketing and Decision Systems from the University of Southern California."
