description: "Intro: Kubernetes SIG Multicluster - Daneyon Hansen, Cisco, Quinton Hoole & Irfan Ur Rehman, Huawei \n\nSIG-Multicluster is focused on solving common challenges related to the management of multiple Kubernetes clusters, and applications that exist therein. We are responsible for designing, discussing, implementing and maintaining API’s, tools and documentation related to multi-cluster administration and application management. This includes not only active automated approaches such as Cluster Federation, but also those that employ batch workflow-style continuous deployment systems like Spinnaker and others. Standalone building blocks for these and other similar systems (for example a cluster registry), and proposed changes to kubernetes core where appropriate are in scope. In this intro we will give you an overview of the projects we're currently actively working on, how best to get involved, and what our future plans look like. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/Grbw"
