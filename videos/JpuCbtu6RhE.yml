For example, predictive models are often used to detect crimes and identify suspects, after the crime has taken place.  \n\nEdureka's Advanced Predictive Modelling in R course will cover different concepts of predictive modelling and almost all the forms of regression analysis with application. You will learn regression in detail including detailed understanding of various regression techniques using case studies. Also, you will be introduced to various other regression techniques which are used in industry. Overall, you will gain expertise in predictive modelling and forecasting. You will also get to implement one project towards the end of the course.                                     \n\nThe Topics covered in the webinar are:\n\n1.Advanced Predictive Modelling in R\n2. Introduction to Predictive Modelling\n3.Beyond OLS: How real life data-set looks like!\n4.decoding Forecasting\n5.How to Handle real life dataset: Two examples\n6.How to Build Models in R: Example\n7.Forecasting techniques and Plots\n\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would\nprefer a hassle free and self paced learning environment, accessible from any part of the world.\n\nThe topics related to ' Introduction to Predictive Modelling ' have extensively been covered in our course ' Advanced Predictive Modelling in R ’.\n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India: +91-8880862004"
