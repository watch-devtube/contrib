title: 'EdgeConf 4: Package Management'
language: English
recordingDate: 1412353244
description: 'The web lives and breathes code sharing and reuse, and web components take us increasingly into the territory of abstracted reusable code. We need a package manager for the web. Is bower gradually becoming the ''official'' solution for this, and is anyone fed up with putting seven different package manager configs in their open source repos yet?'
