Is software testing a technical problem to be solved by engineering solutions? What exactly is the goal of testing? What can you do to become a world-class tester?\n\nA world-class tester understands that we are confronted with a techno-human system and that our goal as testers is to extract and deliver information about the product in a way that help stakeholders to make the right decisions. Having said that, it does not make a lot of sense to distinguish between manual and automated testing as this categorization is not very helpful.\n\nIlari Henrik Aegerter presents a model of software testing that takes both engineering and social aspects into consideration. A lively discussion during the presentation is very welcome."
