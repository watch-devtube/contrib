description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotjs.io on December 1st in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nOne of the primary goals for testing software is to have confidence that your software works as intended, but this doesn't give much insight into the quality of the software. Is it performant? How about accessible? Are we sending too much code? Answering these questions in an automated fashion today is hard, but that will be changing in the future.\n\nIn this talk, Trent explores how recent changes in technology give us a foundation to start answering the questions posed above and so much more. He looks at a near future where we have confidence that our software is functional and works well."
