description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nMicroservices are not news anymore. They allow multiple teams to work autonomously by choosing their own technology stacks and having their own release cycles. There is something not being addressed though, like if it is some kind of dirty little secret, and that is frontend development. The common practice for building websites remains 'the monolith': a single frontend codebase that consumes multiple APIs."
