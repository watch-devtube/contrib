title: 'Brian Duggan - "Extending Perl 6 Command Line Argument Parsing using Metaprogramming"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1498109520
description: "Perl 6 has amazing built-in features for writing command-line utilities. But sometimes even those aren't enough. In this talk, we push it further to allow features such as subcommands, command-specific help and interleaved positional and named arguments. We use metaprogramming to look up dispatch tables for multi-candidates, scrutinize signatures, and query POD declarator blocks. We show how integration with command line argument parsing is a practical application of Perl 6's rich meta-object protocol.\n\n\nBrian has been an open source software author for over 20 years. His interests include math, chess, linked data, and writing code in Perl 5 and 6."
