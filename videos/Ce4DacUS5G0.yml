description: "From Big Data to Global Lean Application Platform - Our Journey to Cloud Foundry - Olivier Brun, Orange & Alexandre Vasseur, Pivotal\n\nOrange Group has mandate to setup large innovative solutions to support all countries and business needs. It covers platform think, build and run both as one central or several country level instantiations while keeping homogeneity and reducing costs and snowflakes.\n\nAs part of a global cloud native transformation across Orange countries, businesses and IT teams - OLAF Orange Lean Application Facilities was launched and encompasses topics from CI/CD developer ecosystem tools to actual big data, NoSQL and cloud native platform.\n\nAdopting Cloud Foundry as a part of it immediately made sense - as long as the underlying larger strategic streams could be mapped for the long term:\n- developer onboarding and project facilitation for several thousands of them\n- rich catalog of service with a mix of build, buy & integrate strategy\n- operational excellence for keeping the platform and apps running at scale on private cloud\n- vendor neutrality and skill center development\n- innovation acceleration for cloud native, microservices and container-first architecture\n- simple rollout of a reference architecture at global scale\n\nCome hear about our journey to start and measure success in transforming Orange Group how we leveraged and expanded the specifics of Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Pivotal DOJOs implementation approach and the Cloud Foundry partner ecosystem to rollout OLAF with developer-efficiency, secure-first, global-ready and automate-everything core goals in our design. \n\nAbout Olivier Brun\nOlivier Brun has spent the last 2 years working at Orange on the Cloud infrastructures by leading the technical working streams of the global OLAF platform : a cloud native transformation plan of Orange at scale. His 12 years spent at Orange provided him varied experience from Java development, VoIP validation & tests, DNS skill center and support, before embracing the Cloud. While not dealing with IT, Olivier is also a complete sport addict (skiing, fitness, basketball, cycling) and prefers above all a good ride or challenge with his two daughters. \n\nAbout Alexandre Vasseur\nAlexandre Vasseur is in charge of Pivotal ‘ technical field engagements in Europe. He and his team are in charge of technical awareness and solution architecture for customers, prospects and partners in that region around Cloud Foundry and Pivotal solutions.
