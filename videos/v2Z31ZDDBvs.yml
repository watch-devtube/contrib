New tools in infrastructure automation make the process of creating testable and verifiable infrastructure components much easier than in the past. This talk will explore how three of these tools, Chef, Test Kitchen, and Docker, create a workflow for creating and testing application infrastructure before deployment.\n \nTalk objectives:\nThis talk will focus on building infrastructure code developers can trust to deploy applications into various environments ensuring that applications will run as expected.\nTarget audience:\nMid-level application developers and operations engineers. No prior experience with the tools included is assumed."
