description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - Payment is oddly cultural. 25 years after the creation of the Internet, every country has its own preferred online payments method : Credit Cards in France, Ideal in the Netherlands, Sofort in Germany, Alipay or WeChat Pay in China. For developers, navigating international payments has always been a nightmare : different technical standards and heterogenous flows, offline administrative work, poor documentation... In this talk Stan will describe Stripe''s efforts to build /v1/sources - a universal payments API - that allows Stripe to add new payments methods at scale and help businesses better.'
