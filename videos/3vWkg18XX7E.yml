description: "Low Resolution- Event\n\nStrata Rx - O'Reilly Webcast\n\nDiscovering Genetic Associations on Large Data \n\nOne of the key components of personalized medicine is the discovery of relationships between the genome and medically relevant traits, such as the propensity for a given disease or how well a particular drug will work. Early on, it was believed that small numbers of genetic markers would have a strong effect on a trait. Now, however, it appears that many traits are influenced ever so slightly by a large number of genetic markers. To uncover these subtle relationships, large amounts of data are needed. With large amounts of data comes confounding, for example, due to data coming from closely related individuals or individuals across multiple ethnicities. Such confounding leads to seemingly real yet false results. Until recently, models that could correct for such confounding were too computationally demanding to be used on large data. In my talk, I will describe how these models can be made fast without sacrificing accuracy, allowing application to data covering hundreds of thousands of individuals.\n\nAbout David Heckerman\n\nDavid Heckerman is Senior Director of the eScience Group at Microsoft Research. Since 1992, he has been a researcher at Microsoft, where he has created applications including the first content-based spam filter and web services for medical diagnosis. His research is in the areas of statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence with applications in medical diagnosis, the design of a vaccine for HIV, and the search for genetic causes of disease. He received his Ph.D.(1990) and M.D.(1992) from Stanford University. His Ph.D. dissertation on automated medical diagnosis received the ACM doctoral dissertation award.
