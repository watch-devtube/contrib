description: "Pair Programming from 2,000 km Away: Strategies for Distributed Agile Teams - Jen Spinney, HPE\n\nCloud Foundry development is driven by several tenants, agile development, test-driven development and of course pair programming. Pair programming is seen as working best when the pairs are right next to each other working on the same computer in the same room, but what do you do when your pair is hundreds and perhaps thousands of miles away? The Diego team has several members who are not located in San Francisco, so remote pairing is part of our daily workflow. This talk will touch on the tools we use, the process we follow, and how we get the most out of a remote pairing situation. Andrew and Jennifer will also look at the drawbacks most often faced with remote teams and discuss a few strategies the we use to combat issues and to keep the remote team members engaged and productive and have a truly distributed agile development team.\n\nAbout Jen Spinney\nJen Spinney is a software engineer at HP Enterprise, where she works as a core contributor on the CF Diego team. Prior to HPE, she worked at Microsoft on the OData team where she developed a passion for open source and cross-company software development. She pairs remotely from the HPE office in Seattle, WA."
