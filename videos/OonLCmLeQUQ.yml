description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\n\nEffective Trading is about having up-to-date detailed information. Data is acquired from a variety of sources and combined to imply new information. F# is becoming a popular choice for this kind of application. Based on hands on experience of building a Commodity Trading platform I will describe and demonstrate areas where F# gives you leverage like domain modelling, computation and concurrency.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- Clearly demonstrate areas where functional-first programming, specifically with F#, excel within the domain of finance and trading."
