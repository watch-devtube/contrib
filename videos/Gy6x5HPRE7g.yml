description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/berlin2015/heinz-gies\n\nThe kind of talk your parents warned you about, we'll be lying, we'll be cheating, we'll take all the immoral shortcuts we can find and get high on numbers (and probably get very close to slaughtering some cute kittens). At the end we'll see how fast an Erlang metrics database can be and what sins were committed in the process.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- Have fun, talk about performance, how architecture wins every day, look at some really bad erlang code.\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- Everyone who likes metrics, odd code, interesting tricks and performance.\n\n\nAbout Heinz\n\nHeinz started his career in the Telco industry. Ending up as a Senior Engineer for Nokia Siemens Networks before venturing on it’s own. With a love for interesting technologies like Solaris or Erlang he started to make a living out of that passion. Now he works as a freelancer building and supporting the Project-FiFo cloud orchestration suite."
