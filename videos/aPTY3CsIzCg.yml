description: "4 Principles of Release Engineering with BOSH - Maria Ntalla & Jatin Naik, Pivotal\n\nCloud operators want to be able to run and deploy systems repeatedly, reliably, consistently and on a variety of cloud providers. BOSH is a unique tool, that can manage the release engineering, deployment and lifecycle of complex distributed systems like CloudFoundry, kubernetes and Concourse.\n\nIn this talk Maria and Jatin will cover the principles that BOSH was built on, that allow operators to orchestrate and converge cloud deployments. We will also go through the basic mechanics of BOSH like releases and deployments and compare and contrast it to other release engineering and deployment orchestration tools. We would highlight how using BOSH allows release authors to ship software consistently and enables continuous integration and delivery. \n\nAbout Jatin Naik\nJatin is a software engineer for Pivotal Cloud Foundry, currently working on BOSH Backup & Restore. He has previously spoken at Cloud Foundry Summit Silicon Valley 2017, Cloud Foundry Summit Europe 2016 and is a regular at the London PaaS User Group.\n\nAbout Maria Ntalla\nMaria is a software engineer at Pivotal.She is currently working on the Redis offering for Cloud Foundry. She has previously spoken at Cloud Foundry Summit Europe 2016 and 2017, London PaaS Users Group and Women Who Go sessions."
