title: 'Testing smarter, not harder with AI – a realistic overview of what is possible today—Gerta Sheganaku'
language: English
recordingDate: 1584006922
description: "To meet the quality needs and challenges of a fast-paced future driven by ever shorter release cycles and trends like IoT and robotics, our testing approaches need to match up.\nContinuous Testing is currently bridging the gap between development and operations, but we are fast approaching a time when Continuous Testing will be unable to keep pace with shrinking delivery cycle times, increasing technical complexity, and accelerating rates of change. AI, imitating intelligent human behavior for machine learning and predictive analytics, can help us to overcome these challenges.\nIn this talk, Gerta Sheganaku will highlight application areas in which AI can help across different stages of the software quality lifecycle, from test design, redundancy prevention, and defect detection, up to finding and steering the right controls and providing a resilient test automation.\nWe will discuss the areas in which we are already using basic forms of AI and what is still to come in the field of software quality assurance. We need to continue the testing evolution in order to achieve the efficiency needed for testing of robotics, IoT, and similar trends. We will give a realistic perspective of what can and cannot be achieved in the near future and will discuss how we can make use of advanced algorithms like automated test portfolio optimization, self-adjusting risk assessment, automated defect diagnosis, or smart environment provisioning, which may still lack the self-learning component to be classified as AI, but can help bridge the gap between the current state of continuous testing and a future state of AI-based testing.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
