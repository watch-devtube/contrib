description: "Shawn Bower - Software Engineer, Cornell University\nBrett Haranin - Software Engineer, Cornell University\n\nDocker use at Cornell University has been increasing steadily over the last 3 years in our central departments and various colleges - particularly as we move more workloads to the cloud. In this talk, we’ll give an overview of our Docker use cases across campus, featuring in detail two specific projects that highlight the versatility of this technology: Containerizing our central financial system (a traditional monolithic system); and building new researcher-focused financial tools natively in Docker (a microservice architecture built with the cloud in mind). We’ll discuss the design and implementation of both projects in detail. We’ll also describe how Docker has enabled us to develop consistent DevOps and CI practices spanning these two very different architectures."
