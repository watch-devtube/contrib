description: "Can we use convolutional neural networks for time series analysis? It seems like a strange use case of convolutional networks, since they are generally used for image related tasks. But in recent months, more and more papers have started using convolutional networks for sequence classification. And since stock prices are a sequence, we can use them to make predictions. In this video, i'll use the popular tensorflow.js library to test out a prediction model for Apple stock. I'll also talk about how recurrent networks work as background. This is my first proper live stream in a year. Get hype! \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Financial_Forecasting_with_TensorflowJS\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
