title: 'GraphQL State Management for React Native'
language: English
recordingDate: 1536432186
description: "Our apps are data driven, and we end up duplicating data management logic across clients. GraphQL gets rid of duplication. Can layer an Apollo client instead of doing action creators. Clients can request exactly what they need. You get so much for free: normalisation, caching, loading state, error state as well as reactively updating UI. Apollo Client intelligently normalises and caches for you. Redux results in using normalisr + writing your own caching.\n\nEVENT:\n\nChain React 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPeggy Rayzis\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.
