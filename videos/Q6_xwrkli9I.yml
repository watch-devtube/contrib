description: "Google Tech Talks\nMay 23, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAs commodity hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful it becomes tempting to reflexively use relational databases to track and report on large datasets. Rentrak argues the case that a pure-RDBMS solution can be counterproductive, especially for complex analysis of those datasets. I'll describe an alternate approach we currently use to track and report on video-on-demand and linear television viewership.  Credits: Speaker:Aaron Harsh"
