Following are the topics discussed:\nWhat is Predictive Analysis?\nPredictive Analysis Techniques\nChoosing a Predictive Analysis Technique\nPredictive Analysis Models\n\nPython Tutorial Playlist: https://goo.gl/WsBpKe\nMachine Learning Tutorial Playlist: https://goo.gl/UxjTxm\nBlog Series: http://bit.ly/2sqmP4s\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n🔴Do subscribe to our channel and hit the bell icon to never miss an update from us in the future: https://goo.gl/6ohpTV \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/edureka_learning/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka \nTelegram: https://t.me/edurekaupdates \nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/EdurekaIN \nMeetup: https://www.meetup.com/edureka/    \n\n#PythonEdureka #Edureka #predictiveanalysis #machinelearning #pythonprojects #pythonprogramming #pythontutorial #PythonTraining #machinelearningTutorial\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow it Works? \n\nEdureka’s Machine Learning Course using Python is designed to make you grab the concepts of Machine Learning. Machine Learning training will provide a deep understanding of Machine Learning and its mechanism. As a Data Scientist, you will be learning the importance of Machine Learning and its implementation in the python programming language. Furthermore, you will be taught of Reinforcement Learning which in turn is an important aspect of Artificial Intelligence. You will be able to automate real-life scenarios using Machine Learning Algorithms. Towards the end of the course, we will be discussing various practical use cases of Machine Learning in the python programming language to enhance your learning experience. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhy Learn Machine Learning using Python?\n\nData Science is a set of techniques that enables computers to learn the desired behavior from data without explicitly being programmed. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science. This course exposes you to different classes of machine learning algorithms like supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement algorithms. This course imparts you the necessary skills like data pre-processing, dimensional reduction, model evaluation and also exposes you to different machine learning algorithms like regression, clustering, decision trees, random forest, Naive Bayes and Q-Learning. \n\nAfter completing this Machine Learning Certification Training using Python, you should be able to:\nGain insight into the 'Roles' played by a Machine Learning Engineer\nAutomate data analysis using python\nDescribe Machine Learning\nWork with real-time data\nLearn tools and techniques for predictive modeling\nDiscuss Machine Learning algorithms and their implementation\nValidate Machine Learning algorithms\nExplain Time Series and it’s related concepts\nGain expertise to handle business in the future, living the present\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWho should go for this Machine Learning Certification Training using Python?\n\nEdureka’s Python Machine Learning Certification Course is a good fit for the below professionals:\nDevelopers aspiring to be a ‘Machine Learning Engineer'\nAnalytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts\nBusiness Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques\nInformation Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics\n'Python' professionals who want to design automatic predictive models\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.in or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free)"
