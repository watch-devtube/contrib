description: "Google Tech Talks\nMay, 14 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\n \nThe initial reaction and subsequent adoption patterns innovative designs receive often surprise their designers. But, regardless of the care and passion any designer embeds in a novel creation, the ultimate success metric can rest on the design's intended functional effectiveness and subsequent adoption rate on the design's ultimate proving ground.\n\nWith warship design, well-intentioned, but ultimately misguided, design goals and applications can result in a harsh, swift, and unforgiving annihilation of the fledgling technology embodiment, its immediate attendants, as well as it's delivery platform. It is also true that failing to adopt a timely design innovation can have the same consequence. In either case, outcomes can prove catastrophic to participants. Here, reality, not opinion provides an acid test.\n\nThis presentation focuses on warship evolution and a few of its several lessons for designers in nearly all vocations. From wooden warships to today's floating steel leviathans, Warship Evolution examines design innovators, their decisions, and exogenous events that shaped today's modern warships. As the anchor rises from the seabed and lights dim, prepare to lash yourself to a sturdy mast before traversing warship design history, safely out of harms way.\n\nSpeaker: David Schwaderer\nW. David Schwaderer is a veteran Silicon Valley executive and entrepreneur. He is presently acting as the Symantec Technology Network Editor-In-Chief where he oversees corporate data protection technology and system security technical publishing as well as a monthly newsletter distributed to 120,000 global readers.\n\nDavid has a Masters Degree in Applied Mathematics from the California Institute of Technology and an MBA from the University of Southern California. Whenever possible, he lectures at universities such as Stanford and MIT and immerses Silicon Valley companies in his favorite subject - innovation.\n\nDavid has authored ten technical books and six commercial software programs for a variety of computing architectures using several different languages. His soon-to-be-published eleventh book follows ten years of research and is titled Innovation Survival - Concept, Courage and Change."
