description: "Speaker: Joshua Kerievsky (@JoshuaKerievsky), CEO, Industrial Logic Inc.\n\nOver the past decade, innovative companies, software industry thought leaders and lean/agile pioneers have discovered simpler, sturdier, and more streamlined ways to be agile.  These modern approaches share a focus on producing exceptional outcomes and growing an outstanding culture.  Today, it makes far more sense to bypass antiquated agility in favor of modern approaches.\n\nModern agile methods are defined by four guiding principles:\n\nMake people awesome\nMake safety a prerequisite\nExperiment & learn rapidly\nDeliver value continuously\nWorld famous organizations like Google, Amazon, AirBnB, Etsy and others are living proof of the power of these four principles.  However, you don’t need to be a name brand company to leverage modern agile wisdom.\n\nIn this talk I’ll explain what I mean by modern agility, share real-world modern agile stories, show how modern agile addresses key risks while targeting results over rituals, and reveal how the 2001 agile manifesto can be updated to reflect modern agile’s four guiding principles.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nJoshua is a globally recognized thought leader in Agile and Lean software development. He is an entrepreneur, author and programmer passionate about excellent software and discovering better, faster and safer ways to produce it.
