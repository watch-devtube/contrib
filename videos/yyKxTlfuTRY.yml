Most of the enterprise applications are monolithic and re-architecting applications requires a tremendous effort. Also teams don't have an upfront visibility of integration aspects like routing, inter-service and database level dependencies. This adds a huge risk towards the end of the modernization effort. An alternate approach is to optimize the build process and deploy the applications in a distributed mode on Kubernetes. This approach is useful in many ways as the teams can mitigate integration issues early in the transformation cycle and can slowly improve the application architecture to reap the full benefits of kubernetes. This presentation will cover the approach to isolate services at build and deployment level before converting them as independent microservices. \n\nhttps://sched.co/YVxi"
