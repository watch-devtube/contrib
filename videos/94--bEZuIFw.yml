description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nThe value of experimentation (also known as A/B testing) is well known, and yet the implementation and scaling of experimentation from niche to pervasive is frequently a major obstacle and an area that businesses of all sizes struggle in. Colin McFarland, Head of Experimentation at Skyscanner, developed the global travel search business from being a small-scale experimentation to a state where the practice is ingrained, with hundreds of experiments undertaken each month. This talk will provide practical insights on how to augment experimentation within a business, expanding on the case for causality, common pitfalls to avoid, and how tooling and education can drive the data-focussed culture that is so essential in delivering a competitive edge.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers.org/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/wearedevs/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearedevelopers.org/"
