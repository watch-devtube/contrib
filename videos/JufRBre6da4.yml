Python cuts development time in half with its simple to read syntax and easy compilation feature. Debugging your programs is a breeze in Python with its built in debugger. Using Python makes Programmers more productive and their programs ultimately better. Python continues to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations.\nPython runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS and has been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. Python is free to use, even for the commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license. \nPython has evolved as the most preferred Language for Data Analytics and the increasing search trends on python also indicates that Python is the next \"Big Thing\" and a must for Professionals in the Data Analytics domain. \n\nWho should go for python?\n\nEdureka’s Data Science certification course in Python is a good fit for the below professionals:\n\n·         Programmers, Developers, Technical Leads, Architects\n\n·         Developers aspiring to be a ‘Machine Learning Engineer'\n\n·         Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts\n\n·         Business Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques\n\n·         Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics\n\n·         'Python' professionals who want to design automatic predictive models\n\nFor more information, Please write back to us at sales@edureka.in or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll free)"
