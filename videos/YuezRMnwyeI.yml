description: "A few months ago I was invited to give a workshop at Women’s International Leadership Conference on Introduction to Programming. That was an amazing experience that taught me incredible things and motivated me to open source all the steps. Some of the topics I’ll cover on this talk are:\n\n- Why Javascript is an appropriate introductory language to programming, versus popular teaching choices such as Python\n\n- What is feasible in a short length workshop\n\n- How programming workshops empower and inspire learners\n\n- How this experience contributed to my own learning, as well as personal and professional growth\n\n- The materials to reproduce this workshop\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte"
