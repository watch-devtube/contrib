description: "Intro to Agones: Scaling Multiplayer Game Servers with Kubernetes - Mark Mandel, Google \n\nKubernetes provides an amazing toolset for running processes over potentially thousands of machines. However, Dedicated Game Servers for real time multiplayer games, such as Fortnight, Overwatch, etc, have their own challenges that don’t directly line up with the solutions that Kubernetes natively provide. Game Servers are neither stateless (no Deployments), or ordered stateful (no StatefulSets) - but sit somewhere in between the two. They require direct connections (no load balancers), and can’t be turned off once players are connected to them (no traditional autoscalers).  In this talk we’ll discuss and demo the open source project Agones, developed by Google Cloud Platform in conjunction with Ubisoft. Utilising Kubernetes native extension mechanisms, it attempts to solve this problem by providing a batteries-included solution for running Dedicated Game Servers at scale on Kubernetes. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrU3"
