description: "The web deserves to be the third mobile runtime, but it isn't. What is holding it back? It faces challenges from industry, the standards process, browser implementations, and probably our own short-sightedness.\n\nThe web's unnerving ability to disrupt shouldn't be taken for granted. It wants to evolve, but we must encourage that process in order for it to become competitive again.\n\nOn a journey from device APIs to standards groups, from test suites to provocative demos, let's figure out how to move the web forward towards a brave mobile future.\n\nAbout James: https://twitter.com/jamespearce\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
