description: "\"With microservices every outage is like a murder mystery\"\n\nThis is a common complaint. But it doesn't have to be! This talk gives an overview on how to monitor Spring Boot applications, since they are increasingly popular for building microservices. We dive into:\n\nSystem metrics: Keep track of network traffic and system load.\nApplication logs: Collect structured logs in a central location.\nUptime monitoring: Ping services and actively monitor their availability and response time.\nApplication metrics: Get the information from Boot's metrics and health via REST or JMX.\nRequest tracing: Use elastic APM to trace requests through a distributed system to show how long each call takes from Kibana.\nAnd we will do all of that live, since it is so easy and much more interactive that way.\n\nVoxxed Days Microservices 2018: 2 days conference (+1 optional workshops day) only on Microservices. \n\nFollow us on :\nWebsite : https://voxxeddays.com/microservices (bit.ly/vxdmicro)\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vxdmicroservice\nLinkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/voxxed-days-microservices-906115164\nKeep in touch : https://t.co/pxf7cHZOpl\n\n#developers #conference #microservices"
