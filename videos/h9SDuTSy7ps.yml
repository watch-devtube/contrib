title: 'Flux: A modern way of doing MVC? by Leitner David and Thomas Eizinger'
language: English
recordingDate: 1522160284
description: "Coming from the enterprise world, with frameworks like JSF, Spring MVC, Asp.net MVC or the like, working for the first time with React and Redux was really stunning for us. It felt like a completely new and better way of building UIs and lots of people we talked to experienced something similar. However, the more you become familiar with these libraries and upon taking a closer look, you realize that what they do is not that new actually.\nWe will go back to the origins and goals of the legendary MVC pattern which was first introduced in Smalltalk-76. Given this knowledge, the differences to alternatives like MVP or MVVM are pointed out, and similarities to more recent approaches like FLUX become quite obvious. By exploring the main ideas behind these concepts, the consequences of uni-directional and bi-directional dataflows or the relation between transient state, pure transformations and a single source of truth become reasonable.\nUpon a closer look, it becomes clear that these concepts for managing UI state are not limited to a specific kind of technology or framework. Rather, they are suited for different kinds of problems. In a nutshell, state management in complex applications can be a tedious task, but this talk will increase your ability to use the right tool for the job."
