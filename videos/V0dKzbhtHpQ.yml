description: "We always hear about the word \"community\" all the time, from companies, meetups, and sometimes groups of like-minded people. It has quite a broad meaning yet pretty vague at the same time. I‘ll walk you through my personal experience in defining the true meaning behind all of this.\n\nChee Aun is a Front-End Engineer from Malaysia, and currently based in Singapore.\nHe enjoys working on many side projects, like HackerWeb, Life and BusRouter SG.\nHe also organises KopiJS, a casual social gathering for engineers, designers and makers in Singapore.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 25+26 November 2016.\n\nSource: https://2016.jsconf.asia/\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/cheeaun/bridging-connections\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
