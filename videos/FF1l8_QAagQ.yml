description: "Long ago when computers were introduced we were promised a world in which most of our most mundane tasks would be taken over by a computer. However, if you go into most organizations you will still see many business processes being done by people. Meanwhile the computer sits idly by on a desk showing weather updates.\n\nWith SharePoint 2010 you are able to use not only the browser based out of the box Workflows but you can also use SharePoint Designer 2010 in order to edit those out of the box ones along with creating your own custom workflows. And as an added benefit Visio 2010 can also be used to prepare workflow templates to further create custom workflows.\n\nThis session will use actual business cases to show you how SharePoint has been utilized to automate business processes using workflows. I will show you how the out of the box workflows are powerful and can handle some of the more common of business processes. We will then progress to how the out of the box workflows can be modified using SharePoint Designer 2010.\n\nCreating workflows will also be covered; this session will go into how SharePoint Designer 2010 can be used to quickly put together custom workflows in order to provide routine solutions for automating some of the more intermediate level business processes. The out of the box and SharePoint Designer 2010 workflows are great if you have an already established and documented business process. On the other hand, what do you do when the business process is not clearly defined or documented? This session will wrap up with how Visio 2010 can be used to flowchart a business process and then we will take this flowchart and use SharePoint Designer 2010 to create a workflow."
