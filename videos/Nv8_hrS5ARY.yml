title: 'How I built a programming language - Carl Mäsak'
recordingDate: 1540551932
description: "Writing a compiler is generally thought of as Really Hard, basically rocket surgery. To my surprise I found it quite straightforward, almost pleasant. I sincerely believe most people should do it. Consider this evening a crash course in how to get started writing your own compiler. Compilers are simple \"data pipes\", and there are definitely deep aspects to making them, but the basic principles are straightforward.\n\nThe thing that's difficult, though, is deciding all the little things about your language. Curly braces or indentation? Will you have a new keyword? What about types, and operators, and methods? Frustratingly, all those little decisions end up forming a whole united experience, and a tiny choice in one end can have disastrous Butterfy-Effect consequences in another end. Being a language designer is its own special hell, and not something I wish on everyone.\n\nStop by for a hands-on introduction to things that we use every day and all benefit from understanding better: compilers, languages, and frustrating language features.\n\nOh, and the language is called \"007\". cue James Bond theme\n\nCarl Mäsak has decades of experience building, reviewing, and teaching software. He has authored, reviewed, and improved the insides of systems used for content management, bioinformatics, retail, publishing, and embedded devices. His work is driven by the belief that no matter what domain a program is written for, it can benefit from clearly expressing the author’s intent. He spends his spare time in the Perl 6 community, working mostly on the compiler stack.\n_________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
