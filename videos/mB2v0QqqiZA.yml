title: 'qt webkit goes Mobile'
recordingDate: 1297781106
description: "by Kenneth Christiansen\r\n\r\nWebKit is everywhere, on desktops, mobiles, - and as an integrated part of the Qt platform, it is on Linux-based MeeGo as well.\r\n\r\nn this session we will quickly introduce the WebKit project, and look at why it has become so popular on the mobile platform. We will look at some of the mobile adaptions normally done by the different WebKit ports and at the work we have been doing in Qt WebKit to make it more fit for mobile usage.\r\n\r\nSome of the technologies we will touch, includes: frame flattening, tiling (including challenges), viewport meta information, touch events and fuzzy hit testing.\r\n\r\nWe hope the session will make people aware of the importance of the Qt WebKit project and its mobile efforts; create discussions and use-cases that we can use for integrating even better with, in particular, open source projects targeting mobile usage and the open source community in general.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
