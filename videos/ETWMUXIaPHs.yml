description: 'If Messaging and Video communications are now in our habits (whether WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Cisco Spark…), it is still pretty complicated to integrate these capabilities in our Mobile and Web applications.   Announced at both Apple and Cisco WW conferences in July 2016 (https://developer.cisco.com/site/apple/), Cisco is working on a SDK that allows developers to add video capabilities to any apps with just a few lines of code.   Join this session to get latest information about these SDKs and the underlying Tropo and Spark architectures.'
