title: 'Luca Maraschi - Deploying node.js at scale'
language: English
recordingDate: 1472140971
description: 'Enterprises are used to traditional monolithic architectures and the migration to a more scalable microservices based architecture does not come without challenges. From designing to deploying the app at scale, requires a rethink of the internal processes and practices, of the way the team is coding and operations are then running the solution in production. Microservices can then be taken to their extreme when SWIM communication and scalability enter the field, pushing the solution to its extreme. Think, build and run are going to be the topics of this talk.'
