description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss how to address some of the most likely causes of failure for new Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. My main recommendation is to take an iterative approach: don't assume you know what your pipeline should look like, let alone your annotation schemes or model architectures.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
