description: "Transformational Leadership: What Every DevOps Leader Needs To Know\n\nSteve Mayner, SAFe Senior Program Consultant, Scaled Agile, Inc.\n\nAdopting DevOps principles and practices frequently leads enterprises down a path to significant cultural and organizational change. This creates a real barrier for DevOps advocates to overcome, since leading researchers sparked by John Kotter’s claim of a 70% failure rate for organizational change have confirmed through scientific study that these types of transformative efforts are more likely to fail than to succeed. Fortunately, all is not lost! The scientific community has also uncovered a powerful tool that consistently increases the success rate of transformational change. The secret weapon is leadership… but not just any style of leadership…\n\nIn this session, Steve Mayner will share the research he has uncovered in his own doctoral journey on the power of transformational leadership to drive successful organizational change. How enterprise leaders cast vision, encourage individual growth, demonstrate authenticity, and challenge followers to maximize their creative potential can have a greater influence on the success\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
