description: "## WTF is a graph database\n- Euler and Graph Theory\n- Math -- it's hard, let's skip it\n- It's about data -- lots of it\n- But let's zoom in and look at the basics\n## Relational model vs graph model\n- How do we represent THINGS in DBs\n- Relational vs Graph\n- Nodes and Relationships\n## Why use a graph over a relational DB or other NoSQL?\n- Very simple compared to RDBMS, and much more flexible\n- The real power is in relationship-focused data (most NoSQL dbs don't treat relationships as first-order)\n- As related-ness and amount of data increases, so does advantage of Graph DBs\n- Much closer to our whiteboard model\n\nEVENT: Nodevember 2016\n\nSPEAKER: Ed Finkler\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on Nodevember YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vleFxDGoEs"
