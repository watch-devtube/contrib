description: "It is still common to blame insufficient requirement gathering or the lack of design at the early stage of a software project for all the unexpected changes you have to do down the road. While many are putting lots of energy into predicting the future and are consistently failing in doing it, agile teams don't waste time and simply get the job done.\r\nDo you feel your head explode each time you need to come up with the final design for a new big feature set? Have you experienced the moments of despair when you watch your design, once looking brilliant on paper, now falling apart after you've just started to implement it? Well, that happens when you try to make pigs fly. You'd better embrace Emergent Design."
