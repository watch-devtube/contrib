description: 'Keeping the culture of a startup alive can be challenging once it''s incorporated into a large company. Maintaining the speed, agility, integrity and risk-taking of an independent venture is crucial, while also recognizing that a newer product/company can come to life with the resources that a large company can offer. Brad Garlinghouse, Tony Conrad and Jason Shellen talk about bringing start-up culture to the benefit of both parties. The AOL executive group will discuss Brad''s vision of infusing AOL culture with the vibrancy of startup life and Tony and Jason''s experiences incorporating their companies into to AOL.'
