description: "Slides and more info: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2016/jose-valim\n\nWeb developers have typically been presented with a choice between performance or a productive development environment. With Phoenix, developers can have both while enjoying a wonderful set of abstractions for working with the new web, making streaming data to browsers, native mobile application or embedded clients a breeze.
