description: "The \"if else\" logic is not entirely intuitive for our minds. We'll explore some alternatives that would lead to the same results but without using the more traditional logic sintax most of us are used to. We'll also see how we can benefit from reducing the complexity of our code in favour of readability, making it say what we really mean instead of having to translate all of our thoughts into a series of \"if else\" statements.\n\nhttps://www.jsconfar.com/"
