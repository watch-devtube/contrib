description: "Microservices and containers networking: Contiv, deep dive and demo\n\nContiv provides a higher level of networking abstraction for microservices: it provides built-in service discovery and service routing for scale out services, working with schedulers like Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesos and Openshift. A powerful policy-based management that makes networking on large scale easy. We will see some code examples, use cases and an easy tutorial on the web. This session is a follow up to the successful sessions at Codemotion Rome and Amsterdam in 2016: we'll go deeper into the architecture and the use cases."
