description: "DevDay (http://devday.pl),\n20th of September 2013, Kraków\n\nHadi Hariri - \"Moving the Web to the client\"\n\nDescription:\n\"Traditional web development frameworks are changing. With an increase in popular frameworks for client-side web development such as Backbone, Ember or AngularJS, the role of the backed is limited to data processing and serving information. And that's exactly where it should be. In this session we're going to combine the power of concise JVM languages such as Kotlin, with front-end frameworks to create powerful and rich web applications. We'll see how we can drastically reduce the amount of code required and crete a maintainable system.\""
