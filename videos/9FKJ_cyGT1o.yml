description: "Keynote: Allstate/CompoZed Labs - One Year Later - Doug Safford, Vice President in the Allstate Technology & Strategic Ventures Group, Allstate Insurance\n\nAt the 2015 Cloud Foundry Summit, Allstate spoke about their goal of being thought of as more of a software company. Transforming an 85-year-old Fortune 100 company involves creating a shift in how to conduct business, but also in how technology can facilitate and even increase this process. The threats and issues facing Allstate’s business-technology transformation are typical of many large companies. \n\nDoug will discuss how Allstate’s technology strategy has shifted since 2015 as the insurance giant moves aggressively to the cloud. Doug will also cover how far Allstate has come in the last year, what's been working, the challenges that remain, and the journey which continues full speed ahead.\n\nDoug Safford \nAllstate\nDoug Safford is a vice president in the Allstate Technology & Strategic Ventures group of Allstate Insurance Company.
