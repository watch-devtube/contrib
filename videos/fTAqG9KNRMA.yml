recordingDate: 1554219028
description: "Is site reliability engineering and serverless a match made in heaven or is something missing and it’s a disaster waiting to happen? In this talk we will discuss just what is required for building reliable Serverless systems and introduce a new concept called FinDevOps and learn about using cost as an operational metric. We will also explore each of the SRE principals such as embracing risk, service level objectives, monitoring and others and map them to their serverless counterparts to identify challenges and best practices. Finally we will make a few predictions about our serverless future and what it means for Serverless software engineering and operations as a whole.\n\nWebsite: https://boston.serverlessdays.io"
