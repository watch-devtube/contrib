title: 'Is Your Gatekeeper Locking Out Quality? - Songkick'
recordingDate: 1470072508
description: "Is Your Gatekeeper Locking Out Quality?\n\nAmy Phillips, Head of Test, Songkick\n\nReleasing software is scary. As a tester the fear of breaking things comes with the added pressure that you were responsible for the testing. Testers and people working with testers often expect that testing alone is the determiner of quality releases. When the product doesn’t meet expectations more safely checks get added to the testing and release process. Over time testers can easily become gatekeepers as they try to protect users from poor quality products.\n\nUnfortunately quality is about far more than just testing.\n\nIn this experience report, Amy Phillips, with your help, will explore what quality is and look at the ways that Continuous Delivery can help deliver it. A look back over the last 6 years of Songkick development processes will show how removing gatekeepers allowed Songkick to unlock their release cycle and start shipping quality features multiple times a day.\n\nDOES16 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
