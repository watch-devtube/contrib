description: "DevOps Champions: Leading the Transformation at Quicken Loans\n\nTyler Underwood, Sr. Application Engineer, Quicken Loans\n\nA champion in the workforce is a person and/or team that drives positive transformation and understands best-practice principles to implement. DevOps is a journey, and – more than any shiny new technology – at its core, it’s all about the people. \n\nDevOps requires a cultural/mindset shift: it’s a new way of thinking, empowering, and collaborating that requires champions in the organization to drive this transformation.\n\nThis talk covers:\n\n• How do you move from “Heroes” to “Champions” to scale your DevOps adoption in the organization?\n• How to use “The Three Ways: The Principle Underpinning DevOps” to accelerate your DevOps rollout?\n• Potential challenges encountered along the way. What did we learn?\n• What are some tactics for ensuring buy-in and encourage participation both at the executive level and at the team-level?\n• How do you work with legacy applications, (and sometimes - “legacy” people) on your road to DevOps?\n• Tips for how champions “grease the wheels” for moving DevOps transformations forward.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
