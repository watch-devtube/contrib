description: 'Reactive Extensions (Rx) has brought reactive programming to the mainstream in recent years with successful adoption in languages such as C#, Java and JavaScript. But have you ever wondered what Rx will look like as a language? Elm is a new programming language based on the idea of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP). Elm lets you create highly interactive web applications without all the messy callbacks tangling around shared states. In this talk Yan Cui will give a gentle introduction to Elm and FRP and finish off with a live demo building a web-based game from scratch.'
