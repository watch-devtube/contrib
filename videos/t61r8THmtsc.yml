description: "Multi-DC Cloud Foundry: What, Why and How? - Daniel Jones, EngineerBetter & Colin Humphreys, Pivotal\n\nWhat are the fundamental choices that need to be made when running Cloud Foundry in more than one data centre, and what tools can help operators deal with the compromises that CAP theorem enforces? In this talk Colin Humphreys details the deployment models of Cloud Foundry, and explains that whilst it’s possible to keep apps running and available in a multi-data centre deployment, operators face a compromise of increased operational overhead if they want to be able to continue changing the state of their PaaS in the event of an outage. Daniel Jones then shows some of the open source tooling that helps manage the operational complexity required by those wishing to operate a highly-available multi-data centre Cloud Foundry installation.\n\nAbout Colin Humphreys\nAs CTO for Cloud at Pivotal, Colin Humphreys is responsible for the company’s big picture strategy and roadmap for our cloud platform offerings. Colin joins Pivotal from its acquisition of CloudCredo, where Colin was co-founder and CEO. Colin led the installation of the first SLA-driven production Cloud Foundry deployment, delivers tooling to the Cloud Foundry community, and is a regular conference speaker on PaaS-related topics. He also organises the London PaaS User Group, and is passionate about “Infrastructure as Code”, “Continuous Delivery”, “Devops”, and “Agile Testing”. Colin has spent the last 15 years sitting on the fence between development and operations, delivering solutions for eBay, Volkswagen, Paypal, Cineworld, and others.\n\nAbout Daniel Jones\nDaniel Jones is CTO of UK Cloud Foundry consultancy EngineerBetter. He has recently been operating and supporting multiple production CF instances at a global wealth management enterprise, and helping an IoT tech startup build their platform atop CF. Daniel was a member of the Pivotal CF London Services team, and also worked with Europe's leading CF consultancy CloudCredo. Daniel has spoken at CF Summit Santa Clara 2016, CF Summit Berlin 2015 and the London PaaS User Group, as well as numerous video games industry conferences. He once even stormed the stage at a music festival to interrupt the performing act and challenge their questionable off-stage conduct!"
