description: "How do I get the job I want?\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - PyCharm [PyData]]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Franziska Schropp\n\nEngineers are rare, jobs are plenty, so far so good. But what if I don’t just want any job that pays the bills, but the job that will push my career and that I actually enjoy doing every day? If your answer to why you’d like to join company XY is: “Work from home and make good money”, you should not be surprised to not be taken into the next round. But what would be a good answer to that question? What should I say when asked where I see myself in 5 years? There are a lot of subtle aspects to succeeding and failing in the application process, from your initial cover letter to the on site visit meeting the team.  As a tech recruiter, I’d like to share with you the best and (sometimes quite entertaining) worst practices in the application process in order to help you get the job you want!\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
