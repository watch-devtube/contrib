title: '"Tulip: A Language for Humans" by Sig Cox, Jeanine Adkisson'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474222484
description: 'There are a lot of competing ideas about what makes a language “good”. This is because we as language designers still have no idea what we''re doing. The design of Tulip is based on careful study of a wide variety of popular and esoteric programming languages over about 4 years. Its runtime takes cues from Erlang, and its syntax is slightly like ML, but with a few key innovations designed for repl ergonomics. Tulip is one of the new languages to come out of the language community Snek, emphasizing languages by minority designers and implementers.'
