description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nC++ has been notorious for being a second class citizen when it comes to test frameworks. There are plenty of them but they tend to be fiddly to set-up and ceremonious to use. Many of them attempt to follow the xUnit template without respect for the language environment they are written for. Catch is an attempt to cut through all of that. It is simple to get and simple to use - being distributed in a single header file - yet is powerful and flexible. Catch includes a number of innovations that make testing in C++ more natural - and fun - than ever before. This presentation introduces you to the unique approach that Catch brings to unit and integration testing - and how to use Catch to drive your design with TDD or BDD.\n— \nPhil Nash:  Long time C++ developer but also dabbles with F#, Objective-C, Swift, C#, Python, D, Rust and others. | Open source author and contributor - particularly Catch - a C++ test framework in a single header file. | Interested in all forms of bettering oneself!\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
