description: "As creatives we constantly search for ways to optimise and streamline workflows. Currently we’re being bombarded with more tools than ever. But how do we know that we reached a tipping point, when the apparatus we pick introduces more complexity and wastes way more time that it was supposed to save? As craftspeople, how do we maintain simplicity and learn to rely on bare-bones solutions? We’ll have a look at up-to-date front-end tooling and analyse alternative approaches to compiling, building and automation processes.\n\nKarolina is a designer, developer, photographer and wannabe writer working with her friends at &yet. She’s an editor at Smashing Magazine and Open Source fan. She owns a cat and an excessive amount of books on typography.\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Bridging Design and Implementation. Amara Sanctuary, Singapore - 19 November 2014.\n\nSource: http://2014.cssconf.asia/#speakers\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/fox/no-more-tools\nWhat is &yet video: http://vimeo.com/97239546\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
