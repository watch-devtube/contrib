We web developers are the ones who can fix that and I’ll show you how.\n\nChris has been doing all sorts of things to innocent web sites for 17 years and is also responsible for unleashing web forms library Quaid-JS upon the world. He is currently working in the in-house web team at insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson in Perth, Australia Aside from musical distractions and earning frequent flyer points, Chris and his wife Sarah can often be found in the company of their very small human. \n\nThe node community has change tremendously as it has evolved over the last 5 years. Some of the most modern and progressive practices in open source are being tested to great success in this relatively new and dynamic community. While the core project has struggled to release and attract new contributors perhaps the future of node lies not in its central project but in the community that is continuing to grow and flourish.\n\nMikeal is the Director of Evangelism at DigitalOcean and the creator of request, NodeConf and JSFest.\n\nJSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia.
