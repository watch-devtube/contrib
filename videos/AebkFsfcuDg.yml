recordingDate: 1406063813
description: 'We all love Groovy as a language to develop applications on servers or desktop. But what about mobile applications? In particular, with Android natively supporting Java, is it possible to develop an application in Groovy? Can we ease the pain on that platform too?In this session, we will demonstrate that it is possible to run an application on Android, developped using the Groovy language and the Gradle plugin. We will discuss the modifications that were needed to do this, as well as the limitations and drawbacks.'
