title: 'YOW! West 2016 Michael Feathers - Testing Patience'
recordingDate: 1467601701
description: "Automated testing is widely considered a best practice. After considerable effort, the industry now agrees that unit testing, system testing, usability, and performance testing are essential in most serious development efforts, but we know that they are hard work. In this keynote, Michael Feathers will discuss challenges to the testing orthodoxy presented by micro-services, transient code, and functional programming, and reflect on where we might find ourselves in 10 years.\n\nMichael Feathers is the Founder and Director of R7K Research & Conveyance, a company specializing in software and organization design. Prior to forming R7K, Michael was the Chief Scientist of Obtiva and a consultant with Object Mentor International. Over the past 20 years he has consulted with hundreds of organizations, supporting them with general software design issues, process change and code revitalization. A frequent presenter at national and international conferences, Michael is also the author of the book Working Effectively with Legacy Code (Prentice Hall, 2004).\n\nFor more on YOW!
