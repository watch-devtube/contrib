title: 'Goodbye history tables, hello full audit- exploring message streams & event sourcing- M. Bustamante'
recordingDate: 1499244180
description: "The good news is that if you are already designing for a microservices environment, you are already positioned to do this with less pain. Services that \"fit in your head\" lead to a manageable number of messages or events - allowing you to take a step toward this new message-based system.\n\nIn this session you'll learn how to design a microservices solution that first relies on message streams to produce state, history and full audit - as a baby step toward full-blown event sourcing. In the session you'll see patterns for structuring your solutions, managing message and payload designs, creating a hybrid without event sourcing whereby you have full history and audit, and finally what the step to event sourcing might look like."
