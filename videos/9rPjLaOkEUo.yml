description: "Java Microservices at Scale on Cloud Foundry, Today and Tomorrow [I] - Pieter Humphrey and Madhura Bhave, Pivotal    \n\nWhat makes Cloud Foundry the best place to run Java microservices? Looking beyond the Java buildpack -- we'll examine what makes a distributed platform such a perfect fit for distributed applications. How can BOSH managed microservice infrastructure make life easier for DevOps teams once a service has been deployed? What could operational automation look like for critical functions like service discovery, circuit breaker monitoring, and configuration services? Application and operations-focused developers, Architects, and IT managers will walk away with a solid introduction to what makes Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Spring Cloud Data Flow workloads exciting on Cloud Foundry.\n\nMadhura\nPivotal\nMadhura Bhave is a developer at Pivotal on the Spring Boot team. Before joining the Spring Boot team, Madhura worked on the UAA (Authentication and Authorization component for Cloud Foundry) which is written in Spring.\nPieter Humphrey\nPivotal Software, Inc\nPrincipal Product Marketing Manager\nSan Francisco Bay Area\n\nMy role at Pivotal is focused on app and infra developers that use Java, Spring and Cloud Foundry. Java middleware has been my focus for nearly two decades, working in development, marketing, sales, and developer relations at BEA, Oracle, VMWare and Pivotal.
