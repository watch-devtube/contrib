description: "Speakers: Saurabh Gupta\r\n\r\nGoogle Apps Script is a JavaScript cloud scripting language that provides easy ways to automate tasks across Google products and third party services. Apps Script provides simple to use APIs for integrating various Google and non-Google services (e.g. Calendar, Contacts, Maps, Twitter etc.). Apps Script does not require any compilation and deployment. With a simple browser based editor, you can start writing and \r\nexecuting scripts as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nWith Google Apps Script you can:\r\n- Automate repetitive business processes. (e.g. expense approvals, time-sheet tracking, ticket management, order fulfillment, and much more)\r\n- Link Google products with third party services (e.g. send custom emails and a calendar invitation to a list from a spreadsheet)\r\n- Build UI applications in Google Sites and Google Spreadsheets.\r\n- Enhance spreadsheet functionality by creating custom spreadsheet functions.\r\n- Automate tasks that are time or event driven. (e.g. run a nightly pending sales orders)"
