title: 'From possible to practical: The path for defense - Dan Kaminsky (White Ops)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1480518874
description: 'Defensive technology that is not practical will not be deployed and will defend nothing at all. Dan Kaminsky discusses how a strong focus on ease of use—for developers, operators, and users—is our only hope for migrating to a more secure Internet. Cryptography, authentication, software isolation, even bug discovery and remediation have all remained the realm of gurus. They’re not enough. Dan explains how to defend better.'
