recordingDate: 1546871775
description: "This course gives you a practical introduction to building neural networks in the browser and in Node.js using the Brain.js JavaScript library. To complete the course’s interactive challenges, simply head over to the Scrimba version: https://scrimba.com/g/gneuralnetworks\n\n??What you'll learn ??\nBy the end of the course, you'll be able to solve a range of different problems using neural networks. The lectures does not dwell with much theory, but rather on how to code the networks. That means the course is suitable for anybody who knows JavaScript. \n\n??About Robert Plummer ??\nRobert is the lead developer of the Brain.js library. He has a unique ability to explain complex concepts in a manner that everyone can understand. Feel free to reach out to Robert via Twitter if you have feedback, or simply want to thank him for creating this course.\n\nGood luck, and welcome to the exciting world of neural networks!\n\n??Course Contents ??\n??
