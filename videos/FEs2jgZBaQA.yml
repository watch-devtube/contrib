In this talk, learn about the bleeding edge tools that can automate keeping your CSS on the fast path. Automate generating critical-path CSS, removing unused CSS, discovering duplicate selectors, colors and more.\n\nAlong the way, we might even optimize a well known conference site and send them a pull request to help keep the web fast.
