title: 'DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Amazing User Experiences with Drupal and Ember'
recordingDate: 1462914495
description: "When we combine Drupal 8's strong extensibility with Ember's strong conventions, something magic happens: we get Drupal sites that can be seamlessly extended into the browser, with access to a deep ecosystem of Ember addons that deliver amazing experiences out-of-the-box. All without writing any glue code.\n\nSee Drupal like you haven't seen it before, with gorgeous inter-page animations, Service Worker-driven offline capabilities, and in-site authoring tools with instant preview across multiple device sizes.\n\nA Javascript-curious Drupal developer should be able to come away from this session and add new capabilities to their existing D8 site that will make people say \"Wow!\"\n\nPrerequisites: intermediate experience as a Drupal developer, basic familiarity with Javascript, and a willingness to rethink the boundaries of what Drupal can be.\n\nTopics presented:\n\nWhy Javascript circa 2016 is nothing like Javascript circa 2006, and the opportunites this creates.\nWhat is Ember and the Ember community? (We have a lot in common with the Drupal community!)\nDemo of new open source modules to easily integrate Ember into a Drupal site, with the ability to gradually and progressively move small pieces of functionality from PHP to Javascript, while still taking advantage of a persistent, in-browser application.\nWalkthrough of extending a D8 site to show off animation, interactive editing, and offline capabilities (all source code provided)."
