description: 'Nowadays, everybody uses services in the cloud. When bringing your own services into the cloud, you may need to teach your colleagues or even advice your clients what''s the difference to on-premise machines. You may also want to test a few failure scenarios like power or network outages. Yet you aren''t allowed to enter a real cloud data center, and don''t even think of unplugging some cables... That''s why we have built a small data center that fits into a suitcase, to be able to hack on it. With this small data center you can teach, learn and understand what replaceable hardware means. The data center is built with Raspberry Pi 3 and the UP boards of the same size. So we can demonstrate how simple it is to bring up a Docker Swarm even with different CPU architectures like ARM 32 and 64bit as well as Intel 64bit. The containers, managed with Docker Swarm, are visualized with the Blinkt! LED strips attached to each node. This gives you a deeper insight what happens in failure scenarios. The tutorial to build the hardware and the demo Docker images are available in open source GitHub repos. So you are able to adjust the data center to your own ideas.'
