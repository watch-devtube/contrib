description: "Filmed at https://2018.dotscale.io on June 1st in Paris. More talks on https://www.dotconferences.com/talks\n\nIstio, we have a problem! We've just deployed a shiny new set of micro-services and it behaves in a strange manner. Hard to say why with so many moving parts...\n\nLet's leverage the newly installed service mesh to understand what we've deployed. Find the root problem. Fix it. And then do a proper, non trivial, blue-green deployment of the updated version.\n\nThat will involve the Service Graph, Prometheus monitoring, Grafana Dashboards, Traffic mirroring, all orchestrated in a simple manner by Istio."
