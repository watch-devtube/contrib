description: "by Brian Proffitt\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UB5.132/community_data_not_community_metrics.webm\n\n\nWe all recognize that metrics are key to measuring community health. And that quantitative data is a key to these metrics. But, as Brian Proffitt will describe in this talk, all the data in the world won't help you find answers if you don't know what the questions are. We all recognize that metrics are key to measuring community health. And that quantitative data is a key to these metrics. But, as Brian Proffitt will describe in this talk, all the data in the world won't help you find answers if you don't know what the questions are. Brian will walk attendees through what happens when pretty data can distract from the real purpose of metrics, and how his team course-corrected to seek out the questions before the answers. \n\nRoom: UB5.132\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 11:30:00+01"
