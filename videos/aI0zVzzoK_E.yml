description: 'This talk is about building Clojure/Clojurescript web applications with Datomic and DataScript. In addition to covering the basics of syncing data between client and server, we''ll look at how reactive Datalog queries simplify front end code, how Datomic''s flexible and queryable schema lets us describe UI with data, and how we can handle authorization in this setting. In closing, we''ll reflect on the big picture of this architecture in relation to current trends in FRP.'
