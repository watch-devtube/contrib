description: "How can we build AI that creates AI? This concept actually already exists! Google uses self-creating AI as part of its AutoML service that finds the best model for customers. Genetic algorithms and neuroevolutionary strategies offer us a way to replicate the process of natural selection en silico. I'll talk about ways of using machine learning algorithms to create better machine learning algorithms in this video. \n\nCode for this video (with coding challenge): \nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/neuroevolution-for-flappy-birds\n\nDer Waldi's Winning Code:\nhttps://github.com/DerWaldi/youtube-video-face-swap\n\nParamdeep's Runner up Code:\nhttps://github.com/ParmuSingh/face_swap\n\nPlease Subscribe!
