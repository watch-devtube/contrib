title: 'A reasonable overview of Java 9 and how you could think of it by Oleg S?elajev'
language: English
recordingDate: 1502440215
description: "The upcoming Java 9 release brings with it modularity, a new REPL, a new default garbage collector, HTTP 2 client, and much more. However, project Jigsaw requires so much of developer's attention that it's hard to see the true value of the upcoming release.\n\nIn this session we'll look at the features of Java 9 that developers not architects will face the most: welcome additions to the API: Optional, Date and Time, Stack walker, process management, collection literals (just kidding, they are factories of course), performance improvements, where to find the Unsafe and how to treat it after all. Is JShell a real tool or a toy to run fun one-liners?\n\nShould you rush to migrate to Java 9, as you did with the Java 8 and those sweet lambdas? Are multi-release jars nice or a point of pain?\n\nIn this session we'll try to answer whether it is all worth it and how could you proceed with it.\n\nOleg Šelajev is an engineer, author, speaker, lecturer and advocate at ZeroTurnaround. He is also kinda pursuing a PhD. Oleg enjoys hanging out with people, and participating in conferences like JavaOne, JavaZone, Devoxxes and others. In his free time, Oleg plays chess at a semi-grandmaster level, loves puzzles and solving all kinds of problems."
