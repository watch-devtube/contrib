It shares through federation, composes by refactoring and wraps data with visualization.\n\nThe Smallest Federated Wiki project wants to be small in the \"easy to learn powerful ideas\" version of small. It wants to be a wiki so that strangers can meet and create works of value together. And it wants to be federated so that the burden of maintaining long-lasting content is shared among those who care.\n\nWard Cunningham\n\nCunningham & Cunningham, Inc.\n\nCunningham is the Chief Inventor of AboutUs.org, a growth company hosting the communities formed by organizations and their constituents, and currently serves as the chairman of the technical advisory board for ZoomAtlas.
