description: "( Java Training - https://www.edureka.co/java-j2ee-soa-training )\nA parser is a piece of program that takes a physical representation of some data and converts it into an in-memory form for the program as a whole to use. Parsers are used everywhere in software. An XML Parser is a parser that is designed to read XML and create a way for programs to use XML. There are different types, and each has its advantages. Unless a program simply and blindly copies the whole XML file as a unit, every program must implement or call on an XML parser.\nThis video gives a brief insight of XML Parsers.Video also explains the difference between DOM and SAX Parser and Parsing XML using DOM and SAX Parser.\n\nHere are the related blogs:\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/understanding-java-hashmaps/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=xmlparse\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/methods-and-method-overloading-in-java/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=xmlparse\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/dynamic-data-allocation-in-java/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=xmlparse\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would prefer a hassle free and self paced learning  environment, accessible from any part of the world.\nThe topics related to 'XML Parsers' have extensively been covered in our 'JAVA/J2EE & SOA' course.\n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India: +91-8880862004"
