description: "Speaker: Dee Teal\n\nDrawing from my experience of project management in 2 of Australia’s biggest WordPress projects I will bring some of the lessons I learned about how to break down your project and how to prioritize the work you’re doing. This applies not only to the work you’re doing for your clients, or if you don’t work alone, for your team, but will also help inform decisions you make about where to put your efforts in projects outside of work as well. It’s a dive into the concepts of working selflessly, a kind of ethos that guides the WordPress project in its open source ideals. It can totally change your relationships with your clients and can make what you offer irresistible in the marketplace as people come to realize your focus is on THEIR success more than your own.\n\nEvent Page: https://2017.singapore.wordcamp.org/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/crpB/"
