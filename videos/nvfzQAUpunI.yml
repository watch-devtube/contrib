One of the topic in this new chapter is Safe Reclamation, which includes sections on: \n- Atomic specialization for shared_ptr \n- RCU \n- Hazard Pointers \n- Cell \n\nThere are several forms of Safe Reclamation that are now making their way through the C++ Standard Committee. The reference counting-based shared_ptr was introduced in C++11, and then Atomic Shared Pointer in Concurrency TS1. There are now proposals for Hazard Pointers, RCU, and Cell (an abstraction from Google that can build on top of all the other methods) have all advanced out of Study Group 1 (concurrency). Even better, all three proposals have accrued significant usage experience in production. \n\nOf course, both committee discussions and usage experience have resulted in fundamental changes to the proposals over the last two years. This talk will give an overview and the latest status of the proposals, then expand on the new aspects of hazard pointers and RCU. Some of these experiences are pointing to a bright future beyond lock-free programming towards fast and scalable essential concurrent data structures in demanding production environments. \n\nIn this talk, we will dissect each of these important components and compare and contrast their qualitative features and performance profiles. We will cover the features that will be included in C++20, and those on track for inclusion in Concurrency TS2. We will discuss the important changes from the C++ standardization process and how they may impact your usage. We will demonstrate examples of use of these technique. \n\nBeyond the current proposals, there are possible interface additions based on user experience in production. We will present newly added features to the hazard pointer method that expand its applicability to general concurrent data structures. The new interface is based on novel algorithmic additions to the method that use reference counting judiciously, with zero reader overhead and minimal writer overheads. We will show the usage of these interface expansions in common data structures, with code examples from the hazard pointer implementation in the Folly open-source library.\n— \nPaul McKenney, IBM Linux Technology Center, Beaverton\nDistinguished Engineer\n\nPaul E. McKenney is a Distinguished Engineer with the IBM Linux Technology Center, where he maintains the RCU implementation within the Linux kernel. He has been coding for four decades, more than half of that on parallel hardware. His prior lives include the DYNIX/ptx kernel at Sequent, networking protocols at SRI International, and work as a self-employed contract programmer on soft-realtime projects. His hobbies include what passes for running at his age and the usual house-wife-kids habit.\n\n\nMaged Michael, Facebook\nEngineer\n\nMaged Michael is a software engineer at Facebook. He is the inventor of hazard pointers, lock-free malloc and several algorithms for concurrent data structures. He received a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Rochester. He is an ACM Distinguished Scientist. He is an elected member of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering. He received the 2014 ACM SIGPLAN Most Influential PLDI Paper Award for his paper on Scalable Lock-Free Dynamic Memory Allocation.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
