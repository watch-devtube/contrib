description: "by Mahmoud Abdelghany\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/K.3.201/gamedev_java_games_doom3.webm\n\nAccording to the interwebs, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the multiverse.❮br/❯\nAnd yet, when it comes to games, its popularity seems to dwindle.\n\n\nWhy though...❮br/❯\nIs it really not suited for game development?❮br/❯\nIs the language as bad as the critics claim??❮br/❯\nIs GC...EVIL!?\n\n\nI have this side-project of porting Doom 3 from C/C++ to Java. And even though Doom 3 is a ~15 year old game, it is still a massive AAA code-base. So I believe my experiences there can adequately answer a lot of the questions that come to mind when you think of Java &amp; Games.\n\n\nDuring this talk, I will try to convince you that Java is a very viable game prototyping/development tool.❮br/❯\nEither that, or will add more fuel to the flame...\n\nRoom: K.3.201\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 13:05:00"
