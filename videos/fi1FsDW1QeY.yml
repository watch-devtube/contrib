description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2017\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nIn this talk I'll look at a unusual approach to designing internal interfaces and external APIs -- a \"capability-based\" approach that takes the Principle Of Least Authority and applies it to software design.\n\nWhen this approach is used, it produces a robust and modular design which captures the domain constraints, resulting in an API which is self-documenting and hard to misuse.\n\nI'll demonstrate how to design and implement a capability based approach, how capabilities can be quickly combined and restricted easily, and how capabilities are a natural fit with a REST API that uses HATEOAS."
