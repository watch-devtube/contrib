language: English
recordingDate: 1570813032
description: "Enterprise Java has come a long way. Let’s not focus on the old, darker days, but modern approaches on how to do enterprise applications. Where do we start? What technologies, tools, and approaches are a good choice for our applications and what allows us to effectively implement business logic and to deliver value to our users?\n\nIn this session, we’ll have a look at modern Enterprise Java projects, best practices, tools such as Maven, Docker, 12-factor apps, and more. We’ll see which enterprise technologies to choose from between Java EE, Jakarta EE, and MicroProfile, to fulfill the needs of our projects, how to design our projects and build effective development and deployment workflows. This session is aimed both at developers who are just starting out with Enterprise Java, as well as engineers who have seen the days of J2EE and who are wondering what the modern EE world looks like."
