recordingDate: 1531679785
description: "Microservices? At the Police? Definitely!\nAt the Cloud, Big Data and Internet division of the Dutch National Police, 4 DevOps teams use the latest open source technology to build high tech, cloud native web applications in a private cloud. These applications are used to support various types of police work with data from open, online sources and are built using Spring Boot, Angular 5, Spark, Kafka and Jenkins 2.\nIn this session, I'll share our experiences and real-world use cases for microservices. I値l explain our architecture, why we chose it, which challenges we face and what this all brings us. I値l show how 4 teams work together on one product, loosely based on the models used by Spotify and Netflix, and I値l talk about how we apply the principles of DevOps and Continuous Delivery. I値l show how we handle security, build pipelines, test automation, performance tests, service discovery, automated deployments and monitoring.\nYou値l leave this session with an understanding of how this approach enables us to have the agility of a startup within the large Police organisation."
