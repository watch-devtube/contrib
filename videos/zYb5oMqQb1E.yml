description: "How to Make ITSM Your New Best Friend\n\nJayne Groll, Board Member, DevOps Institute\n\nCulture is undoubtedly one of the most critical aspects of any DevOps initiative. While much emphasis is placed on Continuous Delivery and the deployment pipeline, this session will demonstrate the need for an underpinning “Continuous People Pipeline” that helps individuals and teams recognize their contribution to the value stream while providing realistic approaches for continuous engagement. Topics will include an exploration of the human dynamics of change, opportunities for overcoming cultural debt and the basics of conflict management.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
