language: English
recordingDate: 1453818828
description: "As an expert you will be asked to facilitate the learning of others, not to mention your personal eternal learning in your field. Join an interactive session about how our brains accept new knowledge and store it for later use. Your take-away will be three-fold; how to chunk information you give to others, how to improve your own learning AND something to entertain with at dull parties.\n\nAino Corry is a teacher, a technical conference editor and retrospectives facilitator. She holds a masters degree and a ph.d. in computer science. She has 12 years of experience with Patterns in Software Development, and teaches OO design, software architecture and development in academia and industry. She also teaches how to teach Computer Science to teachers, and thus lives up to the name of her company; Metadeveloper. In her spare time, she runs and sings (but not at the same time).\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
