description: "Speaker: Ying Ka Ho\r\n\r\nWhat is the first book to read on the first day as a Developer? A developer has recommended that a book by Uncle Bob called \"The Clean Coder\" should be the book to be read by new developers, but is it necessary?\r\nIn this book talk I give a review of the book called \"The Clean Coder\" by Robert C. Martin with respect to the structure of the book and the contents in it.\r\n\r\nAbout Ka Ho:\r\nI've been a software engineer for at least four years programming in C# and Java. Having acquired knowledge in machine learning, I'm in the process of transition to the field of Data Science, driven by my fundamental strength in Mathematics, Statistics and Computing. The truth is, if you know how things go about in Data Science, you can technically make Data Science and Engineering go together.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/252272100/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/kT6w/"
