description: "http://velocityconf.com\nWebPageTest is one of our favourite tools but testing your website's performance from different locations around the globe can be a laborious exercise in manual testing or writing your own custom scripts to talk to the WebPageTest API. WorldwidePageTest.com gives you the ability to test from your selection of locations around the world and see the performance visualised in a map view, from your choice of locations.\n\names Smith\nDevOpsGuys\nJames has worked as a software development consultant for over 15 years. He's designed, built and deployed eCommerce systems for Dell, Pizza Hut, KFC and the RAC which transact millions of orders and over $150 million in revenue every year. Like all Welshmen, James is a devout rugby supporter and combines this love with his love of Belgian Trappist beers."
