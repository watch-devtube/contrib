description: "When to use Machine Learning: Tips, Tricks and Warnings\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - Fintry [PyData]]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Pascal van Kooten\n\nArtificial Intelligence, and machine learning in particular, is one of the hottest topics in tech/business.\nI will explain the core of machine learning, and the main goal of this talk will be to help you judge the success whenever someone yells \"I know! let's solve this using machine learning!\". I will also provide tips and tricks on how to increase the success of such projects. The second part of the talk will be about 2 open-source python projects I've created, as well as a project I'm working on regarding the trading of cryptocurrency... and their relation to machine learning. Specifically, the challenges and findings in making these cases work will be explored.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
