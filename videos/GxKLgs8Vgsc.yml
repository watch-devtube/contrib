description: "If Javascript has taught me anything it is that when something goes wrong, only computers can use the excuse that they are “just following orders”. Though our code is interpreted literally by our machines, our intentions and unconscious biases are not. By looking at the various schools of ethics available to us, existing code of ethics for engineers, and the most pressing ethical dilemmas plaguing our industry today, we can make the world wide web a better place for everyone.\n\nOMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
