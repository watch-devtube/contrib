title: 'Sharing Code Between Web and Native Apps by Sebastian Witalec'
language: English
recordingDate: 1485133006
description: 'NativeScript has opened up a whole new world to Angular developers: the ability to share code—directly—between your web and native iOS/Android applications. Which is awesome! But, just because you can share code across multiple platforms, doesn’t mean that you necessarily should. In this talk we’ll first take a look at what NativeScript makes possible from a code sharing perspective. We’ll build a few Angular components and use them both in the browser and on mobile devices. Then we’ll take a step back and look at the same code from a pragmatic, maintenance-oriented perspective. Come for practical tips & tricks on sharing code across multiple development environments.'
