description: 'VR is the next great storytelling medium. People can now experience and truly be inside of stories and places in a way that isn’t possible with a 2d screen, and goes beyond just a linear narrative. VR makes it possible not just to transport people to another world, but to take people to amazing places inside of this world. Learn about Jump and how you can bring captured content together with narrative game design to bring people inside of your stories.'
