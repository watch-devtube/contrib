Kumar.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIndia's impact on the global economy has increased significantly over the past two decades as a result of the rapid growth that followed its economic reforms. Investors and multinational businesses have undoubtedly been drawn to India's affordable, highly skilled workforce. India's improved business climate has spurred the United States to become India's largest trading partner and largest investment partner.\n\nBut the potential of this strategic partnership has not been fully realized. Can bilateral trade and investment increase in this post--economic crisis world? Will the United States continue to inspire Indian entrepreneurship and be a magnet for Indian talent? Will India's economic reforms continue to receive support in the absence of inclusive growth, and what implications would this have for the economic relationship between the United States and India?\n\nKrishna Kumar is a senior economist at the RAND Corporation, where he directs Research and Policy in International Development (RAPID) within RAND Labor and Population. His research and teaching interests are economic growth and development, human capital accumulation, and technological change. Kumar has analyzed the Indian and Chinese education systems, the role of public policy on Indian entrepreneurship, higher education policies in the United States, reasons for U.S.-Europe productivity differences, the effect of tax reform on economic growth, international capital flows, the effect of the Green Revolution on recipient and donor countries, and policies to revive the stagnant sub-Saharan African economies. He leads the Rosenfeld Program on Asian Development at the Pardee RAND Graduate School and teaches global economics at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University and the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. Kumar received his Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago."
