description: "Google I/O 2010 - Unleash your map data: Cloud computing for geospatial applications \r\n\r\nGeo 101 \r\n\r\nTom Manshreck \r\n\r\nThe Google Maps API made geospatial development accessible to all but hosting your data remains complex and time consuming. This session will detail the services Google offers for storing your geospatial data in the cloud, illustrate the ways in which that data can be accessed and visualized, and walk through development of a retail store finder using these technologies. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
