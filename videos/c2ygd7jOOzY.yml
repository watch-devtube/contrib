description: "GitHub is for designers too. Push your projects forward by starting feature-centric discussions on GitHub. This webcast talk covers the maybe-not-so-obvious ways Git & GitHub can improve your design workflow.\n\nAbout Julie Horvath\n\nI'm a designer and frontend developer at GitHub. I like to think of myself as an open source advocate with a big heart for making mockups in markup. I spend a lot of my time speaking at conferences and volunteering to teach (more) women to code. \n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
