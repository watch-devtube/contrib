title: 'JetBrains MPS as a Tool for Extending Java (Vladimir Kozhaev, Freelancer)'

description: 'etBrains MPS is an integrated environment for language engineering. It allows language designers to define new programming languages, both general-purpose and domainspecific, either as standalone entities or as modular extensions of already existing ones. Since MPS leverages the concept of projectional editing, non-textual and non-parseable syntactic forms are possible, including tables or mathematical symbols. This lecture introduces MPS and shows how its novel approach can be applied to Java development.'
