description: "Redux has grown in popularity within the React community as an alternative to Flux and a powerful way to manage within your application. From its focus on immutability, pure functions or time traveling, it's become a popular way to back your React applications.\n\nBut Redux is more than a React library, it's a powerful pattern for data management in any kind of application.\n\nIn this session we're going to dive deeply into how Redux works, look at why it's so popular with React, how it can work with any front-end framework and even beyond JavaScript."
