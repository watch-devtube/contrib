description: "Agile development is a powerful tool for the creation of high-quality software products. It has however scared the life out of many security managers and risk leaders. Once the job of a dedicated security team, security is now the responsibility of all members of our Agile teams.\n\nSo how do we bring continuous security to our lifecycles without compromising velocity and innovation? What tools and techniques do we need and when should we apply them?\n\nIn this talk, we will examine why security is the new key skills for successful Agile development teams and what you can do to bring it to your teams.\n\nThis is a talk of war stories from the SCRUM team trenches and real world tools, techniques and processes that are less about 'managing' security than they are about building amazing(secure) things, fast."
