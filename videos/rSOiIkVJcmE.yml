description: 'As developers, we know things break. We also know how to fix them. What we don''t do is do this efficiently. Instead we seem to have a perverse fascination telling one another and the world how broken things are. If you look, however, how cool technology is these days, what tools we have at our disposal and the latest changes in the last excuse we had: "What about IE?" it is time to stop complaining and get to work. Our job is to build things that people want to use. Not to complain about our tools. This is what people looking for excuses do. We''re better than that.'
