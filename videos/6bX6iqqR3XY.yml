description: "A Google TechTalk, 3/12/18, presented by Michael Stapelberg\nABSTRACT:  In this talk, I will use the widely-known Kinesis Advantage keyboard as an example to explain how keyboards work, and why I have been using a custom keyboard controller for the last 5 years.\n\nAfter establishing the basics, I will examine and eliminate contributors to input latency, which is delay between pressing a key and your computer reacting to it. My controller has an input latency of merely 0.2ms, which makes it the fastest keyboard in the world (to the best of my knowledge).\n\nWith this knowledge, I build a latency measurement device and measure the processing latency of current Linux machines."
