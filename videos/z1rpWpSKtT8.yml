description: "Speaker:  Michael Plod, Independent Consultant\nSlides:https://speakerdeck.com/mploed/pivotal-webinar-why-do-i-recommend-spring\n\nIs Spring the new legacy as quite a few people tell you on their blogs? I disagree on many levels. Throughout this session I will holistically detail without any polemics why I do recommend using the Spring Framework and its ecosystem. Aspects that will be covered include: operational impacts, ecosystem, coding and road maps. This presentation is aimed at IT managers, Architects and Developers alike.\n\nFollow Michael on Twitter @bitboss for more great talks!\nLearn more about Spring IO: http://spring.io\nLearn more about Spring Boot: http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot"
