description: "On November 30 was released the 4.0 version of Symfony. No doubts, that's the best version of Symfony released until now. However, being an early adopter has some caveats when trying to integrate some popular bundles that may not have a stable release compatible with SF4.\nThrough this talk, we'll create a small api that integrates some popular bundles and authentication. We'll use these bundles:\n- FOSUserBundle\n- FOSRestBundle\n- NelmioApiDoc\n- EasyAdminBundle\n\nOur API will be authenticated using Json Web Tokens (JWT) to secure every existing endpoint.\n\nLet's dive together into the best Symfony ever and you'll learn the building blocks to create great Symfony apps using the best version of Symfony!"
