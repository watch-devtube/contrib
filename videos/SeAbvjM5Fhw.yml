description: "https://2018.jsconf.is/speakers/martin-kleppe/\n\nIn Greek mythology, Daedalus (Greek: Δαίδαλος \"to work artfully\") was a skillful craftsman and artist who created the first Labyrinth. People like him still exist and are known as creative coders and code golfers. They push the limits of what is possible with JavaScript and open new doors for others.\n\nFollow Martin on his journey through a maze of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML where the boundaries between art and code are blurred. This entertaining talk will show off invisible code, tweet-sized games, Asian programs, symmetric JavaScript, polyglot inceptions, self-modifying functions, exotic symbols and much more mind-blowing examples."
