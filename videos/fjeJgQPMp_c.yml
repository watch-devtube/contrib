description: "http://www.slideshare.net/AgileLietuva/managing-project-performance-alignment-of-agile-and-traditional-metrics\n\nWhile working in the IT industry for 6 years, Laimonas has gained an extensive experience and knowledge by managing a wide range of projects varying from software development and software as a service, to IT security and infrastructure implementation. Currently he works for a challenging multicultural, multinational CSC company where with the help of virtual teams delivers multiple projects to corporate clients. A strong Agile background gives him a unique chance to employ Agile methods within the organization that has been committed to a traditional project management for over 50 years. Laimonas is a Certified Scrum Product Owner, and holder of CompTIA Project+ project management certificate.\n\nManaging project performance: alignment of Agile and traditional metrics\nManaging project performance is never an easy thing to do. The speech will align two different ways of doing it: Agile and traditional one, which is based on still the mostly used project management standard - PMBOK. This session will not learn you about Agile and PMBOK metrics. It rather will demonstrate how to interpret traditional project metrics aligning them with agile project metrics.\n\nPrerequisites: good understanding of Agile Scrum methodology and metrics, as well as good understanding of AC, EV, SPI, CPI and other traditional project management metrics."
