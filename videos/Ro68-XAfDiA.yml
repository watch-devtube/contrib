description: "Trust the Hamster! - Peter Goetz & Norman Sutorius, IBM\n\nOver the past two years the Bits-Service, a Cloud Foundry Blobstore API, has been developed and is ready for action! Bits-Service started as an extraction of existing functionality in the Cloud Controller today by externalising all bits related operations (application bits, droplets, packages, buildpacks, …). So it's time for an update on Bits-Service. We would like to lay out the drivers behind Bits-Service, give updates on \"What's new?\", \"What's different?\", \"What to expect from Bits-Service?\", and why we rewrote it in Go.\nFinally, there will be an outlook on resource-matching in the CF V3 API as well as future development plans. And what exactly does all this have to do with a hamster?\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyP/trust-the-hamster-peter-goetz-norman-sutorius-ibm"
