description: "This session discusses the evolution of Gilt’s microservice architecture, the problems it has solved, and the challenges Gilt faces today. How do you move a large microservice deployment to the cloud? How do microservices affect ownership and software quality? Why do APIs really matter? How can the microservice approach be applied to front-end web applications? And why has Gilt’s adoption of microservices led the company to the conclusion that all of its teams should prefer to deploy and test software in production?\n\nSpeaker:\nAdrian Trenaman, SVP, Engineering, Gilt\nAde leads the engineering teams for Gilt in US and Ireland.
