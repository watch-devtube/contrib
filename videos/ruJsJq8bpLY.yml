description: "Marcus Hirt, Consulting Member of Technical Staff, Oracle\nMiroslav Wengner, Senior Software Engineer, MAN Truck & Bus AG\n\nRobo4J is an up-and-coming open source framework for quickly building robots with popular, often inexpensive, off-the-shelf hardware and the Java SE platform. A good example is Coff-E, an autonomous, partly 3D-printed, robot using a Raspberry Pi for brains. This session shows how to get started with Robo4J to build simple robotic systems with the nascent Robo4J framework. It also presents examples of how Robo4J is being used at MAN Truck & Bus AG. After the session, you should have a good sense of how to quickly configure and run a hardware system of your own. You’ll get\n• An overview of the Robo4J framework\n• An overview of the Robo4J tools\n• Useful source code examples"
