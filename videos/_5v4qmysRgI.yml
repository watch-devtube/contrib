description: 'We''ll look at how to architect and build a serverless platform and what makes something "serverless". We will dive into the design patterns for serverless applications and how container management solutions must be architected around user requirements. We will dive deep into how existing cloud-based serverless platforms leverage containers, how they''re scheduled, managed, and sandboxed. We''ll also look at what improvements we might expect or desire of new and existing serverless platforms.'
