description: "Keynote: Service Broker Management Across Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - Florian Müller, Technical Lead Platform Foundation & Services, SAP Cloud Platform \n\nThe Open Service Broker API sets the standard for how a single instance of Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, and other platforms create services instances and bind those instances to applications. But managing which services are available across multiple instances of those platforms is a challenge when there are hundreds of potential services that need to be managed across thousands of platform instances.\n\nThis demo presents the Service Manager as a central service broker registry for Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. I will show how the registration of a service broker at the Service Manager is propagated down to a Cloud Foundry Cloud Controller and a Kubernetes Service Catalog.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FW16/keynote-service-broker-management-across-cloud-foundry-and-kubernetes-florian-muller-technical-lead-platform-foundation-services-sap-cloud-platform"
