title: '"A Theory of Everything" by Johnny Ray Austin'

description: "In physics, a \"Theory of Everything\" unifies the rules that govern the quantum (tiny) universe and the classical (big) universe. Just as such a theory has eluded physicists, software developers, too, lack a similar unifying view of the world. Backend development is seen as \"hardcore\" software engineering while front-end development is (erroneously) perceived as \"easier\" or somehow less of a discipline. We need a theory of everything that ties together the traditional computational approach of back-end development along with the user-facing interaction approach of front-end development. Database design meets UX design in a way that matters. Learn how to draw close connections between seemingly unrelated system components, thereby allowing you to better grasp the bigger picture for any project regardless of your role.\n\nSpeaker: Johnny Ray Austin"
