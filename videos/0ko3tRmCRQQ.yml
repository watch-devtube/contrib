Additionally,\nrecently several related organizations have jumped into the the role of\nhelping sustain open source by providing (for a fee) funding conduits,\nfundraising services, or other mechanisms to route money to maintainers.\nAffirmative position: FOSS benefits from sustainability efforts\n\n\n❮ol❯\n❮li❯First Affirmative Constructive (1AC) = 7 minutes\na.
