description: "Christopher Jones - Software Engineer, IBM\nChristy Perez - Software Engineer, IBM\n\nWe live in a multi-platform world, and who doesn't want their project to run on all of them? The last few DockerCon events have covered the introduction of multi-platform image capabilities into the Docker registry and engine releases. Now it's time to put these features to good use building applications across architectures and running them all in a heterogeneous Docker Swarm! In this talk we'll cover the new `docker manifest` command for making multi-architecture images; how to emulate architectures in docker containers on your own machine; and give a live demonstration of these capabilities with a Docker Swarm consisting of workers of different CPU architectures, including armhf, ppc64le, s390x, and x86_64. We'll also share some pointers for making sure your project is multi-platform ready! Three Takeaways: 1. Attendees will be introduced to manifest lists and how to create multi-arch images using the new 'docker manifest' command. 2. Attendees will learn how to easily create and deploy a basic multi-arch service using multi-platform images. 3. Bonus: Attendees will learn how to run non-native docker containers on their systems."
