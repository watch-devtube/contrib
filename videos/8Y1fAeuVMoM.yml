recordingDate: 1412206277
description: "Originally recorded on June 19, 2014.  So you want to create a platform for your product? Creating a fantastic open API (or even a closed one) is not the same as creating other products. In this webcast led by Kirsten Jones, you'll learn what you need to know to design, plan and execute a successful, engaging API and how to avoid common pitfalls.\n\nAbout Kirsten Jones:\nKirsten Jones is an unapologetic hacker and passionate advocate for the development community. Her technical interests range from graph databases to cloud services, and her experience supporting and evangelizing REST APIs has given her a unique perspective on developer success. In her copious free time she's a gamer, fantasy reader, and all around rabble-rouser. Code samples, recipes, and philosophical musings can be found on her blog, Princess Polymath.\n\nDon't miss an upload! Subscribe! http://goo.gl/szEauh - \nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media.
