But what if this infrastructure was also available as the underpinning for your next Cloud Foundry deployment?  Join the Google team as they illustrate how they expose Google Cloud Platform to Cloud Foundry developers and their applications.\n\nAbout Colleen Briant\nColleen has been at Google for 3 months, developing a Service Broker for Google Cloud Platform. Prior to Google, Colleen worked at a variety of startups as a full-stack software developer. 2 of those startups were in the travel space, and the most recent was acquired by Booking.com.\n\nAbout Eric Johnson\nTech Lead/Manager, Google"
