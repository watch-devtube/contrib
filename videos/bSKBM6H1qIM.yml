A good product based on good programming is important, of course. A common philosophy of quality in software helps keep the project on track. Also important is a community that welcomes \"new blood\", facilitates interaction, and fosters the development of its members. Based on interviews with leading developers and community leaders, we look at how these factors have influenced the growth of Python into one of the most popular programming languages.\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCjk/"
