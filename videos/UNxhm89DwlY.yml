title: 'You build it, you run it (why developers should also be on call) - Chris O''Dell'
recordingDate: 1518772579
description: "Development of a feature doesn稚 stop at deployment, your involvement continues for the lifetime of the product. If you want great power to control the choice of tooling and approaches, then you accept the great responsibility of ensuring it works, and remains working, in Production.\n\nIn this talk I値l explore the topic of Developers supporting their own features in Production. I値l cover the benefits of this approach, including greater understanding of your product, its usage and performance, and how this data can be fed back to improve your product. I値l also talk about the downsides of being on-call, combined with the strategies from Ops teams on how to handle these. You値l come away from this talk feeling empowered to own your own work."
