description: "Speaker: Pramod Sadalage (@pramodsadalage), Developer @ ThoughtWorks\n\nTo get full benefits of continuous Delivery, all components of the software being developed need to be delivered at the same pace. Components of the software development like databases need different techniques to be managed . Techniques that that would have to cater to changes being deployed to the database along with code and at the same time be enable the database to handle multiple versions of the application software.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nPramod Sadalage is principal consultant at ThoughtWorks where he enjoys the rare role of bridging the divide between database professionals and application developers. He is usually sent in to clients with particularly challenging data needs, which require new technologies and techniques. In the early 00's he developed techniques to allow relational databases to be designed in an evolutionary manner based on version-controlled schema migrations. He is the co-author of Refactoring Databases, co-author of NoSQL Distilled and continues to speak and write about the insights he and his clients learn.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/player/e83684871d5a415d8cf06ea1cec0fd01?feature=oembed\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.agilesingapore.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/XvBg/"
