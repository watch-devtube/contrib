But also, that data, IoT and digitization has the potential of connecting products and services into future comprehensive solution offerings in different internal and external ecosystems, but also, that it will come to challenge all functions and disciplines of the company in how they are organized, and in how they work. Husqvarna Group is though off to a good start, having got both Husqvarna Fleet Services and Gardena SMART already on the market, and during passed year, the Group has also tested a new concept within the field of sharing economy.
