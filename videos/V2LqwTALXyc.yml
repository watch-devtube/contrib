description: "The last five years have seen a dramatic change in the makeup of the application stack.\n\nWhat was typically a cookie-cutter affair of bare metal servers running a monolithic application server talking to a relational database, is now an exotic mix of architectures, platforms, data stores, and languages.\n\nThis talk explores the four most important trends that are influencing how the application stack is changing.\n\nWide availability of cloud infrastructure opens the door to new architectural styles while facilitating easier, faster and cheaper access to large-scale compute resources. As developers we need to be familiar with the wealth of cloud options available and be comfortable with how we can apply them to solve our problems.\n\nThe acceptance of polyglot applications affects the stack in a great many ways. Not only are applications being written in multiple languages, but there is now a much wider selection of middleware components to chose from. Developers now need to understand more than just Java or C# to get by.\n\nThe NoSQL movement has yielded a great selection of relational database alternatives.  From key-value stores to document-oriented databases, developers now have an important choice to make when assessing how to handle their data requirements.\n\nThe rise of DevOps has increased the importance of integrating development and operations. As a developer, an understanding of how your systems are managed and monitored is critical. Projects and Chef, Puppet and MCollective mean that developers now have an important role to play in creating an effective operations organisation.\n\n\n\n\nLiked the song?
