description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nDavid Leibs - Member of the \"Virtual Machine Research Group\" at Oracle Labs\n\nABSTRACT\nWe are taught to program computers by using branching, loops and accumulators. When we write our loops we also mix in all sorts of other concerns. This makes for a very difficult situation re parallelization. I will present some ideas from the famous Array Programming languages APL and J and make the case that learning Array Thinking should be in your future.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
