description: "While we’re drawing ever closer to Java 9, and even hearing about features in Java 10, it’s also true that many of us are still working with an older version. Even if your project has technically adopted Java 8, and even if you’re using it when coding new features, it’s likely the majority of your code base is still not making the most of what’s available in Java 8 - features like Lambda Expressions, the Streams API, and new Date/Time.\n\nIn this presentation, Trisha will: - Highlight some of the benefits of using Java 8 - after all, you’ll probably have to persuade The Management that tampering with existing code is worthwhile - Demonstrate how to identify areas of code that can be updated to use Java 8 features - Show how to automatically refactor your code to make use of features like lambdas and streams. - Cover some of the pros and cons of using the new features, including the impact on performance. At the end of this session, you’ll have a better idea of when refactoring can easily be done, and when it may NOT be a good idea.\n\nTrisha Gee has developed Java applications for a range of industries, including finance, manufacturing, software and non-profit, for companies of all sizes. She has expertise in Java high performance systems, is passionate about enabling developer productivity, and dabbles with Open Source development. Trisha is a leader of the Sevilla Java User Group, a MongoDB Master and a Java Champion. She believes we shouldn't all have to make the same mistakes again and again. She’s a Developer Advocate for JetBrains so she can share all the cool stuff she's discovered so far.\n\n[URM-2795]"
