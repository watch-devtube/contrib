title: 'Developing desktop and mobile applications in HTML5 for Java Developers (Yakov Fain, USA), part 2'
language: Russian
recordingDate: 1406580676
description: 'This talk starts as an overview of different ways of developing front end of Web application in HTML/JavaScript/CSS. Java developers are accustomed to preparing HTML in Servlets, JSPs, JSF, or Spring framework. But the trend is to separate development of the front end in HTML5 and server side Java. This talk is a mix of slides and code review of several versions of the same application. We’ll start with architecture and code review of a basic HTML/JavaScript version of a sample charity application. After that we’ll switch to its jQuery version, then you’ll see how to do it with ExtJS framework, then we’ll cut this application into slices for modularization reasons. The second part of this presentation is about moving this application to mobile devices. You’ll see this application implemented with Responsive Design principles, and then two more versions: one with jQuery Mobile and the other with Sencha Touch.'
