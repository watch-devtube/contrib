description: "Why Do I Need Kubernetes When I Already Have Cloud Foundry? - Sanjay Patil, SAP\n\n Like many of you, several SAP teams have also been asking this question to themselves. While the answer is singular in some cases (either Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes), in many situations, there is room or rather a need for both these technologies. In this session, you will learn why several SAP teams have adopted Kubernetes / container model for developing comprehensive solutions (more than what a typical ‘cf push’ can handle) and deploying them on-premise and/or in the cloud. Some of these Kubernetes based solutions are also exposed as services in Cloud Foundry environment, whereby Cloud Foundry applications can consume them via the simple and familiar service binding paradigm. \n\nAbout Sanjay Patil\nSanjay Patil is a Product Manager of SAP Cloud Platform, a certified Cloud Foundry PaaS solution. With his passion and decade-long experience with Open Standard technologies, Sanjay has been closely involved in creation and launch of the Cloud Foundry Foundation.
