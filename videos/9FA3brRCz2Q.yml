description: "Evolving Dart: Leaving the ocean and learning to fly\n\nFrom its origins as a language that was designed around being a fairly dynamic, just-in-time compiled browser language, Dart is evolving towards being a more statically typed, ahead-of-time compilation friendly language with killer support for writing user interface intensive client side code. Learn more about how Dart has been changing, and how we see it continuing to evolve over the next few years.\n\nAbout Leaf: Leaf Petersen is a software developer at Google, working on the Dart language. His background is in optimizing compilers and type systems.\n\nWatch the rest of the Dart Conference 2018 session videos here: https://goo.gl/4bwhE5\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
