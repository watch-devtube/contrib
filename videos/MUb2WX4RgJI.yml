description: "Intro: Prometheus – Richard \"RichiH\" Hartmann, SpaceNet & Frederic Branczyk, CoreOS \n\nJoin Prometheus maintainers to learn about the design, project goals and history of Prometheus. We will cover basic concepts of Prometheus to enable you to get an understanding of what all the hype is about. We will start at what time series are and what makes them different, look at our non-hierarchical data structure, our exposition format, and tie it all together with our query language, PromQL? As the end, you will have a solid understanding of Prometheus, enabling you to start using it in production. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/H8lo"
