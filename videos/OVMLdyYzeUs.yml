description: "Istio Birds of a Feather - Christopher Luciano, IBM & Shannon Coen, Pivotal\n\nThis session will be an informal discussion on how software engineers and operators envision leveraging Istio/Envoy within the Cloud Foundry stack. Istio supports various service discovery adapters that are familiar to CF users including Consul and Eureka; Cloud Foundry adapters are still a work-in-progress. The goal is to poll the audience and gather feedback on how these solutions could best integrate and support Cloud Foundry environments without exposing unnecessary complexity to an end user. Istio/Envoy contributors will facilitate the discussion with a gentle Istio introduction followed by unconference style discussion with the audience.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyc/istio-birds-of-a-feather-christopher-luciano-ibm-shannon-coen-pivotal"
