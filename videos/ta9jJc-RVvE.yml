description: "Weave & Chick-fil-A: Managing Fleets of Kubernetes Clusters w/ GitOPs - Sean Drucker, Chick-fil-A, Inc. & Alexis Richardson, Weaveworks \n\nGitOps provides an operating model for managing multiple Kubernetes clusters at scale. In this session, Chick-fil-A and Weave will share examples from our production experience running many K8s clusters. Weave operates a global SaaS product in the cloud using Kubernetes. Chick-fil-A is running Kubernetes clusters at the Edge in restaurants. Both companies have solved the challenges of managing many clusters by combining Kubernetes' natural affinity for declarative infrastructure and its well-defined objects with Git to develop a management technique called “GitOps\". D50In this session, you will learn what GitOps is and how it can help you D50effectively manage and monitor your Kubernetes clusters. We will share about the projects we have built to solve common management problems like CI/CD, K8s object generation, configuration management/drift, and observability of the stack. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrXv"
