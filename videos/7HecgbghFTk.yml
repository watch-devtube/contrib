title: 'J.B. Rainsberger ''The Economics of Software Design'''
recordingDate: 1319497320
description: "That is how J.B. Rainsberger describe the theme of his speech:\r\n\r\nEvery month, someone new asks me the question, \"How do I convince my manager to let me refactor?\" While it's true that a manager shouldn't constrain the programmer's plans to deliver high-quality code, the fact remains that some organisations allow their managers to assert this level of micro-control. In this talk I outline a set of models for justifying evolutionary design with basic economic concepts that relate directly to delivering, planning, and funding software projects. This talk will provide you with a solid argument to meet any skeptic's rational objections to writing tests first and letting both low-level design and architecture emerge."
