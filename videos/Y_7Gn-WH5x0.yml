title: 'GopherCon 2018: Ron Evans - Computer Vision Using Go and OpenCV 3'
language: English
recordingDate: 1536936362
description: "It is easier to see what comes next for the Internet of Things (IoT) when you have eyes on the world. Computer Vision (CV) software, in particular the open source OpenCV (http://opencv.org) has made big leaps in power and usability, and is ready to come into its own as a key part of an advanced IoT solution.\n\n\nAt the same time, the Go programming language, a.k.a. Golang, has won over fans with clean code, high-performance, and portability. But there has not been any way to unlock the most state-of-the-art CV libraries using the most state-of-the-art programming language... until now.\n\n\nIntroducing GoCV (https://gocv.io)... a new package for letting Go programmers create computer vision applications using OpenCV. In this talk, Ron will show how to use GoCV to build the next generation of computer vision applications, with live code demonstrations including a Tensorflow enabled drone."
