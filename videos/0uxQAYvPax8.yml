description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Jeff Scott Brown\nMore Groovy Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/runtime-metaprogrammingwithgroovy\nThe dynamic runtime nature of Groovy is one of the things that sets it apart from standard Java and makes it a fantastic language for building dynamic applications for the Java Platform. The metaprogramming capabilities offered by the language provide everything that an application development team needs to build systems that are far more capable than their all Java counterparts."
