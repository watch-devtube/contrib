recordingDate: 1282595186
description: "Leonard Lobel guides you through detailed demos that showcase the new \"beyond relational\" features introduced in Microsoft SQL Server 2008.\n\nWe cover FILESTREAM, and learn how database developers can now enjoy the native ability to store large binary objects in the file system with full transactional integrity. We also build several applications that integrate location-awareness by leveraging the new geospatial data types. Finally, we see how to use the new hierarchyid data type to cast a hierarchical structure over any relational table against which you can easily perform hierarchical queries and tree manipulations."
