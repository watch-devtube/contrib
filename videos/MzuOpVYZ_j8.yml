description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMarcus Lagergren - Co-author of Oracle JRockit\n\nABSTRACT\nThis is a highly technical session about dynamic languages on the JVM. Marcus Lagergren discusses the performance challenges encountered during the implementation of Oracle's Nashorn project: a 100% ECMAScript compliant JavaScript implementation on top of the JVM, open source and available in Java 8. We will look at how the biggest paradigm shift in the history of the JVM specification, the invokedynamic bytecode, available as of Java 7, and how it was put to use to get performance in an environment where traditionally the JVM has been lacking. The JVM is becoming more and more feasible as a polyglot runtime, and this session will explain why. We will cover the Nashorn project in some detail, but mostly concentrate on ongoing dynamic language research in the Java team. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
