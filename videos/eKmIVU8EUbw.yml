description: "This video will get you up and running with your first movie recommender system in just 10 lines of C++. We train a neural network on a MovieLens dataset of movie ratings by different users to generate a top 10 recommendation list for the default user ID. \n\nThe code for this video is here (everything included):\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Movie_Recommender\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nThe Original Amazon DSSTNE code is here:  \nhttps://github.com/amznlabs/amazon-dsstne\n\nLink to AWS:\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/\n\nLink to FileZilla:\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/\n\nPaper I found pretty cool (a deep learning based rec system):\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.2944.pdf\n\nAnd a correction -- Scott grand recently tested it vs Tensorflow and reported not just a 2x, but a 15x speedup:\nhttps://medium.com/@scottlegrand/first-dsstne-benchmarks-tldr-almost-15x-faster-than-tensorflow-393dbeb80c0f#.loze1hltg\n\nI love you guys! Thanks for watching my videos, I do it for you. I left my awesome job at Twilio and I'm doing this full time now. \n\nI recently created a Patreon page. If you like my videos, feel free to help support my effort here!:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?ty=h&u=3191693\n\nMuch more to come so please subscribe, like, and comment.\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
