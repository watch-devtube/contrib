description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA.\nSpeaker: Matt Stine\nThis session will focus on how you can build your very own Cloud Foundry private PaaS running in your own data center or on AWS or even on OpenStack on your own Mac mini. You will learn how the Cloud Foundry BOSH tool constructs a full Cloud Foundry instance from a bare bones virtual machine and continues to coordinate and manage the entire PaaS cloud once it is operational. If you want the convenience of developing against your own private custom PaaS within your company, then this session will give you all the steps you need to get started.\n\nLearn more about using CloudFoundry at:\nhttp://www.cloudfoundry.com/use"
