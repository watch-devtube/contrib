description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nThis presentation tells a story of a hackathon project where mixing a cool idea with the latest technologies resulted in the grand prize and the fan favourite award of the IBM Sparkathon with nearly 600 participants. It will describe the key technologies used and how they were effectively combined in a short period of time. Psst... it will also share a secret recipe for a success in a hackathon... but don't tell anyone!"
