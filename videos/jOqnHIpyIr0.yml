description: "Alfred Spector, Jeff Dean, Peter Norvig, Thad Starner \n\nResearch at Google is unique, as it is conducted across the entire Engineering organization - by Research Scientists as well as Software Engineers.  Teams are integrated, boundaries are fluid, and we face challenges together while retaining a close feedback loop from our users. This enables us to quickly build, iterate, and launch new and innovative products that change the state of the art and thereby produce new research results.  Google's definition of research is broad and happens in multiple ways across the organization.  Our research results in technology advances in the areas of Audio/Video Fingerprinting, Image Understanding, MapReduce/Parallel Computing, Deep Learning, and Parsing at Scale, which we apply to many of our products.  And, it also results in new whole new products, such as Voice Search and Google Translate. Learn about Google's hybrid approach to research from the engineers and scientists behind ideas such as Google Glass, MapReduce, Search, and online education, who conduct big idea experiments that translate into real-time innovation at Google.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
