The same applies for Java concurrency utilities and a tool called Java Concurrency in Practice was created to address this issue a few years back and following its trail a similar tool called Java Security Animated is aiming to lower the entry barrier to security portfolio of the Java platform. Using the tool we will have a journey in the security world of the platform."
