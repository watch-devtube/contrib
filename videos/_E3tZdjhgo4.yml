description: 'The dark-web including TOR, FreeNet and I2P, is that part of the Internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines and where anonymity and confidentiality is enforced at the root. For these characteristics, cyber- criminals started abusing the dark-web to conduct illicit or malicious activities like illegal trading, malware hosting, and more recently targeted attacks. In this talk, we explore the cyber-criminal ecosystem in the dark-web and provides insights on its activities against hidden services and other users.'
