description: 'Kubernetes abstracts and simplifies many aspects configuring and scaling infrastructure, but still requires DevOps. Building CI/CD pipelines to correctly deploy to Kuberentes clusters is a time-consuming process. In this webinar, we''ll look at how GitLab is thinking about "CI/CD as code" with versionable and template-able pipelines. With re-usable code snippets, we''ll show how building pipelines can be simplified to just a few clicks while remaining fully customizable.'
