description: "Speaker: Martin Brochhaus\n\nMartin is currently working as the CTO of theartling.com and luxglove.com and is maintaining a codebase with ~30k lines of code and ~12k lines of tests. In this 45 minutes talk, he will show how you can setup your first Django test-suite with py.test, how you can create fixtures with mixer and how you can measure test coverage. He will also show common patterns and snippets that will help you overtake the initial hurdles of getting in to testing: How to speed up tests? How to mock third party libraries? How to test forms and class based views with Django's RequestFactory? How to test admin functions and management commands? How to test Django Rest Framework's API views and serializers?  \n\nEvent Page: http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Djangonauts/events/230920405/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/L4Qs/"
