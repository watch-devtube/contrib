description: "Embracing OCI and CNI Open Container Standards Between Garden & Friends - George Lestaris & Gabriel Rosenhouse, Pivotal, & Konstantinos Karampogias, Swisscom\n\nCloud Foundry supports a rich ecosystem of plugins and extension points at various levels of the stack. This modularity enables rapid development and deployment of new features. Garden-runC, the Linux container engine used by Cloud Foundry, adopted this kind of modular philosophy by introducing new exciting forms of extensibility in its core.\n\nIn this talk, members of three core engineering teams (Garden, GrootFS, and Container Networking) will introduce the APIs that enable pluggable filesystems and networking stacks, including support for the industry-standard Open Container Initiative (OCI) image format and the Container Networking Interface (CNI) specification. With these extension points, Cloud Foundry users and operators gain access to a rapidly-growing ecosystem of 3rd party features which can enable new use cases for the platform.\n\nAbout Konstantinos Karampogias\nKonstantinos has been working at Swisscom for the past two years as Software Engineer. He is currently a member of the Cloud Foundry Garden team in London, and before that he had a CF Dojo with the Container Networking team in Santa Monica.\n\nAbout George Lestaris\nGeorge Lestaris is the product manager of the Cloud Foundry GrootFS team, working at Pivotal in London. GrootFS is building tools to manage the container image lifecycle for Garden, CF's container engine. Before Pivotal, George spent some time with web programming, high throughput computing and cloud computing research. He has given talks before in CHEP 2013, PyCon UK 2015, CF Summit NA 2016, ContainerCamp LDN 2016 and Open Source Summit Japan 2017.\n\nAbout Gabriel Rosenhouse\nGabe is a software engineer at the Pivotal office in Santa Monica, California. He has been working on Cloud Foundry for 3 years with a focus on networking and security. He co-presented on the Container Networking project at CF Summit North America last year. In past lives, Gabe wrote software for low-cost 3D-printers and high-speed fluorescence microscopes."
