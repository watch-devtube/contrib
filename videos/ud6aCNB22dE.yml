title: 'Web application development with no front-end skills (Nicolas Fränkel, Switzerland)'

description: "Web Development requires many front-end skills: in the best case, it is an underpaid job, and in the worst, it is left to interns. Vaadin is a Java framework requiring only Java skills. It also offers many features including:\n \n - true Object-Oriented Programming (inheritance and composition)\n - an abstraction over Web request/response with Event-Driven Programming\n - data binding\n - server push\n\nEven better, Vaadin compiles to bytecode and if necessary, is extensible on the client-side. In this presentation I will demo those features to give a taste of how easy it is to develop with Vaadin."
