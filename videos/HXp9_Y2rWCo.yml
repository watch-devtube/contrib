title: 'Cloud Foundry: The Gaps - John Wetherill, BNY Mellon'
language: English
recordingDate: 1475944692
description: "BNY Mellon, the oldest bank in the US and one of the most influential financial institutions in the world, has made a firm commitment to Cloud Foundry as a key component of our cloud technology stack. The reasoning is clear: we are a financial institution focusing on financial problems, and don't want to be in business of building infrastructure and platform software, instead wanting to take advantage of open-source community-driven software so we can focus on our business challenges. \n\nCloud Foundry meets several of our requirements for a highly-available, flexible, secure, and scalable platform , but it's not a panacea and has some gaps that we are forced to fill using other technologies. Specifically these gaps include support for non-http workloads, service discovery, multi-datacenter orchestration and failover support, application grouping (assembly) concepts, OS support, and more. \n\nThis technical session will focus on many of these gaps that the open source Cloud Foundry platform currently doesn't cover, and will present in depth the solutions, including other open source software technologies, that we are building to fill those gaps, to deliver a flexible and reliable platform that fosters modern cloud practices including microservices, containerization, and continuous delivery. \n\nDevelopers, DevOps, sys-admins, and IT decision makers in any industry will benefit from the lessons we've learned. \n\nJohn Wetherill\nPrincipal Architect\nBNY Mellon\nJohn Wetherill, Principal Architect at BNY Mellon's Innovation Center in Palo Alto, spent much of his career designing and building software at a handful of startups, at Sun Microsystems, NeXT Inc., and in the smart grid and energy space. His biggest passion is for tools, languages, processes, and systems that improve developer productivity and quality of life. \n\nJohn has spent the last four years immersed in Cloud Foundry, and continues to focus on cloud technologies including PaaS, microservices, and containerization. At BNY Mellon he is helping drive the adoption of Cloud Foundry and related technologies across the bank."
