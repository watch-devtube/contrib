description: "Illustrated with many live demos, this session presents the main challenges a developer faces when developing an IoT solution. These challenges usually boil down to two actual topics: Connecting the devices, and Managing them\n\nWe will be presenting two popular IoT protocols, MQTT and CoAP, and the associated open source, industry-proven, Java implementations available as part of the Eclipse IoT projects portfolio (respectively Paho and Californium).\n\nWhen it comes to managing IoT devices on the field, there are many requirements that are often overlooked, like the ability to install new applications remotely, perform over-the-air software upgrades, update application settings, etc. Eclipse Kura is a Java/OSGi framework that allows to build smart IoT gateways that truly are manageable and the session will walk you through the main features of the framework.\n\nYou will leave the session with very concrete steps to start experimenting with the mentioned projects by yourself."
