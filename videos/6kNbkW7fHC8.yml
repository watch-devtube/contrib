recordingDate: 1433507749
description: "Open source components are literally everywhere, and along with incredible innovation, functionality, and cost savings comes security risk. This session provides details about known vulnerabilities in open source components and shares the results of recent Aspect Security research funded by the US Air Force Rome Laboratories (AFRL). Aspect Security created an intelligent engine that analyzes libraries automatically and identifies previously unknown hazards and vulnerabilities in components in a matter of minutes. The presentation shows you how dynamic bytecode instrumentation passively identifies these problems and provides clear, actionable guidance on how to use untrusted libraries safely. It also teaches you how to use free and open tools to improve the security of your libraries.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJeff Williams\nundefined\nView more trainings by Jeff Williams at https://www.parleys.com/author/jeff-williams\n\nBojan Simic\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Bojan Simic at https://www.parleys.com/author/bojan-simic\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
