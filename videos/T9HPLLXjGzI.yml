language: English
recordingDate: 1474421945
description: 'For many years, Servlet technology has been at the heart of Java EE/Enterprise Java. Also technologies associated with the cloud—such as containerization, microservices, REST, pay-per-use computing, and Continuous Delivery—have become more relevant. Companies have shifted from using app servers and associated deployment artifacts to newer models that take advantage of the cloud. So, what role can Servlets play in this new world? This session covers how Oracle is listening to the demands of the community to deliver a completed Servlet 4.0/ Java EE 8 that builds on existing strengths while enabling lighter-weight, cloud-ready, composable apps.'
