description: 'Let me tell you a real story of running serverless Java applications: - Maneuvering around limitations of AWS Lambda functions, but at the same time saving a lot of money on infrastructure. - Tuning your code for fast initialization to reduce cold start times and avoid timeouts in upstreams integrations. - Sharing experience with different languages like plain-old-Java, Groovy, Kotlin as well as frameworks like Spring and Micronaut. - Going through some operational overhead of managing resources that compose serverless environment with Terraform and Serverless.com framework. - Dealing with debugging and local testing of your functions. - Collecting and observing metrics and logging data.'
