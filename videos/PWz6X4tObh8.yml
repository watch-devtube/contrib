description: "Running Smart Apps on the Cloud Foundry Platform - Amith Nambiar, Pivotal\n\n\"A quick look at companies disrupting well-established industries reveals a number of common characteristics. Among the most important, they're all expert at delivering insights in context to their customers and users—and they do it by surfacing data-driven, actionable information via features in smart applications.\"\n\nThis talk will delve into the details of delivering an end to end smart app on the Cloud Foundry platform. I will start with an example app which uses Machine learning and describe the problems involved in making the insights from the predictions available to the end users. Then, I will go into the details of how to use Cloud Foundry's Platform as a service (PaaS) abstraction to run and scale the API's, use Container as a service (CaaS) abstraction to run Machine Learning workloads using Apache Spark and Serverless computing abstraction (FaaS - Project riff) to run event driven functions. Finally, I will talk about how these different abstractions connect and enable, a whole new set of apps with varied requirements, onto the platform.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyG/running-smart-apps-on-the-cloud-foundry-platform-amith-nambiar-pivotal"
