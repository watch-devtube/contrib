In order to use Akka at it's best, you will have to change the way you think about application design (loosen coupling in space and time between components), and re-think what you've maybe learnt in the past. In this talk we uncover a number of rules that serve as a guide in designing concurrent distributed applications, how those apply to Akka and how they can help you in daily app development."
