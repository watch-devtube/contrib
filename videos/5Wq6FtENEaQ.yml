description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA\nSpeakers:  Peter Bell (MongoDB Master), Costin Leau (Elasticsearch), Christoph Strobl (Solr) and Michael Nitschinger (Couchbase)\nSpring Data has started as an umbrella project consisting of many individual modules - per supported data store. While some of these data store modules - like the JPA and MongoDB ones - are maintained by Pivotal engineers a lot of community implementations have popped up lately. They build on the foundations of the Spring Data Core module and expose the Spring Data programming model for others stores.\n\nThe session will feature maintainers and contributors of the community modules for Solr (Christoph Strobl), Elasticsearch (Costin Leau), Couchbase (Michael Nitschinger) and MongoDB (Peter Bell), who will talk about the latest and greatest features of the upcoming releases and give an impression of how they used the APIs of Spring Data Core to build the module.\n\nSpring Data has stared as an umbrella project consisting of many individual modules - per supported data store.
