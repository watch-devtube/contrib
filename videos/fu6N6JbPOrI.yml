description: "Code: https://github.com/BorisSchaeling/worldclasscode\n\nIf I was to show you some code, give you a few minutes to review it - how would you determine whether you are looking at world-class C++ code? Is code sprinkled with initializer lists, smart pointers and lambdas code you would automatically call world-class? This talk uncovers the hidden rules of world-class C++ code the speaker has observed and learned in 15 years in the Boost C++ community and in his professional career in electronic trading."
