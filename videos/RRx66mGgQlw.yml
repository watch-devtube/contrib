recordingDate: 1297703282
description: 'Unit testing is one of those topics that sounds like a mandatory course in a computer science degree. Then again, the programmers already using unit tests spend less time debugging and more time building functional code. Dan Pilone breaks down why unit testing is important, but also how to add unit tests without falling asleep at the keyboard from boredom. You''ll also see how unit testing isn''t just a bonus feature, but actually improves the way you think about and program your iOS applications.'
