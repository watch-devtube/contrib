title: 'LISA18 - SLO Burn—Reducing Alert Fatigue and Maintenance Cost in Systems of Any Size'

description: "Jamie Wilkinson, Google\n\nAbstract: \nBased on a true story.\n\nAs systems grow, they get more components, and more ways to fail. The alerts of the last system's design can slowly \"boil the frog\", and all of a sudden the SRE team finds they have no time left to address scaling problems because they're constantly firefighting. Alert fatigue sets in and the team will burn out.\n\nNaturally maintenance work will always increase as the system itself grows. To make alerting sustainable, instead of on cause, only page on symptom, and even then by declaring what the acceptable threshold of symptom is -- also known as the SLO (and it's complement, the error budget).\n\nEven at Google scale, many teams are yet to implement the change in their monitoring to realise SLO based alerts. But systems don't need to be the size of a planet to benefit from these patterns.\n\nWhether you're oncall for 10 machines or 10 datacenters, in this talk a well rested champion of work/life balance will show you how to select service objectives, then to construct robust and low maintenance alerting rules using Prometheus for a live demonstration. We'll also discuss the tooling required to help make such a system retain observability in the absence of noisy caused-based alerts, now they're not telling you exactly which components are failing.\n\nView the full LISA18 Program at https://www.usenix.org/lisa18/conference-program"
