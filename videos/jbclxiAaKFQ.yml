description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nApache Spark is one of the most popular Big Data tools in the Scala Community & Datasets are the next evolution of its popular API. Spark Datasets allow for a hybrid approach to programming, mixing both functional and relational concepts on the same data. This talk will introduce the basics of working with Spark Datasets, as well as look at how Spark's own different components (machine learning & streaming) are being rewritten to expose Dataset compatible APIs. No existing knowledge of Spark is required, but a basic understanding of Scala is assumed."
