description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015.\nData / Integration Track\nSpeaker: Dr. David Syer, Dr. Mark Pollack\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/message-driven-microservices-in-the-cloud\nAbstract:\nDo you need to build cloud-native microservices for distributed stream processing and data integration but don't know where to start? All you need is a single annotation in your code and a single dependency in your POM. The new Spring Cloud Stream project combines the power of Spring Boot, Spring Integration, and Spring Cloud to make that a reality.\n\nIn a nutshell, Spring Cloud Stream provides support for auto-configuration of Spring Integration capabilities, such as Channel Adapters for Kafka, RabbitMQ and Redis. The apps you build sit on a profile-driven foundation that ensures portability across runtime environments from your laptop to the cloud. Once you scale those distributed apps, you'll appreciate the integrated Spring Cloud features such as service discovery and configuration management.\n\nThis session will feature a series of live demos on different platforms ranging from local to a remote Cloud to show the simplicity of the Spring Cloud Stream developer experience. We will also dive into the details of what's happening behind the scenes. There will be stories about the background of how this project got started and its relevance for the evolution of Spring XD, as the latter has itself embarked on a cloud-native microservice journey."
