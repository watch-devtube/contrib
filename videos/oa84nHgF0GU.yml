description: "Episode 3: The Quest for Accelerated Delivery\n\nCarmen DeArdo, Director, Build Capability, Nationwide Insurance\nJim Grafmeyer, Systems Architect, Nationwide Insurance\nCindy Payne, Director, IT Architecture, Nationwide Insurance\n\nNationwide's journey began 8 years ago with an Agile at Scale implementation. This transformation created over 200 Agile teams which produced some demonstrable results. But our drive for Continuous Improvement created the realization that it was necessary to drive further changes in process, technology and culture across the entire Delivery Value Stream. Nationwide, like many other Fortune 100 companies, acknowledges that having a world class IT Delivery Capability is essential to remaining competitive in the next decade and beyond. This third DevOps Enterprise Summit installment focuses on the progress made to date and the journey that lies ahead on our continuing Quest to Accelerate Delivery.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
