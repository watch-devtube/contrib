description: 'Microsoft’s ASP.NET Core is a brand new web framework, completely open sourced and cross-platform; for building scalable- & cloud-ready web applications. This talk covers some of the features in the framework, that is not that obvious, in my opinion, that we can utilise when building modern and practical APIs. Think REST, dependency injection, application startup, startup filters, custom servers, clients, hosted services, conventions, model binding, application parts, HATEOAS, and more.'
