description: "? Support the show by becoming a Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/funfunfunction\n\nToday, I’m going to show examples of this and bind. In the last episode we explored this and bind. Reading the comments of the last video, it’s clear that some people had an aha moment around this, but for a lot of you it this didn’t click. It really, really important that we understand the concept of this in order to learn the object model in JavaScript, so I’m going to spend a video on doing a bunch of more examples, so that more people get it. \n\nThis video is part a series on object creation on JavaScript, that is for you if are coming from another programming language into JavaScript and you’re already somewhat familiar with object oriented programming. You know what classes and inheritance is, but you’re confused about how object orientation is done in JavaScript. You’ll get much more out of this video if you watch  this series from the the start - you can find a link the full series in the episode description. \n\nTable of contents:\n02:19 ?
