description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: Palo Alto Networks - Reimagining the MITRE ATT&CK Framework for Cloud Native Applications - Keith Mokris & Ashley Ward\n\nSharing of Personal Information with Sponsors In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event, you may choose to visit a third partyʼs virtual booth or to access sponsored content. You are never required to visit third party booths or to access sponsored content. When visiting a booth (e.g. by clicking on a third partyʼs logo in the Solutions Showcase or exhibitor directory, and any actions within the booth thereafter including viewing resources), when accessing sponsored sessions in the Sponsor Theater, or by participating in sponsored activities, the third party will receive some of your registration data. This data includes your first name, last name, title, company, address, email, standard demographics questions (i.e. job function, industry), and details about the sponsored content or resources you interacted with. If you choose to interact with a virtual booth or access sponsored content, you are explicitly consenting to receipt and use of such data by the third-party recipients, which will be subject to their own privacy policies.\n\nThis is an on-demand session and will be available for the duration of the event.\n\nToday, enterprises use a combination of virtual machines, containers and Kubernetes, and platform as a service (PaaS) offerings to power their cloud native applications. While customers love and trust MITRE ATT&CK® to measure the effectiveness of their security operations and identify areas of improvements, they are now looking to extend this framework to their portfolio of cloud native applications. In this 15-minute demo session, Prisma Cloud will unveil industry's first comprehensive cloud native threat matrix. Watch a Prisma® Cloud expert walk you through the new interactive dashboard that references the ATT&CK Framework™ to 12 distinct categories for audits and events."
