title: 'The many ways of invoking methods using Bytecode'
recordingDate: 1543661698
description: 'This will be a talk about how I develop bytecode for Groovy using asm. Since the area is much to big for a talk I will focus here on method invocation only. This talk will contain a lot of topics an ordinary java programmer probably has never had to do with before. We will be talking about why an invokespecial is so special, what the difference between invokestatic and invokevirtual is, what a operand stack is, how variable, line numbers and exceptions are represented and why the bytecode is full of GOTO instructions.'
