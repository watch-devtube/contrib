description: "In two parts, I’ll share the story of how I transformed into a hirable web developer in just under one year while highlighting the ways people helped me to get to that point. I hope you’ll come away with ideas how you can make a difference in your own community. As Tal Ben-Shahar says, there is no more selfish act than a generous one, so this talk is really for your own good.\n\nTranscript & slides: http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/michele-guido-it-takes-a-village-to-make-a-programmer.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
