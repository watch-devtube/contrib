description: "Android Studio has a ton of options that can help developers when debugging their applications. This talk aims to demonstrate how to make the most of these features to maximize developers’ debugging efficiency.\n\nThis talk will go through the options available for debugging applications on the IntelliJ platform in general, and the Android Studio IDE in particular. Code samples, shortcut keys, and various options and set ups will be shown throughout.\n\nZarah has been involved in mobile development work since 2007. She has been growing up with the Android platform since Donut and has helped produce beautiful, delightful apps both big and small. Her love for Android development brought her to Sydney in 2014.\n\nAs the Women Techmakers lead in Sydney, Zarah helps organise events for GDG Sydney and the Android User Group.\n\nFor more on YOW!
