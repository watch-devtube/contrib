description: "Visual Studio Code started off as a lightweight editor and allows developers to work with source code - and people love it for its super fast performance, its lightweight nature, and its super smart code understanding. All this is now available for Java and Spring Boot, too. Installing the right extensions into VSCode results in a powerful and yet lightweight code editing experience that comes close to the feature richness of existing Java IDEs. In this session, we will show how you can use Visual Studio Code to implement Spring Boot applications. We will show which extensions to use and how they can be used, including: direct and super fast Spring Initializr support, Maven integration, support for Git, smart Java code editing, running JUnit tests directly from within the editor, debugging Java applications, and using the all-new Spring Tools 4 for Visual Studio Code to get a quick overview of your Spring code, use super fast navigation for Spring elements, understanding your app using live information from running Spring applications directly in your editor, and more. Watching this session will give you a detailed overview of what is possible (and what is not yet) when using Visual Studio Code as your premier development environment for Spring Boot applications.\nSpeakers:\nRome Li\nSenior Software Engineering Manager, Microsoft\nMartin Lippert\nPrincipal Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
