description: "Multitenancy is a software architecture pattern in which a single instance of software serves multiple groups of users (known as tenants or organizations). Many modern SaaS applications use this pattern to serve their customers with maximum efficiency while maintaining operational costs low. But how do you build a multitenant application right? How do you secure one tenant's information from another tenant's users? How do you keep operational costs low? How do you monitor and manage this stuff?\n\nIn other words - how do you keep the neighbors happy??\n\nIn this session you will gain practical architecture tips and tricks for architecting multitenant SaaS applications, learnt from migrating real applications to the cloud so that you won't have to learn them the hard way, along with implementation tips and tricks on Microsoft Azure."
