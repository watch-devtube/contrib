title: 'Saulius Valatka - How we learned to love the Data Center Operating System'
recordingDate: 1469096652
description: "As packaging applications in containers is becoming more popular the idea of running a data center operating system is starting to make sense — developers produce containers and ship them off without worrying too much where they run.\nWhile this sounds perfect in theory, it obviously introduces new challenges in practice: how do you plan capacity, how do you discover your apps, what about persistence ?\n\nIn this talk we will share our experience of running applications in Docker containers on a shared Apache Mesos cluster, what challenges we faced and how we overcame them.\n\nDevOps Pro Vilnius 2016 - http://goo.gl/D9eDT7"
