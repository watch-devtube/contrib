recordingDate: 1297948176
description: "There are ten or twenty times more people interested in accessibility features than think of themselves as disabled and publishers have a tremendous opportunity to build a market model that will tap this sizeable market.\n\nThis keynote will cover the technology and rights issues publishers need to understand to build in accessibility from the inception of a project and discuss why \"heavy-handed\" technical protection measures are not helping.\n\nIt will help publishers understand how to comply with the pressure from Washington for full accessibility in educational materials and online products as well as what we anticipate will be defined by Washington at the end of the day.\n\nAs the book becomes increasingly a multi-media product, Fruchterman will discuss what the challenges are to building in accessibility and how requirements such as for accurate metadata need to be structured to fuse the very different metadata structures currently in place for books vs. video.\n\nJim Fruchterman\n\nBenetech\n\nA technology entrepreneur, Jim Fruchterman is a former rocket scientist who has founded two of the foremost optical character recognition companies and developed successful social enterprises. Jim co-founded Calera Recognition Systems in 1982. Calera developed character recognition that allowed computers to read virtually all printed text.\n\nIn 1989, Jim founded Arkenstone, a nonprofit social enterprise, to produce reading machines for the disabled community based on the Calera technology. Following the sale of the Arkenstone product line in 2000, Jim used all the resulting capital to fund Benetech, with an explicit goal of using the power of technology to serve humanity.\n\nJim has also been active in public service, with two stints on U.S. federal advisory committees. In 2006, he received a MacArthur Fellowship. Jim was named an Outstanding Social Entrepreneur in 2003 by the Schwab Foundation and continues to participate in the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Benetech received the Skoll Award for social entrepreneurship under Jim's leadership. Jim also received the Robert F. Bray Award from the American Council of the Blind in recognition of his outstanding efforts to make literary works accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.\n\nJim believes that technology is the ultimate leveler, allowing disadvantaged people to achieve more equality in society. \"I'm an advance scout for social applications,\" notes Jim. \"I find exciting technology waiting to be turned into non-commercial tools for disadvantaged groups.\""
