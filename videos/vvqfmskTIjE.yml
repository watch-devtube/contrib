recordingDate: 1495806478
description: "http://2017.jsconf.eu/speakers/nidin-vinayakan-shared-memory-parallel-programming-with-javascript.html\n\nEarly look in to the upcoming JavaScript features SharedArrayBuffer and Atomics. I will show you, how to craft complex applications using shared memory and gain massive performance boost by utilizing all available CPU cores for parallel computation on same data. I will also teach you how to write safe code while using shared memory and avoiding deadlocks of web workers. I will introduce a custom TypeScript like language called TurboScript for easy parallel programming which will generate efficient asm.js like JavaScript. Finally I will do a live demo of an app created using shared memory and TurboScript “A Global Illumination Ray Tracing Renderer for Three.js”"
