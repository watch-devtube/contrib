description: "While MicroServices Architecture focuses on decoupling and encourages rapid deployments allowing us to go fast, we still live in the world of slow deployments via Google Play and Apple's AppStore. So what's the good of it?\n\nValidating assumptions quickly or using canary deployments? – forget it. Even correcting small errors can take time. This drives most developers to use very extensive testing and manual QA to minimize the risks. This is a Waterfall thinking! This slow deployment cycle is what drives us to MicroServices approach on mobile platforms: small, decoupled MicroServices that are easy to test, independently deployable and isolated from one another. That's Agile and LEAN thinking.\n\nSample code, tutorials, and documentation of the various mobile platforms encourage building monolithic applications. We reject those as poor development practices. In this talk, we discuss the alternative architecture to create independent MicroServices on mobile platforms. Also, we will demonstrate the ease of which such a system can be changed. And we will take a deep look into the trade-offs and challenges of such approach."
