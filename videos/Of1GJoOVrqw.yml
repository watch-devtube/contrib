description: "The momentum for modern web technologies and JavaScript frameworks keeps growing. These frameworks allow for a fast and fluent, app-like, user experience on the web. On top of this we see the lines between web and app development blurring further. The web is getting features that were only available to apps before and developers are now also able to build quality apps at a fast pace based on web technologies.\n\nEVENT:\n\nDroidcon Berlin 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJake Wharton - Google\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed). \n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd-Xztr4fyY"
