description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLightning Talk: Connecting the (platform) pieces for automated CI/CD - Jan Willies, Accenture\n\nApplication Development Platforms have a long history in modern IT, trying to solve many challenges along the way. From connecting git-repositories (push to deploy) over describing build & test steps to creating environments for different purposes (CI/CD). In this session we want to explore how we can leverage the open source software crossplane with its provider and XRM features to connect different pieces which compose an application development platform. We will start with the basics and setup a git repository from within crossplane, connect a CI/CD system and automate feedback into the respective system. In the end we will have an API in which we can not only describe application dependencies like infrastructure but also git repositories and CI/CD systems."
