In fact, it's the conjunction of many streams of work in technology, education research, production, international politics and intense creativity.  \n\nIn this talk, Nadine Zylstra, VP Sesame Street Production and Programming and Supervising Producer of Sesame Street takes us under the hood. Through the lens of Sesame Street's recent STEM (Science-Technology-Education-Math) and STEAM (STEM + Arts) initiatives Nadine will break down the Sesame Street Production Model for inspection. \n\nHow do preschoolers learn? How does one create compelling preschool content that teaches complex educational goals? How can you use the digital eco-system to deepen impact? What will content innovation look like ten years from now?\n\nSpeaker Info:  Nadiene Zylstra, Vice President of Sesame Street Production, Sesame Workshop\n\nAs Vice President of Sesame Street Production Zylstra supervises the creative direction of the video content produced for both linear and digital platforms.\n\nZylstra joined the Sesame Street family as a director and producer on the South African version of Sesame Street.
