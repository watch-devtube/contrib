title: 'The reactive landscape by Clement Escoffier'
language: English
recordingDate: 1495025843
description: "Reactive Programming, Reactive eXtensions, Reactive Streams, Reactive Systems, Reactive Manifesto, that’s a lot of “reactive” thingies. Just to make it even more confusing, \"reactive\" is often associated with asynchronous, scalability, RX libraries, back pressure, streams, observables, futures, promises, spreadsheets and so on…. That's a lot to digest…\n\nThis session helps you understanding what's behind the \"reactive\" word. It explores the reactive landscape and explains what all these “things” are and how they are related.\n\nAttendees don't only learn what does \"reactive\" mean, but also how it is related to their projects and applications.  By providing a global overview of the reactive landscape, this session also provides to the attendees a general understanding of the \"reactive\" trend, and why it matters.\n\nThe presentation uses live coding to explain the different concepts. It uses Eclipse Vert.x as a playground to explain how all these concepts work together. Eclipse Vert.x is a toolkit to build reactive and distributed systems on the JVM. It covers a large part of the reactive spectrum making it a great choice to implement reactive applications and systems. \n\nClement Escoffier \nWho am I? That’s a good question. I had several professional lives, from academic positions to management. Currently, I’m working for Red Hat as Vert.x core developer. I have been involved in projects and products touching many domains and technologies such as OSGi, mobile app development, continuous delivery, DevOps… My main point of interest? Software engineering, so processes, methods, tools that make the development of software more efficient and also more fun. I’m also an active contributor to many open source projects such as Apache Felix, iPOJO, Wisdom Framework, and obviously, Eclipse Vert.x."
