description: "Beyond Buzzwords: Riding the Wave to Turn Trends into Profit - Duncan Winn, Keith Strini & Sean Keery, Pivotal\n\nWe the Cloud Foundry community have spent a considerable time understanding and unpacking buzzword terms like Agile, Devops, Microservices and Cloud Native. This presentation goes beyond simply unpacking trends and terminology. It will bring you tangible real world examples - from several industries - on how companies have embraced and adopted essential IT trends through leveraging Cloud Foundry to realise substantial increases in profits.\n\nAbout Sean Keery\nSean Keery (Pivotal) began hacking obscure video game systems at the age of 13. Sean then developed interpersonal skills while teaching snowboarding. Nowadays we've got Cloud Foundry, choreography, containers and plenty of io. Cluster deployments, IaaS independence and his studies for a Masters in Data Science keep Sean occupied. The daily commute is filled with podcasts and chipmunk bunny hops. Some family time, spicy food, a good book and wrecking the latest toys keep Sean busy at home. @zgrinch\n\nAbout Keith Strini\nKeith Strini is Federal Practice Lead and Cloud Foundry Advisory Solutions Architect at Pivotal, implementing Cloud Foundry solutions across a wide variety of customer environments both in the Federal and Commercial space. Keith recently presented \"Catch Me If You Can\" at the Cloud Foundry Summit - Frankfurt 2016 Conference and at IC DevCon \"Mission Driven Design\" and \"Mean Time Between Fielding\". He also served as a technology analyst for the US Department of Defense and Intelligence communities. He has helped architect, develop and field information systems across the Joint Services both CONUS and OCONUS (Korea, Japan, Europe, and the Middle East) and NATO.\n\nAbout Duncan Winn\nDuncan has been working on Cloud Foundry for Pivotal since Pivotal formed in 2013. Currently Duncan works in Pivotal's Platform Architecture Team to help companies install and configure hardened Cloud Foundry environments and related services so they get the most out of Cloud Foundry in an enterprise setting. Prior to moving to the US he was the EMEA Cloud Foundry developer advocate for Pivotal and ran Pivotal's Platform Architecture Team in London. He is actively involved in the Cloud Foundry community blogging, running meetups and writing books."
