description: 'Three years ago we started the development of our debut game ''Action Henk''. After a crazy rollercoaster ride, we now have a game out there on Steam and consoles. Now that the dust has settled a bit, we can take a look back at the vast amount of decisions made during the development. We will dive into both the awesome and awful choices we made on things such as tech, design, business and marketing.'
