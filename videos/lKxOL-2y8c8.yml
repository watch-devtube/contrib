The transition to full time programming took less than 5 months, and now, 3 years later, I'm happier with my career than I've ever been.\n\nIf you have always been interested in transitioning into a programming career, but don't know how, this talk is for you!\n\nIf you have thought maybe you want to code, but you're not sure if you can do it, this talk is for you!\n\nIn this talk, I will talk about how I transitioned from marketing into full time programming, and cover the following topics:\n\nHow do you know that programming is right for you?\nAre coding bootcamps really worth the money?\nWhat did you learn at a coding bootcamp?\_\nWhat are alternatives to coding bootcamps?\nHow do I get my first job as a developer?"
