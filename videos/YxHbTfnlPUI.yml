description: "Swift is advertised as a C++ replacement. In this talk, I discuss how true is this claim, how Swift is built to compete on the same field, what is the current status of Swift 4 performance and how it compares to other languages. You’ll learn about Swift Intermediate Language, about memory management details and what to do to get the best out of Swift to make it fast.\n\nMore information about awesome conference: https://devfest.gdg.lv"
