description: "Build beautiful, cross-platform Mac, Linux, and Windows applications as easily as any webpage — without cross-browser headaches. Developers have tried before to make desktop apps with simple web frames and imperative jQuery soup. Performance and stability suffered. Modern web tooling is drastically improving this experience. \n\nIn this talk Nylas application engineer Evan Morikawa will use his experience building a highly extensible desktop email client to show how Electron, React, Flux, Node, SQL, and modern CSS create a pixel-perfect, fast, native-feeling app.\n\nhttp://forwardjs.com/\nhttps://newcircle.com/"
