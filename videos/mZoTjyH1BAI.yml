title: 'Accessibility vs latest Web APIs. Can’t we just get along? - Mauricio Palma'
recordingDate: 1534495565
description: "Unfortunately, we still treat accessibility in the same way we deal with front-end development for older browsers, something to be done at the end. What if I tell you that we can use the latest Web APIs and still offer an inclusive and accessible experience.\nIn this talk, you'll learn how to combine Web APIs such as Speech Recognition and Geolocation, with performant Javascript techniques to create empathic user interfaces."
