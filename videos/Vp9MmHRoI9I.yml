This talk demonstrates how to reverse engineer standard sensor wireless protocols from weather stations, movement sensors and more to use for your own designs!” \n\nRead more: http://oredev.org/2015/sessions/hacking-your-home--reverse-engineering-wireless-transmissions \n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
