Twitter's PowerTrack is a product that provides Enterprise customers the ability to filter a full firehose of data in realtime to receive only the data that they are interested in. Customers can define rules for the Tweets they receive based on a wide variety of dimensions, such as user attributes, geo-location, and language.\n\nCome learn about the PowerTrack architecture that solves technical challenges such as:\n\nFiltering data at scale in realtime\nApplication and system layer redundancy to deal with failures\nApplying configuration changes to open streaming connections\nBackfilling data to ensure 100% fidelity\nManaging state of customer streams across data centers And more!\n\nLisa White\nTWITTER\n\nLisa is the tech lead of the team responsible for building streaming data products at Twitter, including the Powertrack Streaming API.
