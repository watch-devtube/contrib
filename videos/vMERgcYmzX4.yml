description: "Blockhead Service Broker - An Open Service Broker to Manage Blockchain Applications on Cloud Foundry - Nima Kaviani & Morgan Bauer, IBM\n\nThe winners of the 2018 CF Summit Boston Hackathon are back discussing the details of their winning hackathon project - the BlockHead broker. BlockHead is a dedicated service broker developed based on the Open Service Broker (OSB) API that allows for the creation and deployment of smart contracts through creation and binding of services in Cloud Foundry. Developing smart contracts is difficult. The numerous steps of having to spin up a dedicated node, creating an account, compiling the smart contract, deploying the contract, and then binding to the contract through the generated interface make it hard for the average developer to easily build and test their distributed blockchain apps (dApps). We will demonstrate how the use of the BlockHead broker significantly facilitates the process of deploying and binding to smart contracts and helps developers focus on developing their web applications. Through integration with PaaS platforms such as Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry, developers can benefit from all the great features of a PaaS platform, including scalability promises , resiliency, etc.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyj/blockhead-service-broker-an-open-service-broker-to-manage-blockchain-applications-on-cloud-foundry-nima-kaviani-morgan-bauer-ibm"
