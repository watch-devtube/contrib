recordingDate: 1392027253
description: "http://jdk.io/\n\nIn this talk, we will start with a simple multi-threaded server that is limited by the number of threads allowed on the system and transform the code to use the Java NIO non-blocking features to avoid constructing too many threads.  We will work through the example together in a live coding demonstration.  You will learn about Java concurrency, Executors, multi-threaded data structures, Java NIO, non-blocking operations."
