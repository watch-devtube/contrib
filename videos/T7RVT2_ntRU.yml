title: 'Asciidoctor: New, Noteworthy, and Beyond by Alex Soto'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510048484
description: "Asciidoctor continues to take technical documentation by storm, especially in the Java sector. From software projects like Spring, JUnit, Hiberate, and Elastic, to specifications like CDI and Bean Validation, to tech publishers like InfoQ, O’Reilly, and independents, you don’t have to look far to find AsciiDoc powering documentation. These abundant and diverse use cases have helped push Asciidoctor to new limits. So what’s new and where’s it headed?\n\nI’ll start by covering the core mission of Asciidoctor and what changes we’re trying to push for in documentation. Then, I’ll survey recent improvements that have been introduced into the language and core processor. I’ll then present some of the extensions, integrations, and tools that have been developed around core. I’ll talk about how the processor fits with other components, such as static site generators, and what other software tools and processes are still needed. Finally, I’ll discuss where we’re headed with the AsciiDoc language and ecosystem.\n\nIf you’re using the AsciiDoc writing format or are interested in learning more about it, this talk will give you lots of information to take back to your writing desk.\n\n# Alex Soto\nAlex is a software engineer at Red Hat.
