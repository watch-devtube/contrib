description: "“Scrum is a lightweight framework that provides the minimum boundaries where teams can self-organize to solve complex solutions through empiricism. This simple framework is very powerful but it is frequently source of misunderstandings and misapplications. It is important to understand what is and what is not Scrum as well as the core purpose of its elements. Things like: Three questions need to be answered during the Daily Scrum, each Sprint may be considered a project with no more than a one-month horizon, Scrum Master should resolve team’s conflicts, Product Owner needs to attend the Sprint Retrospective, The Development Team commits to the Sprint Backlog … Are they Scrum facts or not? In this interactive session we will discuss the facts or myths above and many more so that we can fix some frequent misapplications and amplify the benefits we can get from Scrum.”\n\nAbout the speaker:  Currently Leonardo is a Scrum Master consultant at Mastercard in Dublin, Ireland.
