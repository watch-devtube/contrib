description: "Java developers want to write code, and security testers want to break it. The problem is that security testers need to know more about code to do better testing and developers need to be able to quickly address problems found by testers. This presentation looks at both groups and their toolsets and explores ways they can help each other out. Using open source examples built on OWASP ZAP, ThreadFix, and Eclipse, it walks through the process of seeding web application scans with knowledge gleaned from code analysis as well as the mapping of dynamic scan results to specific lines of code in Java developers’ IDEs.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDan Cornell\nDan Cornell has over fifteen years of experience architecting and developing web-based software systems. As CTO of Denim Group, he leads the organization’s technology team overseeing methodology development and project execution for Denim Group’s customers. He also heads the Denim Group security research team, investigating the application of secure coding and development techniques to the improvement of web-based software development methodologies. \n\nDan Cornell has performed as the CTO of BrandDefense, as founder and Vice President of Engineering for Atension prior to its acquisition by Rare Medium, Inc. and as the Vice \nPresident, Global Competency Leader for Rare Medium’s Java and Unix Competency Center. Cornell has also developed simulation applications for the Air Force with Southwest \nResearch Institute. \n\nIn March 1999, Texas Monthly Magazine named Cornell and his partners, Sheridan Chambers and Tyson Weihs, to its list of 30  Multimedia Whizzes Under Thirty  doing business in \nTexas. He has published papers on topics ranging from data security to high-end graphical simulations, as well as an IBM Redbook on building server-side Java applications for the Linux platform. He has also been published by the Association of Computing Machinery, and the Society of Computing Simulation International. \n\nDan was the founding coordinator and chairman for the Java Users Group of San Antonio (JUGSA) and is currently the San Antonio Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) chapter leader.
