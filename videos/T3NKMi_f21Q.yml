description: "Joel Stanley\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/35/\nModern cars come complete with an in vehicle entertainment system, which is a car sales speak for embedded Linux computer with a touch screen.\r\n\r\nThese Linux machines are typical of the rising trend of the Internet of Things; poorly maintained, out of date, insecure and tied in to the critical functioning of your purchase.\r\n\r\nCome with me on an adventure through my car, as we pull apart the installed system, examine the security issues, extend the functionality, all the while trying really hard to not create a new-car priced brick."
