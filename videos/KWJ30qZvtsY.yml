title: 'Behind the AI Curtain - Designing for Trust in Machine Learning Products - Crystal C. Yan'
recordingDate: 1535379112
description: "When startups first launch, they can make the news with application of cutting edge AI - but convincing users to trust the AI is often another story. There's often also no process for integrating future AI development into product roadmaps.\nThis session covers three key principles for how design and data science teams can work together better to build greater trust among users. Additionally, a case study on how a design and data science team partnered to redesign predictive analytics scores powered by machine learning will illustrate those principles in practice."
