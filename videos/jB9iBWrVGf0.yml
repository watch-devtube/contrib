language: English
recordingDate: 1499176660
description: "Today, many projects are increasingly focused on web based applications using web browsers as their primary user interface. How durable is this application architecture? Is the browser likely to continue to expand its primacy? Can we expect the basic structure of our web based applications to remain fairly stable for the foreseeable future or do we need to be preparing to make drastic changes? If the browser is a transitional technology, what might replace it? This talk will explore these and related issues and help you understand how application development is about to change.\n\nAllen Wirfs-Brock is a Mozilla Research Fellow and currently spends most of his time working on enhancing the JavaScript programming language and shaping the future of the web application development. He is project editor for ECMAScript 5 and 5.1, the latest editions of the JavaScript standard. He was a pioneering implementer of object-oriented languages and, as a technical and entrepreneurial leader, helped drive the emergence of object-oriented programming as a mainstream technology.\n\nFor more on YOW!
