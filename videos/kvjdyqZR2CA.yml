description: "This workshop traverses the new features in Java EE 7 by introducing the Cargo Tracker application. This end-to-end example is a new project on java.net. Cargo Tracker brings back some of the ideas of the Java EE Blue Prints efforts of years past. Some of the new Java EE 7 features demonstrated in Cargo Tracker include JMS 2, WebSockets, JSON-P, JAX-RS 2, JSF 2.2, JPA 2.1 and Java Batch.\n\nThis is your chance to look at Java EE 7 features in the context of a realistic application, available with an MIT license at http://cargotracker.java.net."
