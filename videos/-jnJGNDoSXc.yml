title: 'Priyatam Mudivarti - Responsive Grid with Garden CLJS'
language: English
recordingDate: 1429654458
description: "Clojurescript community has been slow to embrace Garden, a simple library for rendering CSS in Clojure/ClojureScript. Conceptually similar to Hiccup, Garden allows you to design pages and layouts like a functional programmer: plain-old data structures, functions, and abstractions.\n\nIn this talk I will focus on responsive grid techniques popularized by Bootstrap, Susy, Flexbox, followed by a live-coding session. We will explore how to implement fluid, responsive, nested, and even DIY grids with Garden, and render CSS3 on the server or client. We will end with a demo of a page designed in Garden, rendered with Om, to showcase the benefits of using Clojurescript all the way."
