description: "The Collections Framework was introduced in JDK 1.2 back in 1998 and is still in heavy use today. Although its fundamentals remain unchanged, it has evolved considerably since its introduction and it continues to evolve. This presentation describes some of the recent enhancements made to Collections, particularly the lambda-capable default methods added in Java 8. It also covers enhancements currently in development for Java 9, including JEP 269, Convenience Factory Methods, a library-based API that serves the purpose of collection literals. Finally, the session provides a glimpse at some several possible futures for the Collections Framework.\n\nBlog: https://blogs.oracle.com/java/collections-refueled"
