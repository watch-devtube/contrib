description: "One of the key benefits of continuous integration servers is that they enable you to effectively utilize a large number of virtual computers as they are becoming cheaper and more abundant. Doing this is becoming increasingly important as expanding computing power clearly comes in the form of higher parallelism, not faster computers. This session first looks at the basics of setting up Jenkins for a large number of slaves and then examines various techniques enabled by them, such as load testing with many load-generating clients and parallel testing, and how to orchestrate those activities. The presentation highlights various plug-ins in Jenkins that are useful for meeting this goal and how they can be combined so that you can do the same with Jenkins.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJesse Glick\nJesse Glick works for CloudBees, where he is an active committer to the Jenkins project. His involvement includes all aspects of the core as well as a number of widely used plugins, with a current special focus on the Workflow feature. He also works on Jenkins Enterprise and Jenkins Operations Center, and on parts of the CloudBees hosted Jenkins service such as the VPN feature. Prior to that, he was a NetBeans IDE engineer at Sun/Oracle, involved in key components such as the project system. He has spoken several times at JavaOne.\nView more trainings by Jesse Glick at https://www.parleys.com/author/jesse-glick-1\n\nKohsuke Kawaguchi\nKohsuke is the creator of Jenkins and wrote the majority of the Hudson core single-handedly.
