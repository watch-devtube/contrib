title: 'Reactive web services - Kamil Szyma?ski'

description: 'Ahh, reactive, probably the buzzword of 2018, newer and shinier than good ol'' microservices, all asynchronous, non-blocking and I''ve even heard some event-driven buzz around it. During this live-coding session we won''t focus on the shiny nor on saving the world with dataflows using composable operators. Instead we''ll focus on how the execution of this reactive approach differs from ''classic imperative approaches'' and check how it impacts resource consumption. We''ll also see backpressure in action, cover the topic of data serialization and talk about event loops.'
