recordingDate: 1484832304
description: "Eion Robb\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/87/\nSending pictures of our feline overlords is an important part of the social internet. Unfortunately, large companies want to make this harder by keeping us out of their networks unless our cats fit their ideals. To make a better future for ourselves (and our cats), we need to be empowered so we are able to take arms and fight back. This talk aims to share the knowledge, history, legalities and tools at our disposal to reverse engineer IM protocols and, most importantly, send cat pics."
