description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWhy the future of the cloud will be built on Rust - Oliver Gould, Buoyant\n\nFor consideration as a keynote. In this presentation, Oliver Gould, creator of Linkerd---the first CNCF project to incorporate Rust, and a major driver of the early Rust networking ecosystem---will present an argument that the future of cloud software and the cloud native ecosystem will be tied to the Rust programming language. Oliver will argue that, while Go is the lingua franca of the *current* cloud native ecosystem, Rust will be the lingua franca--or at least one lingua franca---of the *future* ecosystem. He will draw parallels between the constraints of cloud environments, the core principles of the cloud native ecosystem, and the principles of Rust itself, grounded in concrete examples from Linkerd's Rust proxy as well as other projects. Finally, he will present a roadmap for the future of Rust in the cloud native world, both as captured by the CNCF ecosystem and beyond."
