description: 'Being a newer technology, Docker has yet to make its way into some computer science training programs. College programs, bootcamps, and online resources have yet to jump onto the container train; so, what''s the best way for newer engineers to learn Docker from square one? Chloe (former actress turned developer) tells her story about how she went from wondering "What''s a Docker?" to helping teach others about Docker and instead asking "What?? You haven''t heard of Docker?". This talk is perfect for anyone new to Docker looking for how to get started, or for those interested in learning how to teach Docker to new users.'
