recordingDate: 1530786882
description: "While development teams are delivering software ever faster, security is often left behind as many security teams are stuck in a world of monolithic software that is not connected to anything. The most important factor in delivering interconnected high-value software to your customers without sacrificing speed is building security into the core of your development process. Stefan Vogl takes the audience on an ever-ongoing journey to develop high-velocity secure software.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
