description: "Olivier Etienne (Orange)\n\nThis talk will explain what a TV App context is and the kind of problems we can encounter when trying to automate the things out. Olivier will go through previous failures, their approach and what have been the key points to build an automatic test tool. If time permits, he will go deeper in the details of the implementation.\n\nCome listen how a few solders and some lines of code have opened the rich world of web testing to a set-top box."
