recordingDate: 1331852985
description: "A lot of startups choose to defer the \"pricing question\" because they don't think their product is ready. The common mindset when launching a new product is one of lowering sign-up friction through discounting or making the product free. This not only delays validation of one of the riskier parts of your product, but a lack of strong customer \"commitment\" can also be detrimental to optimal learning.\n\nIn this webcast you will learn:\n\n-How to set initial pricing for your product\n-How to test and refine that price with your customers\n-Bonus: When and how to use Freemium\n\nThis is the second in a three-part webcast series called The Lean Series. In this event, we'll look at how to test one of the trickier aspects of a product - pricing.\n\nAbout Ash Maurya:\n\nAsh Maurya (@ashmaurya) is the founder of USERcycle.
