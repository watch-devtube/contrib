title: 'YOW! Connected 2015 Sam Ritchie - Untangling Callback-Spaghetti with ReactiveCocoa'
language: English
recordingDate: 1462090491
description: "TL;DR - If you have callbacks manipulating object state, you have bugs.\n\nMost modern mobile apps are event driven - location, touch events, network calls, push notifications etc can all trigger app behaviour. Traditional imperative approaches to managing these events are difficult to understand/maintain and are a reliable source of semantic bugs in your app.\n\nReactiveCocoa is an open source Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) implementation for iOS, and offers a better approach to implementing event-driven code. This presentation will show how to use the new ReactiveCocoa 3 to build better Swift apps.\n\nSam has an extensive background leading small, focused teams building in-house business systems in .NET, and has concentrated on cloud & mobile solutions for the last five years. He’s been an Apple fanboy since the 80s, was coding in Objective-C before it was cool, and Swift was his favourite language before he’d written a single line.\n\nIn his spare time he likes to start projects he’s never going to finish, most of them involving one or more of iOS, CouchDB, LevelDB, F#, Haskell, and Arduino.\n\nFor more on YOW!
