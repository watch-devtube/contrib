title: '"The Zen of High Performance Messaging with NATS" by Waldemar Quevedo Salinas'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474222797
description: "NATS is an open source, high performant messaging system with a design oriented towards both being as simple and reliable as possible without at the same time trading off scalability. Originally written in Ruby, and then rewritten in Go, a NATS server can nowadays push over 11M messages per second.\n\nIn this talk, we will cover how following simplicity as the main design constraint as well as focusing on a limited built-in feature set, resulted in a system which is easy to operate and reason about, making up for an attractive choice for when building many types of distributed systems where low latency and high availability are very important."
