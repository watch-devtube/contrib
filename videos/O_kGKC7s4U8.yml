description: "There have been a lot of ideas and a lot of speculation about the future of CSS in the last year or so. Will we write styling code purely in JS? Will CSS still have a place, and if so, what will it look like? And how long will we have to wait before we can take the next step?\nI'll be talking about two projects I've been heavily involved in — Interoperable CSS and CSS Modules. I'll show how they are fundamentally changing what CSS is capable of, drastically simplifying the areas that cause the most headaches. And, taking a lesson from the JS world and CSS preprocessors like Sass, why we don't have to wait for the browsers to catch up.\n\nGlen is an independent front-end consultant from Melbourne, Australia. He's an organiser of CSS Conf AU, a co-creator of the CSS Modules standard, contributor to the JSPM ecosystem, and all-round builder of rad web things. But his true calling is to become the world's greatest GIF DJ (any day now...)\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore - 18 November 2015.\n\nSource: http://2015.cssconf.asia\nSlides: http://glenmaddern.com/slides/modular-style\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
