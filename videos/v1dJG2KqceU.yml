description: "Google invited me to attend their annual developer conference called Google I/O in Mountain View California. I went ahead and vlogged the experience using a GoPro camera that they sent me. In this video, you'll see my journey to IO including the car ride, meeting developers, some really cool machine learning demos, and the concert afterwards. I am posting this since only because i got a few requests for it. It was a fun experience and I encourage people to go if they get the opportunity. \n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
