description: "??ATTENTION ??\nRegistration to ?DevTernity 2018 is running:\n? https://devternity.com\n\nMongoDB 3.0 introduces a pluggable storage architecture and a new storage engine called WiredTiger. The engineering team behind WiredTiger team has a long and distinguished career, having architected and built Berkeley DB, now the world’s most widely used embedded database. In this session, we’ll describe the original design goals for WiredTiger, including considerations we made for heavily threaded hardware, large on-chip caches, and SSD storage. We’ll also look at some of the latch-free and non-blocking algorithms we’ve implemented, as well as other techniques that improve scaling, overall throughput and latency. Finally, we’ll take a look at some of the features we hope to incorporate into WiredTiger and MongoDB in the future. A full description of the Architecture that supports MongoDB, from the very low Storage Engine to the more abstract Drivers and Aggregation Framework"
