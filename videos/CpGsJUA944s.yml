title: 'Exploiting Modern Microarchitectures: Meltdown, Spectre, and Other Hardware ATTACKS'
language: English
recordingDate: 1523982601
description: "Recently disclosed vulnerabilities against modern high performance computer microarchitectures known as 'Meltdown' and 'Spectre' are among an emerging wave of hardware focused attacks. These include cache side channel exploits against underlying shared resources, which arise as a result of common industry-wide performance optimizations. More broadly, attacks against hardware are entering a new phase of sophistication that will see more in the months ahead. This talk will describe several of these attacks, how they can be mitigated, and generally what we can do as an industry to bring performance without trading security.\n\nEVENT:\n\nFOSDEM 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJon Masters\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kCDPCgjlJ4"
