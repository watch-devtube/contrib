title: 'Ethereum and React: An Introduction to Building Your First Web dApp'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526238007
description: "Ethereum, a blockchain based technology, empowers you to write decentralized applications (dApps) utilizing smart contracts and the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Sound scary? It’s not.\n\nDid you know that that you can create web-based applications on top of Ethereum? That its language, Solidity, shares similarities to JavaScript? That tools exist to leverage popular front-end frameworks like React?\n\nThis session will serve as an introduction to dApp development with the goal of setting a baseline to understand the core concepts and tools you need to start hacking away at the bleeding edge. Some of the topics we’ll cover include: understanding Ethereum and smart contracts, setting up a local blockchain testnet environment, the Truffle framework, Metamask plugin, the Solidity language and building React components to execute contracts that interact with the blockchain.\n\nEVENT:\n\nDrupalCon Nashville 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRyan Hagerty\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c3PT9NuFJ8&t=254s"
