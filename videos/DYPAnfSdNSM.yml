description: "From Traditional Database to Big Data Platform\n\nhttp://strataconf.com/stratany2012/public/schedule/detail/27514\n\nYou need more than a database 'hammer' for today's Big Data projects. Organizations need a 'data platform' providing integrated tools to capture, store, process and present data. Without it companies can achieve -- volume, velocity, or variety -- but not all three. Join us to learn the extreme capabilities needed to distill new business signals from big data.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by SAP"
