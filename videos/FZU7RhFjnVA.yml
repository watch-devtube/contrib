SDN is a radical change in the way networking is approached today. SDN brings the whole software development eco system close the network forwarding elements like switches and router. SDN enables the operators to integrate all the network resources and aspect into the application domain. The network virtualization will follow the computer virtualization.\n\nBy defining a vendor agnostic API (OpenFlow) to program the behavior of a whole network or network segment. This specification enables the software industry to quickly deliver new architectures, standards, functionalities and applications running on top of every OpenFlow enabled network.\n\nFlowER is an open-source Erlang based OpenFlow controller. Its purpose is to provide a simplified platform for writing network control software in Erlang. While still under heavy development, FlowER is the basis for Travelping next generation products and already in use in selected projects.\nThis talk will give an introduction to SDN, OpenFlow and how Erlang and FlowER can help you to get some spring fever in to your network.\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory  https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory \nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory  http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
