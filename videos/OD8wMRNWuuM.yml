Like sunlight or wind, this energy is free for the taking and is renewable. Question is, how do you harness it? And how much does it cost to install?\r\n \r\nChris Bruer, Creative Services Manager at GeoSmart Energy, will be talking about these relatively simple systems and how they are cost effective, energy efficient and environmentally friendly. He will explain how they work and give examples of how they can save money over time as well as other benefits of the systems.\r\n \r\nGeoSmart Energy is a Canadian company, based in Cambridge, that distributes Geothermal systems through a network of 300+ dealers across Canada and the United States."
