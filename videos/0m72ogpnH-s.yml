description: "by Xavier Delaruelle\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2215/environment_modules.webm\n\n\nTypically users initialize their shell environment when they log in a system by setting environment information for every application they will reference during the session. The Modules project, also referred as Environment Modules, provides a shell command named module that simplifies shell initialization and lets users dynamically and atomically modify their environment during the session with configuration files called modulefiles. \n\nThis talk will explain the root concept behind the module command then describe how it could be useful whether as a system administrator you have to provide access to a large software catalog or as an end-user you need to juggle with different workloads combining software elements. Current development trends to further improve the modulefile standard and the module command capabilities will then be shared with the audience. \n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:20:00+01"
