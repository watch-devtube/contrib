recordingDate: 1450725360
description: "Kris Buytaert, CTO, Inuits.eu\n\nEvelijn Van Leeuwen, Manager Management & Support Service, ING\n\nLots of people still think about DevOps in small organisations, agile speedboats, not about a big containership, like a bank. But these large containerships can also turn around. This talk will document an almost 4 year journey of a large financial institution. From organising internal devopsdays, building CI/CI pipelines, choosing the wrong tool, starting with the wrong teams first, ignoring the growing frustration from the ops people as the developers were pushing forward harder and harder, up to how to create focus inside the operations organisation and finally move towards infrastructure as code and better automated monitoring and metrics. How we turned the most grumpy engineer into one of the biggest evangelists. And much more."
