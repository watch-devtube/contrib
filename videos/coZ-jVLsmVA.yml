description: "The Chronicles of Web Standard: the HTML 5, the Comet and the WebSocket will be an exciting event coving Comet, HTML 5, the latest, and future enhancements to the web. AJAX became popular because it allows a browser to request additional information from the server. One major limitation of AJAX is that the browser must initiate the request for data from the server. Comet solves this problem by allowing the server to push data to the browser at any time. This event will start with a general introduction to Comet, followed by an in depth panel discussion moderated by Kevin Nilson with panelists:\r\nAlex Rusell, President of the Dojo Foundation & Project Lead for The Dojo Toolkit\r\nDion Almaer, co-founder of Ajaxian.com and \"Audible Ajax\" podcast\r\nMichale Carter, Founder at Orbited Project & Official Contributor for W3C HTML5\r\nJohn Fallows, CTO and co-founder at Kaazing\r\nTed Goddard,Senior Software Architect at ICEsoft Technologies and ICEfaces.org"
