description: "To get the most out of the hardware at our disposal today takes a deep understanding of the entire software and hardware stack. At no place is this more evident than the current CPU architectures. However, great gains are ripe for the taking when dealing with networks and the TCP/IP stack. In this talk, we will discuss some techniques that may be well known or unknown about how to get the most out of the TCP/IP stack of any modern OS. We'll discuss:\n\n(1) how application level batching can be leveraged to remarkably avoid common TCP pitfalls,\n\n(2) how the impact of UDP datagram size influences CPU and network efficiency,\n\n(3) why the new OS system calls like sendmmsg/recvmmsg are so hot, and\n\n(4) how easy it is to leverage asynchronous calls for fun and profit.\n\nTodd Montgomery is a networking hacker who has researched, designed, and built numerous protocols, messaging-oriented middleware systems, and real-time data systems, done research for NASA, contributed to the IETF and IEEE, and co-founded two startups. He currently works as an independent consultant on high performance systems and is active in several open source projects, including Agrona, Aeron, ReactiveSocket, and the FIX Simple Binary Encoding (SBE).\n\nFor more on YOW!
