description: "We're going to learn about all the details of style transfer (especially the math) using just Tensorflow. The goal of this session is for you to understand the details behind how style+content loss is calculated and minimized. We'll also talk about future discoveries.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/How_to_do_style_transfer_in_tensorflow\n\nLearning resources:\nhttp://www.makeuseof.com/tag/create-neural-paintings-deepstyle-ubuntu/\nhttps://blog.paperspace.com/art-with-neural-networks/\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/how_tos/\nhttps://no2147483647.wordpress.com/2015/12/21/deep-learning-for-hackers-with-mxnet-2/\nhttps://code.facebook.com/posts/196146247499076/delivering-real-time-ai-in-the-palm-of-your-hand/\nhttp://kawahara.ca/deep-dreams-and-a-neural-algorithm-of-artistic-style-slides-and-explanations/\nhttp://www.chioka.in/tensorflow-implementation-neural-algorithm-of-artistic-style\n\nPlease subscribe!
