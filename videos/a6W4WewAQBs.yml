title: 'Bringing beacons to the Windows platform - Michał Łusiak'
recordingDate: 1466069243
description: "Beacons are small Bluetooth LE devices that can bring physical context to your mobile apps. They were first embraced by the iOS ecosystem when Apple introduced iBeacons a few years ago. Last year Google announced project Eddystone that uses a similar concept, but expands it by adding a few features on top of that and by making it more open. It seems like Windows is running a bit behind in this area, and until recently there were no APIs in Windows stack to access beacons - but this has changed.\nThis talk will be a crash course in beacon technology and interesting applications for them before we move on to technical part: how to write code that interacts with beacons on the Windows platform. If you are a Windows mobile developer and are interested in adding physical context to your applications - or just interested in beacons as a technology in general - then this talk is for you!"
