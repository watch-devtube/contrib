description: 'We all, for the most part, invest time in learning new front-end technologies but how much time if any do we put into client-side testing? We make excuses that JavaScript isn’t testable or integration tests are too much of hassle. The same reward you get for keeping up with front-end trends can be seen from writing code that’s designed to be tested. Practice makes perfect and the same goes for writing meaningful tests that will provide great returns for your application that grows over time with contributors and engineers. So come learn how you can start decoupling your code to make it testable.'
