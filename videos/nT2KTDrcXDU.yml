description: "by Adam Farley\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1302/java_docker.webm\n\n\nEver tried developing Java applications in containers? \n\nOf course not. You're a sensible person. \n\nFrom a small footprint to a super-fast spin-up time, the reality of  containers is a far cry from the reality of an OpenJDK binary execution. \n\nSo how do we bring these two disparate visions closer together? \n\nSimple! We jlink the required JDK modules to generate a smaller footprint,  then leverage alternate JVMs for performant startup! \n\nI promise, the reality is simpler than that sentence. :) \n\nDrop by and see what I mean. \n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 12:50:00+01"
