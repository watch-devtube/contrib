description: "This is a video of Fabrice Nourisson's and Dominic Williams' talk at London Erlang Factory Lite http://www.erlang-factory.com/\n\nErlang is a simple language specially designed for robust, high availability (HA) systems. In six years of working on telco systems, we have learned the hard way that there are a few pitfalls. We present the most common problems and the coding guidelines and design idioms we have adopted to deal with issues such as the atom table, memory and the garbage collector, message queues, flow control, configuration and hot code upgrades.\n\nTalk objectives: Warn developers of HA Erlang systems about common pitfalls and lessons learned, and provide coding guidelines and design idioms to avoid them.\n\nTarget audience: Developers and architects, aspiring Erlang experts, especially of high availability systems."
