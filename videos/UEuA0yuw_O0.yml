description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nEver wanted to modify some value or execute some statement while your C++ program is running just to test something out - not trivial or possible with a debugger? Scripting languages have a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop). The closest thing C++ has is cling (developed by researchers at CERN) but it is built on top of LLVM and is very cumbersome to set up and integrate.\n\nIn this presentation we will go through the inner-workings of a project showcasing an innovative approach to doing runtime C++ compilation in a platform and compiler agnostic way which can be easily embedded. We will see how to use it, how it works and how to modify and integrate it into any application and workflow.\n\nWARNING: 2 live demos !!!\n— \nViktor Kirilov\nBulgaria\n\nWith 4 years of professional experience with C++ in the games and VFX industries, Viktor currently spends his time writing open source software (since 01.01.2016). He is the author of doctest - \"The fastest feature-rich C++11 single-header testing framework\".\n\nHis interests are the making of games and game engines, high performance code, data oriented design, blockchains, optimizing workflows and incorporating good practices in the software development process such as testing and the use of modern tools like static analysis or instrumentation. \n\nViktor is from Sofia, Bulgaria and his profession is his hobby.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
