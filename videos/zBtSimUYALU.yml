language: English
recordingDate: 1492679005
description: "Ceylon is a new programming language with a unique and uncommonly elegant static type system, a powerful module architecture, a flexible but very readable syntax, and excellent tooling, including IDEs based on Eclipse and IntelliJ.\n\nIn this talk, Gavin King will show how to develop Android apps using Ceylon and Android Studio, and demonstrate some unique characteristics of the language.\n\nGavin King leads the Ceylon project at Red Hat. Gavin is the creator of Hibernate, a popular object/relational persistence solution for Java, and the Seam Framework, an application framework for enterprise Java. He's contributed to the Java Community Process as JBoss and then Red Hat representative for the EJB and JPA specifications and as lead of the CDI specification.\n\nGavin now works full time on Ceylon, polishing the language specification, developing the compiler frontend, and contributing to the IDEs."
