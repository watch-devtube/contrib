recordingDate: 1537814403
description: "Holden is a transgender Canadian open source developer advocate @ Google with a focus on Apache Spark, BEAM, and related \"big data\" tools. Bryan Cutler is a software engineer at IBM's Spark Technology Center, where he works on big data analytics and machine learning systems. \n\nPySpark is getting awesomer in Spark 2.3 with vectorized UDFs, and there is even more wonderful things on the horizon (and currently available as WIP packages). This talk will start by illustrating how to use PySpark’s new vectorized UDFs to make ML pipeline stages. Since most of us use Python in part because of its wonderful libraries, like pandas, numpy, and antigravity*, it’s important to be able to make sure that our dependencies are available on our cluster. Historically there’s been a few If there is time near the end we will talk about how to expose your Python code to Scala so everyone can use your fancy deep learning code (if you want them to). *Ok maybe not a real thing, but insert super specialized domain specific library you use instead 🙂\n\nTo learn more: https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/dataframes-datasets/introduction-to-dataframes-python.html"
