description: "The Making of a Mosquito.JS by Tim Holman\n\nThe audio api’s are one of the most complex and wonderful parts of the browser, built to open up the entire web to audio creation. At some point though, we were so preoccupied with whether or not we could, we didn’t stop to think if we should… And as such, mosquito.js was born.\n\nThis talk is about my descent into madness, as piece by piece I poured my energy into best possible recreation of the most dangerous, and annoying creatures on the entire planet. Learn some web audio basics, and some neat tips and tricks, and see how one person completely fell apart trying to perfect something that should never have existed in the first place. If you’re lucky, you can go a little insane too!\n\nTim is an Australian developer with a love for all things weird on the web, if you don’t catch him hacking away at the worlds most useless code, he’ll be working hard on tools to get more people into generative art, and feeling empowered to create!"
