description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nValue semantics has been promoted in the C++ community for a long time, for reasons such as referential transparency, avoidance of memory management issues, and even efficiency in some cases. Move semantics in C++11 was a big step in language-level support for value semantics. In this talk, we’ll cover steps taken in C++17 for enhanced library-support for value semantics. Specifically, we’ll focus on `std::optional`, `std::variant`, and `std::any`. \n\nWe’ll discuss what they are, their motivating use cases, and most importantly, identify existing patterns that can be improved by replacing it with one of these utilities. We’ll also cover some of the details such as: `std::monostate`, `std::variant`’s `valueless_by_exception` state, subtle difference in behavior between `std::optional?T?` and `std::variant?std::monostate, T?`, etc. \n\nThe goal of the talk is to inform you of new library features in C++17, and to convince you of their usefulness and ultimately to add them to your toolbox.\n— \nMichael Park: Mesosphere, Software Engineer\n\nI’m a committer for the Apache Mesos project, and work as a Distributed Systems Engineer at Mesosphere. Within the realm of computer science, I’m very much intrigued by language design, compiler construction, and distributed systems. I’m also an active member of the ISO C++ Standards Committee.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
