recordingDate: 1406493105
description: "Serialization is used anywhere in modern IT infrastructure. Saving information to the binary format files or database, sending data through network environment, client/server communication in Internet. These all are examples of explicit or implicit data persistence and serialization.\n\nDuring past years Java industry has released a lot of new frameworks, libraries and custom data formats to support and improve serialization for Java community. We will review the most popular frameworks, talk about usage and differences and analyze the performance testing. This seminar will be useful for everyone who wants to receive new knowledge or apply new persistence techniques in his project."
