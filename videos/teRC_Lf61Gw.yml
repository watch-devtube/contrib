title: 'Lambda Jam 2015 - Conal Elliott - A More Elegant Specification for FRP'
language: English
recordingDate: 1445133954
description: "This talk serves as a bridge between my keynote talk on Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and the workshop on Denotational Design. I show how to replace most of FRP’s original denotation (semantic specification) by saying that the meaning function distributes over the abstract interfaces, made precise as simple (and possibly familiar) equations. The resulting denotation is exactly equivalent to FRP’s original, less systematically defined, specification, but didn’t have to be invented specifically for FRP. I call this pattern “denotational design with type class morphisms” and have found it to be applicable to many other library designs as well, some of which appear in the longer workshop. Following this pattern provides simple, precise, and compelling “specifications for free”, while guaranteeing that the usual algebraic laws hold and preventing abstraction leaks.\n\nConal Elliott has been working (and playing) in functional programming for more than 30 years. He especially enjoys applying semantic elegance and rigor to library design and optimized implementation. He invented the paradigm now known as “functional reactive programming” in the early 1990s, and then pioneered compilation techniques for high-performance, high-level embedded domain-specific languages, with applications including 2D and 3D computer graphics. The latter work included the first compilation of Haskell programs to GPU code, while maintaining precise and simple semantics and powerful composability, as well a high degree of optimization. Conal earned a BA in math with honors from the College of Creative Studies at UC Santa Barbara in 1982 and a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1990. His latest position was at Tabula Inc, where he worked on chip specification and compiling Haskell to hardware for massively parallel execution until their closure in early 2015. Before Tabula, his positions included Architect at Sun Microsystems and Researcher in the Microsoft Research graphics group. He has also coached couples and led conscious relationship workshops together with his partner Holly Croydon, with whom he now lives on 20 acres in the woods in the California Gold Country.\n\nFor more on Lambda Jam, visit http://www.lambdajam.com"
