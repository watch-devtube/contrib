description: "Simple Abstractions for the Challenge of Complexity - How Cloud Foundry's Layered Approach Allows for Isolated Components and a Pattern for Reuse - Duncan Winn, Pivotal\n\nSimple abstractions for the challenge of complexity - how Cloud Foundry's layered approach allows for isolated components and a pattern for reuse.”\n\nWith all the hype around trends such as microservices, DevOps, and continuous delivery, what does it look like in reality? Cloud Foundry, including both the way it is architected, and developed, expertly demonstrate how these trends are established and why they make sense for distributed architectures such as Cloud Foundry.\n\nThis talk comes from spending three years writing a technical book on Cloud Foundry that explores the core components, the beauty of Diego’s abstraction , the value and progression of BOSH and the essential steps required for debugging CF.\n\nThis talk is intended for anyone getting started with CF or anyone who wants to see real world examples of the aforementioned trends in practice.\n\nAbout Duncan Winn\nDuncan has been working on Cloud Foundry since 2012. Currently Duncan works in Pivotal's Services Team to help companies install and configure hardened Cloud Foundry environments and related services so they get the most out of Cloud Foundry in an enterprise setting. Prior to moving to the US he was the EMEA developer advocate for Pivotal and ran Pivotal's Platform team in London."
