description: "My First BOSH Release - Rebecca Putinski & Peter Tran, Pivotal\n\nBOSH is a tool that unifies release engineering, deployment, and lifecycle management of small and large-scale cloud software by enabling operators deploy software over hundreds of VMs. But how do you get started with packaging your product so it can be deployed, versioned, and managed by BOSH? With BOSH releases, of course! A BOSH release is a versioned collection of configuration properties and templates, start-up scripts, source code, binary artifacts, and everything else required to build and deploy software in a reproducible way. In this talk, we will take you through the process of bringing a new BOSH release to life. We will demonstrate how to create a new release with dependencies and source code, and you’ll learn about the lifecycle hooks BOSH provides for release authors.\n\nAbout Peter Tran\nPeter is a senior software engineer at Pivotal Cloud Foundry. For the last two years, he worked on packaging data services like Greenplum and GemFire for Cloud Foundry app developers and is currently a core contributor to GemFire. He has extensive experience building usable BOSH releases containing complex software, release engineering, and continuous delivery. As part of the Pivotal Cloud Cache engineering leadership team, Peter helped deliver a cloud-native GemFire distribution that was more reliable and safer, quicker and easier to upgrade. Application teams are able to stay up to date with GemFire quarterly which was unheard of before Pivotal Cloud Cache\n\nAbout Rebecca Putinski\nRebecca works at Pivotal Cloud Foundry on the BOSH Core team in Toronto. She has been working in the Pivotal Cloud Foundry and open source Cloud Foundry ecosystem for several years, and has extensive experience with packaging distributed databases into BOSH releases.
