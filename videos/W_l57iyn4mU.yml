title: 'Programming with Actors (part 1)'
recordingDate: 1431329467
description: 'Actor based concurrency was popularized by languages like Erlang and Scala. This model of programming provides isolated mutability (as opposed to shared mutability) and easy way to implement coordinating processes or tasks. Actors can be local to a JVM, or distributed across VMs and machines. In this presentation we will learn how to use Akka Actors to design and implement distributed concurrent Java applications.'
