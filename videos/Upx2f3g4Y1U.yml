title: 'High Volume Automated Testing (HiVAT) - Baldvin Gislason Bern'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449761656
description: "Faced with new features, the amount of possible tests is usually enormous and attempting complete test coverage is often impractical if not impossible. Exploring user scenarios is one useful way of approaching this problem. This can be enhanced significantly by generating a large amount of combinations, run them automatically and flag for problems so a human can take a closer look. Baldvin Gislason Bern will describe how we have used this approach at Axis.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
