Realising at 30 that she no longer had interest in staying in the fashion industry, she decided to start pursuing her interest in tech instead. Armed with only a basic understanding of HTML/CSS, she found out about TechLadies’ bootcamp programme and decided to submit an application. She graduated from the 10-week bootcamp in December 2016, and has since transitioned to a full-time software engineer with a local startup.\r\n\r\nSu Yuen is the CEO & Co-founder of MomoCentral.com - an on-demand tech talent platform of designers and developers. All developers and designers go through a rigorous evaluation and testing process before being accepted into MomoCentral. The platform currently serves over 230 companies worldwide ranging from bootstrapped, YCombinator to Series C funded startups and MNCs.\r\n\r\nGa Young Jang grew up with Disney animations and dreamt of new adventures. She studied programming in order to work for at animation studios but she found her talent in technical pre-sales role and was hired by Microsoft as an intern. After 7 years of experience in Microsoft Korea, she moved to Singapore to start a new journey in Facebook, helping enterprises stay connected and turning business ideas into reality with familiar tools.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/techladies-bootcamp-3-info-session-registration-34200131514?aff=fbpage#\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/7IbP/"
