title: 'JDK IO 2018 - Oleg Šelajev - Run code in any language anywhere with GraalVM'

description: "Video recording of a presentation given at JDK IO conference in Copenhagen in June 2018 at the IT-University organized by the Danish Java User Group - Javagruppen.\n\nhttps://jdk.io/jdk-io-2018/speakers/225-oleg-selajev\n\nRun code in any language anywhere with GraalVM\n\nSpeaker: Oleg Šelajev\n\nGraalVM is an embeddable virtual machine designed for running all languages efficiently: Java, Scala, Kotlin, JavaScript, Ruby, or Python; and even the static one too, like C, C++ or Swift.\n\nIt uses the existing JVM architecture coupled with a state-of-the-art compiler to ensure better peak performance for long-running applications, but it can also run programs compiled ahead-of-time using a standalone native virtual machine to provide better startup time and lower runtime overhead essential for cloud applications and a true serverless experience.\n\nGraalVM's modular design allows embedding it in existing technologies, to create secure execution sandboxes for polyglot applications and resource virtualization platforms. This way you can write polyglot applications inside your Java applications or, for example, Oracle RDBMS or MySQL databases with zero overhead for accessing the data structures of the underlying engine.\n\nAll in all, using GraalVM makes developers more productive as they can use the programming language of their choice throughout the technology stack and reuse libraries from other ecosystems with ease.\n\nFrom this session, you'll learn key advantages and use cases of GraalVM for Java and JavaScript developers."
