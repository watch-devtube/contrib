title: 'Aaron Powell   Type safe GraphQL with TypeScript'
language: English
recordingDate: 1638974481
description: "One of the nice things with GraphQL for API design is that it enforces type-safety in the schema that we define. But alas, these types are embedded as part of our schema and that type safety is lost for our resolvers, resolver variables, consuming clients and so on, requiring us to recreate the type system. It’d be so much easier if we could leverage our schema type system in our application. This sounds like a job for type generation, but how do we do that? We’ll take a look at a tool that can generate you TypeScript type definitions, then implement our backend using them before looking at how they can plug into the front end with React (or Angular or Vue or Svelte or whatever is the framework of the month!). We’ll cap off by learning how to model our storage platform effectively, using a separate type system for storage and combine them with the GraphQL schema types, producing a rich, strongly types, end-to-end development model.\n\n\nCheck out more of our featured speakers and talks at\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/"
