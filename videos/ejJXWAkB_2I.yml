recordingDate: 1554205838
description: "MIT Sloan Management Review published an article in 2007 titled Avoiding the Alignment Trap in IT. What the researchers discovered is that organizations don’t become high performing by starting initiatives focused on aligning business and technology. Rather, only by improving delivery performance first was it possible to achieve IT Enabled Growth.\n\nThis presentation shows why Agile transformations won't save your software delivery challenges, what supporting evidence has accumulated in the last decade, and how to avoid the common traps that occur in digital transformations.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
