description: 'Human character control has always been a challenging task in game development, but this has been changing in recent years. New technology enables making animations that are more realistic on a budget. In this talk we will discuss the latest advances in interactive human character animation and control including budget body tracking, artificial behaviour and physics interaction. This is an important development for virtual reality, but can be used for any environment with human characters.'
