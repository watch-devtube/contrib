recordingDate: 1520848237
description: "Mobx and Redux are both awesome, but with every advantage there is also a disadvantage. What if there was a way to take the good from both, but leave the bad behind? In this talk, Yedidya introduces Remx, the homegrown state management solution from the Wix Engineering mobile team. He explains its history and the decisions made during its development.\n\nYedidya Kennard is a mobile developer at the Wix mobile team. Coming from an Android native background, since joining Wix he's been working mainly with React-Native and developing a love-hate relationship with JavaScript along the way."
