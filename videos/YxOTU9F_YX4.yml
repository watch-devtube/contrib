description: "In programming, as in writing, we can express similar ideas in a variety of different ways. Kotlin in particular often allows us to approach the same problem with several valid solutions. The ability to choose the best tool for your situation is powerful, but only if you have a way to identify which tool is indeed best for your situation. \n\nIn this talk, we look at common programming problems with multiple possible approaches and evaluate the tradeoffs, from both performance and maintainability standpoints, of choosing one over the others. Whether you're wondering how to choose between with, apply, and let, or curious about the performance implications of using asSequence to lazy load items with map and filter, this talk with give you the context you need to make decisions about where and when to use the various language features Kotlin provides you.\n\nChristina Lee is an Android developer at Pinterest, where she works on Core Product initiatives, including video and networking."
