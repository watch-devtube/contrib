description: "Got a Pull Request for Diego? Learn the Why, What and How to Contribute to Diego - Jen Spinney, HPE & Luan Santos, Pivotal\n\nSo you’ve found a bug in Diego, and you’re excited to make a contribution to the project. Great! Now how do you get your fix accepted into the Diego codebase? \n\nThis talk will walk through the process of implementing a small change, writing and running the tests, and following the Diego team’s best practices for Golang development. It will cover common reasons for pull requests to be rejected and peel back the curtains on how the Diego team handles code contributions from developers outside the core team. \n\nWe will use the Diego project as a concrete example, but many of the steps discussed will apply to the other Cloud Foundry projects as well.\n\nAbout Luan Santos\nLuan Santos is a Pivotal developer and core contributor to the Cloud Foundry platform. He is a member of the Diego team, located in San Francisco, CA. He also spoke at the CF Summit 2015 in Santa Clara, CA about the Cloud Foundry API.\n\nAbout Jen Spinney\nJen Spinney is a software engineer at HP Enterprise, where she works as a core contributor on the CF Diego team. Prior to HPE, she worked at Microsoft on the OData team where she developed a passion for open source and cross-company software development. She pairs remotely from the HPE office in Seattle, WA."
