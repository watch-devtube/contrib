recordingDate: 1382429738
description: "A talk from Barcelona Ruby Conference 2013 (http://baruco.org)\n\nThis talk explores how to get the most out of the hours behind a keyboard. It looks at what motivates us, how to avoid distractions, be happy, and generally be more productive, specifically in the world of Ruby. It looks at how to refactor the most important system you'll ever use - yourself. It's a non-technical and laugh-out-loud type of talk, but it contains lots of valuable thought-provoking information and practical ideas to make you a better developer. It aims to leave you feeling motivated and better equipped to become excellent at what you do, and to enjoy doing so.\n\nhttp://www.baruco.org/talks/refactoring-your-productivity\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)"
