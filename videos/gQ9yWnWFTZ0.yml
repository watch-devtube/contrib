description: "It’s impossible to avoid the drumbeat of the mobile computing revolution: smartphones and tablets are now a permanent fixture in the IT landscape, and we must write applications that support them. So it’s important to understand how to extend existing applications for mobile support and how to build new applications that support mobile as well as desktop users. Fortunately for JavaServer Faces (JSF) developers, the framework fully supports mobile devices. This session starts with an overview of the different approaches to mobile development and discusses solutions from PrimeFaces, RichFaces, ICEfaces, and Oracle Application Development Framework Mobile.\n\n\nAuthor:\nKito Mann\nKito D.
