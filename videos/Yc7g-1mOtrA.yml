description: "RustConf 2018 - Rust and the Web Platform: A Rookie’s Guide by Sarah Meyer\n\nHave you heard the good news about WebAssembly? Since the unlamented demise of Flash, the only choice for writing web applications has been everyone's favorite punching bag of a programming language: JavaScript. WebAssembly defines a new binary format for code that can run natively from all major browsers. The best part is that you can write WebAssembly code in Rust to benefit from Rust's performance and safety guarantees in a place that's never seen them before: the web! Come find out how to get started on your own WebAssembly modules, and contribute to making the web platform a more powerful, useful tool than ever before."
