description: "There are many exciting things happening with AI, from which, until recently, JavaScript developers were largely shut out. But things are changing, if you can do npm install @tensorflow/tfjs or make an API call, you can now do AI. In this fast-paced talk, I'll open your mind to what's possible by demoing several AI-powered JavaScript apps and show you how they were built using either TensorFlow.js or easy to use AI powered APIs. You don't need a PhD in Maths, you don't need years of experience, you just need imagination and the willingness to try.\n\nAsim is a developer, trainer, author and speaker with over 18 years experience working for organisations such as the European Space Agency, Google and now Microsoft, where he is leading Developer Advocacy for EMEA.\n              \n\nJSConf.Asia - LASALLE College of the Arts, Singapore - 16 June 2019\n\nSource: https://2019.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
