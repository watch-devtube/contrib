description: "Microservice API styles, service lookups, datastores, scaling – all of our typical discussions about microservices seem to be centered around backend topics. But what about the user interface? How are we supposed to structure what is arguably the most important part of our applications – the one facing our users? In this session we’ll explore the role of the UI aspect in a microservice architecture, look at various methods of modularization, and derive a set of guidelines for avoiding monolithic frontends.\n\nStefan Tilkov is a co-founder and principal consultant at innoQ, a technology consulting company with offices in Germany and Switzerland. He has been involved in the design of large-scale, distributed systems for more than two decades, using a variety of technologies and tools. He has authored numerous articles, authored and contributed to several books, and is a frequent speaker at conferences around the world.\n\n[OUB-2765]"
