title: 'Performance as a First Class Feature with NBench - Aaron Stannard'
recordingDate: 1472640117
description: "Although you can use unit tests and code reviews to detect functional problems with code changes and pull requests, using those same mechanisms to detect performance problems with code is utterly ineffective. Even skilled developers who have detailed knowledge about the internals of the .NET framework and CLR are unable to correctly predict how changes to code will impact its performance.\nAnd that's why we developed NBench - a .NET performance-testing, stress-testing, and benchmarking framework for .NET applications that works and feels a lot like a unit test.\n\nIn this talk you'll learn about NBench - the new automated performance testing framework developers are using to measure things like throughput, memory allocation, GC overhead, and more inside their .NET applications."
