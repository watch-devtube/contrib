Most compilers have started implementing most of these (relaxed, seq_cst, acquire, release, acq_rel) but not consume (For that you will need to see Paul's talk which naturally follows this talk.) For this, I will deep dive into what each memory model setting means (especially for Games Development and low latency, a new SG14 in the C++ Standard) and how C++11 atomics are used to improve handling of mutable shared state. We have improved on it in C++14 and have more crazy things planned for C++17. I will also look at how C++ atomics are a natural precursor to SG5's Transactional Memory which was approved in Lenexa for publication.\n— \nMichael Wong is the CEO of OpenMP. He is the IBM and Canadian representative to the C++ Standard and OpenMP Committee. He is also a Director of ISOCPP.org and a VP, Vice-Chair of Programming Languages for Canada’s Standard Council. He has so many titles, it’s a wonder he can get anything done.\nHe chairs the WG21 SG5 Transactional Memory and SG14 Games Development/Low Latency, and is the co-author of a number C++11/OpenMP/Transactional Memory features including generalized attributes, user-defined literals, inheriting constructors, weakly ordered memory models, and explicit conversion operators. Having been the past C++ team lead to IBM’s XL C++ compiler means he has been messing around with designing C++ compilers for twenty years. His current research interest, i.e. what he would like to do if he had time is in the area of parallel programming, transactional memory, C++ benchmark performance, object model, generic programming and template metaprogramming. He holds a B.Sc from University of Toronto, and a Masters in Mathematics from University of Waterloo.\n\nHe has been asked to speak at ACCU, C++Now, Meeting C++, ADC++, CASCON, Bloomberg, CERN, and many Universities, research centers and companies.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
