description: 'So-called "in-air" gesture interfaces (Kinect, Leap Motion, Myo) fly in the face of basic human insight and are leading to a future that is as completely unusable as it is silly looking. Alex gives a brief overview of the evolution of computer interfaces, surveys the existing gestural field, discuss ergonomics, semiotics, and hand-waving, curses John Underkoffler and Tom Cruise, rails against the loss of agency in an automated world, and describes a design approach to gestures and gestural interfaces that does work.'
