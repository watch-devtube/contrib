description: "❗️ATTENTION ❗️\nRegistration to 🚀DevTernity 2018 is running:\n✅ https://devternity.com\n\nThere are a lot of concepts in software development, that look perfect on the whiteboard, and then completely suck in practice. Due to years of things like implementing ESB where it’s not needed, programming with EJB, where it brings only tears and blood, our industry has build a distrust for Ph.D., ex-cathedra, design by committee and generally any theory not tested in reality. We have learned to make small steps, proof-of-concepts, spikes, proper research. Yet, even with small steps, TDD and the like, the architecture we design backfires months later in unpredictable ways. That happens quite often because architects disregard the organization’s structure and culture completely. Melvin Conway described why communication structures eat your architecture for breakfast, as early as 1968. Since then, many have noticed, that the culture your company has, eats both architecture and structure even before breakfast. Clearly, you cannot think about architecture, without taking both into account. In this talk we’ll look at some architecture decisions, and how nice design brakes due to structure and culture of the organization. We already have developers and operations cooperating as DevOps. Perhaps we need the same for architects and managers?"
