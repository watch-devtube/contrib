description: "Have you been misusing the term web performance? Colt McAnlis, a developer advocate at Google, says that web performance is more than just how fast a page loads. It is also the experience a user has while using your app.\n\nFor this talk, Colt supplies a \"programmer's checklist\" for building HTML5 apps capable of making smooth transitions from desktop to mobile. If you work in an environment where the performance of your application matters to your companies bottom line, or if you just want to share some laughs with Colt while learning a thing or two about web performance, definitely check out this fun talk from HTML5DevConf.\n\n#perfmatters\n\n**More HTML5 developer resources available at: http://marakana.com/s/tags/html5"
