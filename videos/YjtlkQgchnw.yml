description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2016 - Brussels, January 27-29 2016\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\nSo this one day, I am playing the board game Quarto with my friend and I wonder, can this game end in a tie, or is there always a winner? Normal people might have squabbled or shrugged, but not us nerds! We obviously abandoned the game, took our laptops to the local pub and started hacking. In this talk I will explain how I used F# to transform this problem to satisfiability, ran it through a sat solver to discover if it can indeed end in a tie. I will also show how to apply the same technique to more real-life problems such as scheduling."
