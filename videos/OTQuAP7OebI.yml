description: "Get exposed to a new paradigm of web app development which brings Production and Development environments into a common place. Hence, eliminating the painstaking effort and time spent on moving from Development to Production and get exposed to the Development of Shippable and Demo-able Software from Day One of your project's development phase, the true Agile way. In addition, PHP developers can also look forward to a Framework that supports this approach at the end of the talk.\n\nHamzeen is a software engineer and a practitioner of agile with expertise on Java, PHP, JS, C++, Computer Vision, & Signal Processing.
