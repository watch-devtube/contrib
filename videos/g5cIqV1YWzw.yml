title: 'How Value Stream Networks Will Transform IT and Business - Dr. Mik Kersten'
recordingDate: 1531288037
description: "Dr. Mik Kersten spent a decade creating open source developer tools before realizing that programing was not the bottleneck of large-scale software delivery. Since that time, he has been working on creating a model and tools for connecting the end-to-end software value stream. Prior to founding Tasktop, Mik created the Eclipse Mylyn open source project as part of his PhD in Computer Science, pioneering the integration of development tools with the delivery pipeline. As a research scientist at Xerox PARC, Mik implemented the first aspect-oriented programming tools for AspectJ. Mik is the CEO of Tasktop and loves working with IT and thought leaders on transforming how software is built.\n\nDOES18 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
