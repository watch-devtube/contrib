recordingDate: 1493344007
description: "Join key members from Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and Oomph, Inc., as they discuss the strategies that drove key UX & Design decisions for a major healthcare insurer website. This case study will look at how a corporate organization with widespread content owners benefitted from a flexible component-based design system combined with the power of the Paragraphs module.\_\n\nResearch during the Discovery phase led us to decide we needed to focus on a content-first design strategy and not on specific templates or layouts. We'll review the varied design patterns, show how they're implemented, and demonstrate how BCBS.com web admins can control the format, placement and usage of design components on a per-page basis. Attendees will walk away with great insight into the process of producing a great user experience for a large-scale project with a content-first design approach."
