description: "Intro: VMware SIG - Fabio Rapposelli & Steve Wong, VMware \n\nJoin the SIG VMware introduction session to learn our mission, recent accomplishments and discuss future work. We will also focus on how new contributors can get involved in the SIG. Kubernetes has the concept of a Cloud Provider, which is a standardized module which allows Kubernetes to run on various platforms which might have different implementations of networking, storage, and node management. Kubernetes is in the process of moving to a new “out of tree” cloud manager architecture to allow cloud providers to have independent feature and patch release cycles. Learn how the vSphere cloud provider is evolving to meet this new model. This session will outline how to get started when you deploy Kubernetes on vSphere infrastructure, on-prem or in a public cloud. Material covered is applicable to kubeadm deployments, and when using Kubernetes distributions on vSphere infrastructure. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrbA"
