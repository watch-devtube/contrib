description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotsecurity.io on April 21st in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nThere is a very strong tension in the security industry right now between the proponents of end-to-end encryption and those who use network inspection as a core tool to understand threats and information flows. This debate is particularly relevant to the web, where HTTPS adoption passed 50 percent this year and tensions continues to rise. New research shows that both intercepting proxies and anti-virus software are reducing the security of encrypted connections significantly.\nIn this talk, Nicks explores the various angles of this debate within a historical context."
