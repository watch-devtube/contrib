description: "Implementing Languages on the BEAM\nhttp://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2014/robert-virding\n\nThe BEAM, the Erlang VM, was designed to implement Erlang. This has led to that the features it provides and its limitations are different from most other VMs. In this talk we learn will why the BEAM looks like it does and how this affects the implementation of languages on it. We will also show the Erlang compiler workflow and how to use this when implementing languages. Finally we will show examples of how to \"go beyond\" the BEAM and implement features for which it was wasn't originally designed and the costs this can entail."
