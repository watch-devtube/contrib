Even more exciting is to refactor existing CSS / frontend foundations which became cluttered.\n\nRunning into consistency issues between code and design which slow down the development of user interface iterations is a common problem in fast-growing applications when the development doesn't follow efficient guidelines, style guides and utilizes an efficient process.\n\nAt the beginning of 2015 we began establishing a design/frontend system and improving our design-development workflow at trivago. We introduced a pattern library, started utilizing atomic design in our workflow, created new coding guidelines, and adapted several methodologies like BEM and ITCSS in order to support us in maintaining and developing our CSS/UI on a large scale.\n\nThe talk will provide backgrounds, insights, learnings and technical approaches of refactoring a CSS base on a large scale project including its scope, the outcome and the business value."
