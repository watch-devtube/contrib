They are also universally useful no matter what kind of developer you are. Whether you are building out a customer service bot or automating daily tasks through your preferred Chat program, the barrier to entry for making a chatbot can be trivially low and allow everyone on your team to contribute. So what better way to learn about your technology ecosystem than by throwing it all on your Chatbot? Please join us as we take what could have been a 10 line microservice and turn it into a containerized distributed highly available passion project with a dash of open-source Machine Learning frameworks running on Kubernetes. \nTopics:\nChatbot Overview \nMaking your Chatbot run on Kubernetes\nDistributing your Chatbot \nGiving your Chatbot Persistent state\nBlue/Green Push button deployments for your Chatbot\n Empowering your Chatbot with ML\"\n\nTo learn more: https://sched.co/GrUm"
