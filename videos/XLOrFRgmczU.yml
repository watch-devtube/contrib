description: "Filmed in Barcelona at ElixirConf EU 2017\n\nI would like to present a brief overview of the variety of tools available for visual reasoning about concurrency patterns, ranging from Erlang/OTP (Observer, erlyberly) through Elixir ecosystem (visualixir), to the toolset available for other concurrent platforms like Go (gotrace, streamtools). The second goal is to showcase a proof of concept for a visual tool that extends the feature set of the aforementioned ones, with a strong focus on specific Elixir abstractions (like GenStage + Flow), rather than concurrency primitives.\n\nElixirConf EU is a community conference created to promote education, networking and collaboration within the Elixir/Erlang/Ruby communities."
