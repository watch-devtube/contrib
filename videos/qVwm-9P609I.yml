title: 'How to Make a Tensorflow Neural Network (LIVE)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1481137003
description: "In this live stream, we're going to use Tensorflow to build a convolutional neural network capable of classifying images. You'll need 'tensorflow' and the 'future' python libraries installed. The connection was laggy for the live stream and that won't happen again. \n\n4:09-5:50 (The connection drops out)\n\nThe code for this video is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/tensorflow_neural_net_live_demo/blob/master/README.md\n\nMore learning resources:\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html\nhttp://deeplearning.net/tutorial/gettingstarted.html\nhttp://machinelearningmastery.com/handwritten-digit-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-networks-python-keras/\nhttps://www.oreilly.com/learning/not-another-mnist-tutorial-with-tensorflow?log-in\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
