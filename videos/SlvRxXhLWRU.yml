description: "From Velocity Santa Clara 2015: The U.S. Digital Service was launched in August 2014 as a crazy gamble to see if the strategy that succeeded at pulling Healthcare.gov out of the fire could be applied to other government problems. Now at nine months old and about 130 people, the U.S. Digital Service has taken on immigration, education, Social Security, cyber-security, and Veterans Affairs. Mikey will talk about how those things are going, and what the team has learned about driving change in the largest institution in history.\n\nAbout Mikey Dickerson (Federal Government | United States Digital Services Team):\nMikey Dickerson worked in Site Reliability Engineering at Google from 2006 to 2014, modulo side trips to work on the Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012. In 2013 he took one more leave of absence to join what\nbecame known as the “ad hoc” team that rescued healthcare.gov after its disastrous launch on October 1. He has been on a baffling through-the-looking-glass adventure ever since, including a move in\nAugust 2014 to become the Administrator of the newly created United States Digital Service.\n\nWatch more from the 2015 Velocity Conference: https://goo.gl/jS3T6Z\nFind out more about Velocity: http://velocityconf.com/\nDon't miss an upload!
