title: 'Clojure, REPL & TDD: Feedback at Ludicrous Speed - Avishai Ish-Shalom'
recordingDate: 1535356449
description: 'When starting with Clojure, newcomers often program using the same patterns they used too - code, run tests, drink coffee & repeat until feature is done. But Clojure encourages a different programming mindset: explorative, rapid prototyping; The language and it''s ecosystem make it very easy to get rapid feedback and iterate quickly on design. In this talk, Avishai introduces some Clojure patterns that enable this rapid feedback - REPL programming & the reloaded pattern and show how these supercharge TDD.'
