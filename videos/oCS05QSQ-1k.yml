description: "Most people think peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are just for file sharing, but it turns out you can also build other types of applications on P2P networks with advantages like enhanced privacy and security. We’ll walk through the process of building an increasingly complex P2P cloud storage system (think Dropbox), and touch on the challenges you’d run into and some of their possible solutions. Topics include efficiently locating data within a large network and building a system where we can trust random people on the internet with our personal files.\n\nEVENT:\n\nSFNode Meetup July 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nDylan Barnard\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nSFNode Meetup Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sN3cT5T-5g"
