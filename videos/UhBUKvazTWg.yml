It has become smarter and more\nnatural, and people expect it to “just work.” But, anyone who has worked\nbehind-the-scenes with a search engine knows exactly how hard it is to get the\n“right” results to show up at the right time. \n\nNot to mention, what happens when the trends change, when your users’ favorite\nweirdly-shaped dinosaur isn’t a T-Rex anymore? Spending countless hours tuning\nthe boosts before your user can find their favorite two-legged tiny-armed\ndinosaur on the front page isn’t fun. What is cool is using Learning to Rank to\nautomate the process! In this talk, you will learn how Learning to Rank works\nand how you can use it in Apache Solr — all from the Bloomberg team that built\nand implemented it in the first place. Description\n\nInternet search has long evolved from days when you had to string up your query in just the right way to get the results you were looking for. Search has to be smart and natural, and people expect it to “just work” and read what’s on their minds. \n\nOn the other hand, anyone who has worked behind-the-scenes with a search engine knows exactly how hard it is to get the right result to show up at the right time. Countless hours are spent tuning the boosts before your user can find his favorite two-legged tiny-armed dinosaur on the front page. \n\nWhen your data is constantly evolving, updating, it’s only realistic that so do your search engines. Search teams thus are on a constant pursuit to refine and improve the ranking and relevance of their search results. But, working smart is not the same as working hard. There are many techniques we can employ, that can help us dynamically improve and automate this process. One such technique is Learning to Rank. \n\nLearning to Rank was initially proposed in academia around 20 years ago and almost all commercial web search-engines utilize it in some form or other. At Bloomberg, we decided that it was time for an open source search-engine to support Learning to Rank, so we spent more than a year designing and implementing it. The result of our efforts has been accepted by the Solr community and our Learning to Rank plugin is now available in Apache Solr. \n\nThis talk will be presented by two engineers working in the News Search Engineering team at Bloomberg - Sambhav Kothari and Diego Ceccarelli. The talk will serve as an introduction to the LTR(Learning-to-Rank) module in Solr. No prior knowledge about Learning to Rank is needed, but attendees will be expected to know the basics of Python, Solr, and machine learning techniques. We will be going step-by-step through the process of shipping a machine-learned ranking model in Solr, including: \n\n\nhow you can engineer features and build a training data-set as per your needs\nhow you can train ranking models using popular Python ML(machine learning) libraries like scikit-learn\nhow you can use the above-learned ranking-models in Solr\n\n\n\nGet ready for an interactive session where we learn to rank! \n\nRoom: K.3.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 11:00:00+01"
