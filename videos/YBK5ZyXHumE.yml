In part two we’ll create our first page and style it to look like w3schools.\n\nMake sure to follow CodeTap on YouTube or FaceBook. Two other free resources I recommend for you that you don’t have to pay anything at all are:\nW3schools.com, where you can literally start from scratch and discover more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and many more. To put your new skills in practice and test them, w3schools goes hand in hand with FreeCodeCamp.org which has a great and amazing community around the world. You can check them on FaceBook by searching for “free code camp” and join the world community or one that’s closer to you. I really like that the challenges on Free Code Camp will prepare you for the real world client requirements, so it’s a double win.\n\nThanks for watching this video. You’ve been really amazing.\nAs a reminder, and I’ll stress this every time, one of your most powerful tools to help you discover and understand better the world of coding, which you already own, is to be social and leave comments, to leverage the power of a community. So go on and leave a comment below right now, here or anywhere, with your thoughts, anything goes, don’t worry about it. Something like: I’ve understood how to create an HTML tag, really awesome, I’m so excited!, or, I’m having trouble with JavaScript variables, could you help me out? Or, I like you hair! You can be a bit weird too. Be as descriptive as possible as help is on the way. I promise I’ll do my best to answer each and every one of your comments.\nShow me some real love and give this movie the thumbs up or down.
