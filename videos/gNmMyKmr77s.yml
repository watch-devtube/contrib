description: "Applying DevOps to the Core for the UK’s Biggest IT Estate\n\nMayank Prakash, Chief Digital and Information Officer, Department for Work and Pensions UK\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is the UK’s biggest government department and is scaling its ambitious digital transformation plans which are making leaders across industries take notice.\n\nIs it a retail bank, a large asset management firm, the largest contact centre or a huge operational organisation? DWP serves 22 million customers at critical points in their lives – for example, when looking for work, transitioning to retirement, or when families are separating. Its compelling purpose has attracted over 1,000 professionals to join DWP Digital recently. It has a workforce of 85,000, and with a presence in most UK high streets, has one of Europe’s biggest IT estates, runs Europe’s largest VOIP contact centres and transacts £170bn in payments every year. \n\nIn this presentation, Mayank Prakash, DWP’s CDIO, charts DWP’s journey from an organisation based on traditional vendor outsourcing, traditional structures and service delivery models to one with digital in its DNA. He shares how DevOps, design thinking, innovative technologies and collaborative colleagues who know their craft underpin DWP Digital’s strategy to deliver.\n\nDOES17 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
