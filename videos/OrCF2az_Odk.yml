description: "100% Big Data. 0% Hadoop. 0% Java\n\n\"If your data is big enough, Hadoop it!\" That's simply not true - there is much more behind this term than just a tool. In this talk I will show one possible, practically working approach and the corresponding selection of tools that help collect, mine, move around, store and provision large, unstructured data amounts. Completely without Hadoop. And even completely without Java.\n\nTalk objectives: Show how continuous analytics of large amounts of random data can be done without Hadoop, Java and corresponding tools. With a big portion of Erlang, of course. Oh, and Riak.\n\nTarget audience: Developers, Architects, Managers, Project leads, geeks"
