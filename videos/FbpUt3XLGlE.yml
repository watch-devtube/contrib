description: "This is an exclusive presentation by Estelle Weyl from her Fluent Conference 2012 talk. \n\nTargeting a DOM node? Determining a CSS class? Storing and retrieving custom values on nodes in the DOM tree? No need to include a library. Dataset, classlist and queryselector can do it all for us. In this session we cover these well supported technologies that you may have missed. You may not need to include a framework after all. In this session we cover the HTML5 dataset API and the Selectors API.\n\nAbout Estelle Weyl\n\nEstelle Weyl started her professional life in architecture, then managed teen health programs. In 2000, she took the natural step of becoming a web standardista. She has consulted for Kodakgallery, SurveyMonkey, Samsung, Yahoo! and Apple, among others. Estelle shares esoteric tidbits learned while programming CSS, JavaScript and XHTML and detailed grids of CSS3 and HTML5 browser support in her blog at http://www.standardista.com. She is a co-author of Mobile HTML5, HTML5: The Definitive Guide and HTML5 and CSS3 for the Real World. While not coding, she works in construction, de-hippifying her 1960's throwback abode."
