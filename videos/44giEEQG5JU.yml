description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nJosh Long - Spring Developer Advocate\n\nABSTRACT\nLet's face it, the cloud's here to stay. Spring's always been about portability and choice, and the cloud is no different. CloudFoundry, introduced to rave reviews and massive enthusiasm in the NOSQL, Node.js, Ruby, Scala and Java communities, represents the most promising, most open cloud platform for Java and Spring applications today, and tomorrow. In this talk, Josh Long will introduce CloudFoundry, it's architecture, and how it can be used with existing Spring applications and new ones, leveraging Spring 3.1.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
