description: "by Stéphane Bidoul\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.120/python_discover_graphql.webm\n\n\nGraphQL is the hottest new technology for building APIs, sometimes touted as a better REST. This practical talk aims at explaining what GraphQL is and how it can help expose an elegant and flexible API for advanced business applications in record time. Real code examples will be shown, based on the Graphene library and Odoo Community. Care will be taken so the audience can easily transpose those to other python frameworks such as Django, Tryton or sqlalchemy. A short comparison of GraphQL with other familiar \"RPC\" technologies such as SOAP and REST will be provided, as well as a discussion of strengths, weaknesses and potential pitfalls. Talk structure: \n\n\nGraphQL, a short introduction\nDemonstration, code examples using Python Graphene and Odoo Community\nHow GraphQL relates to other technologies, such as REST and SOAP\n\n\nbenefits,\nweaknesses,\npotential pitfalls.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom: UD2.120 (Chavanne)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 09:30:00+01"
