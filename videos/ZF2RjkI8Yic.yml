description: "I believe that technology should be a part of our everyday life. It should be seamless, easy to use, and help us get through the day.\nThat is why I am working at Syneto. I started 7 years ago as a mid level software developer, growing into a senior developer, a scrum master, a team leader, a coach, and a mentor. This experience, and the other 8 years before, gave ma an opportunity to experience a vide variety of interaction with people and technology. Building on this I strive to pass on my experience to others through mentoring, coaching, and by speaking at conferences.\n\nSummary Talk \nFrom the four statements that the agile manifesto gave us, we often succeed in the last three. We often manage to make software that works, we try to listen to our customers, and we even sacrifice personal time to respond to change in a timely manner.\nBut what about individuals and interactions? The principle that “we have come to value individuals and interactions over processes and tools” often remains ignored. And the discussions continue about what processes should we adopt and what tools should we use.\nIn this session, I will share with you my two years experience of growing up as a team leader, mentor, and coach for the team I work with daily.\nWe will see the greatest fears of interactions, we will discuss why individuals are not valued.\nThen we will dive into some psychological and social issues so we can understand what is actually happening in the minds of each individual. The topics will cover anxiety, indecision, fear of speaking up, fighting instead of talking, the difference between dialog and discussion, too little or too much involvement in interactions.\nFinally, some tips and tricks, some best practices, and some do not’s will be presented."
