description: "The gap of what the web can do versus what must be done in a native application is really small these days.\n\nI'd like to show that progressive web apps (offline support, push notifications, manifest, etc) are just the beginning. We can leverage newer hardware and networking APIs to build all sorts of Internet of Things types of applications.\n\nThis could possibly connect some of the dots for attendees that have ideas for software they'd like to build, but not necessarily understand just how far the web has come.\n\nI would briefly touch on PWAs in general, then move on to transport streams (sockets, p2p, etc) and how they enable communication, then move onto hardware APIs (bluetooth, USB, MIDI, etc) and how we can use the browser and isomorphic libraries (noble, johnny-five, etc) to tie things together.\n\nLuis Montes is the founder and CEO of Iced Development. He brings 18 years of medical, manufacturing, and financial enterprise software experience. Iced Development is a Phoenix based web and IoT company focused on providing services around the latest innovations. It was founded on a desire to advance the open web, and driven by continual excitement for ever-evolving technologies.\n\nEVENT:\n\nFullstack Fest 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nLuis Montes\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7xqKMiPK_0&t=201s"
