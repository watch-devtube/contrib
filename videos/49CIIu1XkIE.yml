description: "Speaker: Sara Packman\n\nCongratulations on finishing your first tutorials or classes in python! In the parlance of the hero’s journey myth, you’ve had your ‘threshold moment”: you’ve started down a path that could lead to a long and fulfilling career. But the road to this glorious future is frustratingly obscured by a lack of guidance in the present. You know enough to realize that you don’t have all the skills you need yet, but it’s hard to know how to learn those skills, or even articulate what they are. There are no easy solutions to this problem. There are, however, a few fundamental things to know and advice to keep in mind. Drawing from my own experience and with input from others, I’ve compiled some helpful hints about the skills, tools, and guiding questions that will get you to mastery.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
