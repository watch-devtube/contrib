title: 'Mastering C2DM: The Android Cloud to Device Messaging Framework'
language: English
recordingDate: 1299884573
description: "While many people agree that Android's 2.2 release was a major milestone in its evolutionary path, one of the most important features is yet waiting to be discovered: C2DM.\n\nThe Android Cloud to Device Messaging framework, which was first introduced at Google I/O 2010, has the potential to enable a whole new breed of applications for the platform. In a nutshell, C2DM makes it possible for developers to push data from their servers to their applications on Android devices. \n\nC2DM is a relatively simple, very light-weight, messaging technology that transcends carriers' networks and allows  innovative ways to connect with our users - all without having to drain batteries on their phones or waste wireless data, which is what we were forced to do with pull/polling-based approaches.\n\nIn this session you will learn about C2DM, the protocol, its requirements, its limitations, and how to get started in building applications that take advantage this amazing framework. You will get to see a complete end-to-end application (both the Android-client and its server-side counterpart) and understand how all of the pieces fit together."
