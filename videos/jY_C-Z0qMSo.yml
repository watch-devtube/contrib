title: 'Kernel documentation: what we have and where it''s going'
recordingDate: 1484965402
description: "Jonathan Corbet\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/142/\nThe Linux kernel features an extensive array of, to put it kindly, somewhat disorganized documentation.  A significant effort is underway to make things better, though.  This talk will review the state of kernel documentation, cover the changes that are being made (including the adoption of a new system for formatted documentation), and discuss how interested developers can help."
