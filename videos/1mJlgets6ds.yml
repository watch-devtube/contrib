We'll show how these two tools let you make a first pass at solving almost any machine learning problem you might face.\n\nAbout John Myles White\n\nJohn Myles White is a Ph.D. student in the Princeton Psychology Department, where he studies how humans make decisions both theoretically and experimentally.
