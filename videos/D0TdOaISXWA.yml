description: "Wireless for events becomes more and more ‘normal’ and a must but it was far from when we started of 6 years ago.\n\nGet an insight into the infrastructure and challenges we have faced over these 6 editions.\n\nGlenn De Haes\nMy wireless journey started back in 2001 when there was still pre-Wi-Fi equipment.
