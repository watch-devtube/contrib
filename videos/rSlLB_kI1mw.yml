This talk will focus our operational and release process that is very unique to such a large websites. I'll be walking through a typical change from inception to the final deployment into production. We use a combination of tools and culture to help us scale this process to over a thousand engineers and tens of thousands of servers with a very small team of release engineers.\n\nGirish has been with Facebook since early 2008 working the on Technical Operations and Infrastructure teams. Having been the only release tools engineer for over two years where the site grew over 10x, Girish has had to use every trick in the book to keep up with the growth of infrastructure as well as number of developers. Today, Girish works out of Facebook's London engineering office and leads the tools team."
