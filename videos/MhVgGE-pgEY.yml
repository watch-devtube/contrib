recordingDate: 1389999342
description: "www.ng-conf.org\n\nng-conf is a two day, single track conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 500 to 700 Developers from across the country will converge on beautiful Salt Lake City, UT to participate in training sessions by the Google Angular team, and other Angular experts. In addition to the invaluable training, ng-conf will deliver a premier conference experience for attendees, providing opportunities to network with other developers, relax at social events, and engage in some of the unique entertainment opportunities available in Utah.\n\nAri Lerner\nTopic: Giving a human face to robotics: powering interfaces with AngularJS to the Arduino.\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss the power of the arduino to interface software with the rest of our human experience. We'll discuss the real-time nature of the arduino and how we can surface the sensor data through a real-time interface. We'll explore the power Angular affords us to make these interfaces rapidly as well as the best practices to how to build them, using services, directives, and sockets. In this presentation, we'll demo our robotic interfaces and publicly release our source to encourage audience participation."
