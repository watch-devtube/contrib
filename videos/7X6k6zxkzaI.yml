description: "Slides: https://speakerdeck.com/philnash/the-web-is-getting-pushy\n\nhttp://jsconfbp.com/#philnash\n\nThe battle between native and web rages on. The browsers are fighting hard to tear down the benefits that native developers have relied on since the inception of mobile platforms. Geolocation, sorted. Accelerometer, done. Performance, we'll come back to that. But one of the greatest draws for native developers has been push notifications, for the web, email alerts just don't cut it. \n\nBut now, new in browsers for 2015, is the Service Worker. Born out of the struggle to make the Appcache work for offline capable sites it has also brought the advent of push notifications to the web. Through building up an example application live we will see how to implement the Service Worker to not only serve up an app when we're offline but enhance the online experience with push notifications. \n\nThe battle may continue, but the web is definitely pushing back."
