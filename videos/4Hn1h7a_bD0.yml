title: 'ChatOps:  Taking DevOps and Agile to the Next Level'
recordingDate: 1501170299
description: 'Imagine that you can drive your shop''s work through conversation. That''s what we strive for with Agile practices and what we want to see with our company culture. ChatOps is just the solution for that by helping to leverage technology to create solutions driven by our normal communication. Developers and QA engineers can self-service many tasks that traditionally passed off to an operations group. Plus, by using a chat server as the base for communications, a shop can increase shared understanding of work. Training new employees becomes trivial by having a shared console for doing work.The benefits for a development shop for using ChatOps is amazing. This session will do a deep dive on ChatOps, show examples of implementing ChatOps in a shop, and discuss strategies for addressing culture and implementing ChatOps. We will end with conversation to inspire thoughts of how attendees can go back to work and immediately start to adopt chatops as a win for everyone on the team.'
