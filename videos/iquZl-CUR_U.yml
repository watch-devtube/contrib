language: English
recordingDate: 1435073125
description: "Scalability is a desirable characteristic of any system. But what does the word \"scalable\" actually mean? In this talk, Garrett will argue that when we use the word \"scalable\" we should instead use the word \"awesome\". Awesome has has the same meaning... but is a lot more fun to say!\n\nGarrett will debunk the myth of scalability and provide a model of software engineering that uses well defined standards of performance and that respects the laws of physics. He'll reveal the secrets of building software that does what it needs to do. You'll learn practical skills to solve real world problems in time and space and build software that your users sit back and say, \"wow, this is really awesome!\"\n\nGarrett is a software engineer at CloudBees and is responsible for building scalable, er, that is, awesome software! At CloudBees Garrett led the development of the RUN platform-as-a-service that provided reliable, performant application hosting to tens of thousands of customers, which in turn served tens of millions of end-users!\n\nGarrett's weapon of choice for the development of awesome software is Erlang -- a highly concurrent functional programming language that use used by companies like Facebook, WhatsApp and Machine Zone to build the world's largest messaging systems. Garrett is an international speaker and instructor. He organizes the Chicago Erlang User Group which sponsors Chicago Erlang - an annual Erlang conference in the heart of the US. He is the author of several Erlang projects including e2, Psycho, and LambdaPad. He is the creator of the satirical videos MongoDB Is Web Scale, Node.js Is Bad Ass Rock Star Tech, and Erlang The Movie II, The Sequel.\n\nGarrett maintains his blog at http://gar1t.com."
