description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune 29th, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nData structure corruptions are insidious bugs that reduce the reliability of software systems. Programmers have long used assertions to characterize data structure properties. An assertion violation signals a corruption in the program state. At such a state, it is standard to terminate the program, debug it if possible, and re-execute it.\n\nThis talk will discuss a new view: instead of terminating the program, use the violated assertion as a basis of repairing the state of the program and let it continue.\n\nThe talk will present a novel algorithm to repair structurally complex data. Given a structure that violates an assertion that represents its..."
