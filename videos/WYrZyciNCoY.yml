description: "Tameika Reed, Founder of Women In Linux\n\nAbstract: \nThe journey of System Administration has changed over time. We have seen the early years of containers (jails), virtualization, and now the rise of containers. Currently plenty of automation tools ease the job of migrating from VMware to the cloud with Terraform, migrating monolithic applications to containers, and the ability to have a disaster recovery plan in the cloud. So, what is next for system administrators? You have probably seen the rise of:\n\nInfrastructure Engineer\nAutomation Engineer\nSite Reliability Engineer\nBlockchain Infrastructure Engineer\nAI and ML Infrastructure Engineer\nChaos Engineer\nSystem Architect\nPotential up-and-coming areas to explore include:\n\nQuantum Computing\nQuantum Key Distribution and Cryptography\nIntuition Engineering\nIn this keynote I will explore the components that are transferrable across all those disciplines, which system administration skills you should keep sharpened, and which news skills you might want to add to your professional toolbox.\n\nView the full LISA18 Program at https://www.usenix.org/lisa18/conference-program"
