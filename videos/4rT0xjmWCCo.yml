description: "PyData London 2018 \n\nDatabases can be very useful and a real powerhouse for data science projects. Databases have been around for decades and were highly optimised for data aggregations during that time.\n\nThis presentation will provide a crash course about the major differences of the various database systems as relational, NoSQL and graph databases.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
