description: "This session by Catalina Butnaru is based on the question: What if developers used a simple Trello board to check off all ethical concerns pertaining to their project, before it reaches the market? That's what Humans in AI is - a practical, easy to implement work framework that helps companies account for ethical considerations, user adoption and job augmentation before deploying AI in a real environment. The costs attributed to poor end-user adoption are decreased, and the risks of deploying AI-driven systems that do not comply with globally accepted ethical frameworks are averted.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
