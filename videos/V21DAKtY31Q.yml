description: "Refactoring Techniques for Elixir, Ecto, and Phoenix by Gary Rennie\n\nRefactoring is an important aspect of writing software, it makes reading and understanding your code easier for the rest of the team. How many times have you read some code, thought \"\"who wrote this code?!\"\" only to have `git blame` display you as the author 6 months ago?\nFunctional programming makes moving code around very easy, however there is more to refactoring than relocating code. In this talk, we will go over some of the features offered by Elixir, Phoenix and Ecto that can be used to make reading and understanding your code much easier and as a result of this, more maintainable for future you and your team. From getting rid of those nested case statements, to restructuring your entire application."
