description: "A nerdy talk introducing the audience to the concept of encoding bits onto a radio wave. We’ll learn how to pack data tightly to achieve high bandwidth and how to recover from data loss without retransmission. The theories will be put to the test using a Software Defined Radio built using nothing but Node.js and a few radio parts.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNodeConf EU 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nThomas Watson\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNodeConf EU Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nnearForm Ltd YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp2Tsbjd3P8itnBHUNHi82A\n\nnearForm web-site: https://www.nearform.com/"
