description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nWould you believe it that you can feed data coming from various sources (even thousand different resources - like mobile devices) into a system, describe what information you want to extract in a few lines of code and then have all this information in your finger tips? In real time. While the system keeps running?\n\nLDB powers BugSense and analyses data coming from more than 200M mobile devices, in realtime. And even though it is In-Memory, data is actually stored in the hard-drive and replicated across other nodes using the awesome features of Erlang.\n\nWith LDB we don't run queries. We run algorithms due to a full blown custom LISP language written in C that has access to the same address space with the database. That means that you can search extremely fast for data and run complex algorithms insanely faster than any other solutions."
