description: "Speaker: JOHN HUMPHREYS VP OF ENGINEERING INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS, NOMURA\nSpring Boot is a modern and extensible development framework that aims (and succeeds!) to take as much pain as possible out of developing with Java. With just a few Maven dependencies, new or existing programs become runnable, init.d-compliant uber-JARs or uber-WARs with embedded web-servers and virtually zero-configuration, code or otherwise. As an added freebie, Spring Boot Actuator will provide your programs with amazing configuration-free production monitoring facilities that let you have RESTFUL endpoints serving live stack-traces, heap and GC statistics, database statuses, spring-bean definitions, and password-masked configuration file audits."
