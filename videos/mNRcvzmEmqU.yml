description: 'In her role as Head of software development at the Dutch insurtech company ANVA, Kim van Wilgen is responsible for all software product development. Although a nerd at heart, she also has over a decade of experience in product management and comparable managerial roles on the other side: the business. She can speak the language of product owners and users to bridge the gap between business and IT. Kim van Wilgen is passionate about enabling organisations to be small at all levels and cultivating a culture that supports this, using continuous delivery, agile, Kanban, data-driven decision making, DevOps, lean, learning organisations and microservices. Together with agile thought-leader Sander Hoogendoorn, Kim is writing a new book titled The Continuous Culture.'
