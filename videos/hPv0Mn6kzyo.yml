description: 'Containers provide a consistent environment to run services. Kubernetes help us to manage and scale our container cluster. Good start for a loosely coupled microservices architecture but not enough. How do you control the flow of traffic & enforce policies between services? How do you visualize service dependencies & identify issues? How can you provide verifiable service identities, test for failures? You can implement your own custom solutions or you can rely on Istio, an open platform to connect, manage and secure microservices.'
