description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nIst is possible to use clouds and microservice architectures to simplify and shrink the codebase? In this code-only session I will code from scratch a Jakarta EE + MicroProfile microservice with openapi, error handling, metrics. fault tolerance patterns, JSON serialisation, asynchronous or reactive client, health checks, cloud native configuration and kB-sized WARs. Questions are highly appreciated."
