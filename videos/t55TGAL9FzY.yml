description: "serverless sounds like a marketing buzzword when it's really all about not worrying about underlying infrastructure (aka, a good thing)\n\nFaaS (Function as a Service) is only a subset of serverless. As a developer I should be able to provide whichever artifact I'd like - one or more functions, an application, or a container, and use the language(s) of my choice.\n\nOnce youve deployed artifacts to a serverless runtime, how much control do you still have over your app? Can you monitor the user experience of your app? Can you still profile your app? Did you even discuss SLI/SLO/SLA in the first place?\n\nDevOps isnt going away with serverless, its actually becoming even more important with CI/CD and blue/green deployments remaining key best practices.\n\nAlexis Moussine-Pouchkine\nGoogle"
