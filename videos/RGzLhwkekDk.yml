recordingDate: 1558615939
description: "Developers are often unaware of how their users actually see their screens. In this UX design session, we'll discuss the most important principles concerning how the human brain and visual system determine how users see application interfaces.\n\nWe'll look at Gestalt principles for grouping and highlighting, inattentional blindness and change blindness, how users scan through a view, and how to promote clarity in interfaces with levels of emphasis. Tests will help attendees see how they personally experience these principles, and better understand the challenges faced by their users when views and pages are not designed to respect design principles.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
