description: "Filmed in Barcelona at ElixirConf.EU 2017\n\nElixir's plug library is one of the most powerful packages we have within hex. It does not only serves as a foundation for Phoenix but also allows everyone to intercept and modify HTTP requests on the fly. Have you ever wondered how phoenix interacts with the underlying web server? In this talk you will learn how to work with plug. You will see some of plugs implementation details and learn just enough to build your own web server for plug and gain a better understanding of the relationship between Phoenix and Plug\n\nElixirConf.EU is a community conference created to promote education, networking and collaboration within the Elixir/Erlang/Ruby communities."
