description: "Speaker: Annabelle Kwok\r\n\r\n\"When I look at where computing is heading, I see how machine learning and artificial intelligence are unlocking capabilities that were unthinkable only a few years ago. This means that the power of the software — the ‘smarts’ — really matter for hardware more than ever before.\"\"\r\n\r\n- Sundar Pichai (CEO of Google)\r\n\r\nSundar believes the last 10 years were about building a mobile-first world, turning smartphones into remote controls for our lives. But in the next 10 years, the shift will be towards a world that is AI-first, a world where computing becomes universally available — be it at home, at work, in the car, or on the go — and interacting with all of these surfaces becomes much more natural, intuitive, and intelligent.\r\n\r\nMany tech giants today have been investing resources into developing their machine learning and AI capabilities. These includes Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, IBM and many others.\r\n\r\nSo what is AI and machine learning?\r\n\r\nIn this session, Annabelle Kwok (Founder and CEO of SmartCow) will introduce us to the world of AI and machine learning. SmartCow is Singapore's leading company that builds edge-computing devices and provides end-to-end A.I. Driven solutions for industries.\r\n\r\nRegister Here\r\nhttps://www.eventbrite.sg/e/introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-and-how-to-get-started-tickets-27522382186\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.facebook.com/events/297001917409667\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/7sqv/"
