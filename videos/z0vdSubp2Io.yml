title: 'Enabling .NET Apps with Monitoring and Management Using Steeltoe'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538632802
description: "Applications with complex distributed architectures typically have dozens of dependencies which at times fail or become unresponsive. Detecting these problems in a timely fashion and then troubleshooting them in a distributed environment can pose a significant challenge. This developer level talk we will explore how you can use the Steeltoe Management frameworks to enable your .NET application with performance monitoring, management diagnostic endpoints, and distributed tracing all of which seamlessly integrate with Cloud Foundry. We will use a polyglot based microservice sample application (i.e. Java and .NET) together with Pivotal Apps Manager and Pivotal Cloud Foundry Metrics to illustrate how all these tools integrate and can be used in detecting and diagnosing a failing application.\n\nSpeakers:\nDave Tillman\nSoftware Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
