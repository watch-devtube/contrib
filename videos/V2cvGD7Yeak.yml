title: 'Opher Vishnia - Building a multiplayer game server and keeping (most of) your hair'
language: Spanish
recordingDate: 1501678759
description: "Opher is a multidisciplinary creator, invested in many different and often unrelated fields at the same time: computer science, art, music, design, math, game development and more.\n\nFor the past three years Opher has been working at Interlude as lead creative developer, and the go-to authority on client side web technologies. His day-to-day involves working with both creative teams (design, art, film) as well as development teams to push the envelope of interactive video, a new and exciting creative medium.\n\nTalk summary \n\nWhether it’s a first person shooter, real time strategy, action or physics based – making a game is the hardest software challenge you will ever undertake. That is – until you’ve decided to make it multiplayer.\n\nSo how do you create a server that runs a game, communicates with clients and compensates for lag? How do you make all your players feel like they’re playing the same game, at the same time, with each other (even though they actually don’t)?\n\nI will present the major challenges for enabling low-latency games on the web based on my experience developing Lance.gg, a Node.js game server. I’ll also talk about how to write efficient net code, optimize the data that goes over the wire and demystify scary terms like “client side prediction” and “entity interpolation/extrapolation”.\n\nBy the end of the talk, you’ll have a working multiplayer game that we can all play together!"
