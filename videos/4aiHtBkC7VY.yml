description: 'For those of us who aren''t code slingers, what''s the easiest way to create a digital book? There are a small but growing number of tools, ranging from big guns like those from Adobe to iPad-based efforts that aim to make publishing a touch and drag affair. Some of these solutions get you an iPad app, some get you EPUB, some are for web-based books. In this webcast series author and book futurist Pete Meyers looks at what''s best, what''s easiest to use, and what''s worth putting in your book-building toolkit.'
