description: "Intro: PM (Kubernetes) SIG – Stephen Augustus, Red Hat & Ihor Dvoretskyi, Cloud Native Computing Foundation \n\nKubernetes is one of the most high-velocity open source projects in the world, and one of the most unique features of this community project - that it has it's own PM team and PM process. SIG-PM, originally established as a Product Management Group, today covers multiple aspects of Product, Program and Project Management of Kubernetes. In this session, the SIG-PM co-chairs will provide a brief overview of SIG-PM history and basic principles, the areas of interaction with the Kubernetes community, together with the information on how to start contributing to Kubernetes as a PM. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Grbe"
