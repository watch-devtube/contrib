description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012.\nSpeaker: Oliver Gierke\nWhen applications grow bigger, modularity becomes a key aspect regarding maintainability. Design decisions made in the early days are hardly discoverable in the codebase, inter-module dependencies grow a lot. The talk introduces means and approaches to connect logical architecture to the codebase. Beyond that we discuss patterns and best practices around general code organization, package structures to build a solid foundation for Java applications and in how far Spring can help creating loosely coupled components and dedicated points to extend applications."
