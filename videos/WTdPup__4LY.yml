title: 'Sex Robots - Kate Devlin'
language: English
recordingDate: 1499244103
description: "People have created objects for sexual purposes since prehistoric times. Their form and function has changed as technology changes, from sex toys made of carved antler bone or stone to today’s humanlike proto-sex-robots.\n\nDespite this long history, the development of sex technology is far from straightforward. From legal and ethical issues to moral objections and funding problems, taboo frequently stifles innovation. In addition, the gender gap so prevalent in tech remains particularly entrenched, reinforcing stereotypes. This talk will consider the ways in which diversity and acceptance might be achieved in the development of sex technology, using the idea of the sex tech hackathon as an example of good practice."
