language: English
recordingDate: 1435590231
description: 'JavaScript is everywhere, but too often it''s locked in computers and phones. We need to bridge the gap between the physical world and your computer... It''s time to alter the world around us with JavaScript! In previous JSConf talks Jan Jongboom ripped mainboards out of phones; abused sensors; and juggled devices, but this session is going to be harder, deeper, higher and more crazy! How about procedural music generated by the sensor data of all members of the audience? Using bluetooth beacons to find out if the person next to you is worth talking to? Hardware hacking your Firefox OS phone to add more sensors? Geofencing your newborn with a phone mainboard? And all of that... with JavaScript! Loaded with demo''s this talk will forever change the way you think about JavaScript in the real world. LET''S DO THIS!'
