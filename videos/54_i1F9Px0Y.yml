description: "by Nicolas Chauvat\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.119/collab_cwldbe.webm\n\n\nThe Web of Data has become a reality over the past decade. But how do you browse all that data and how do you surf from one resource to the next by following the links in the datasets ? We will introduce the new CubicWeb, a Web Extension to make your favorite browser capable of handling RDF data so that you can surf the Semantic Web and chose how data is displayed and how you interact with it. The Web started as a set of linked documents written in HTML and displayed by\nhypertext browsers. With the dawn of the Web of data, the information exchanged\nbetween the server and the client can be encoded in a form that is directly machine\nprocessable instead of being embeded in text document for humans to interpret. \n\nWe asked ourselves what would be a browser for the Web of data, that would not\nbe limited to displaying documents and would allow its user to surf the gigantic\ngraph of linked data by displaying each piece of data with the best\nvisualization for the task at hand. \n\nWith this goal in mind, we reinstanciated the ideas developed more than ten\nyears ago for the user interface of the CubicWeb semantic web framework.  The\nresult is the CubicWeb Linked Data\nBrowser, a Web\nExtension for the main browsers\n(Firefox et Chrome) that can turn into HTML the RDF data sent by servers, with\nthe user choosing the best view among the ones she registered when configuring\nthe extension. \n\nNicolas Chauvat is the founder and CEO of Logilab, a company that has been since\nyear 2000 at the forefront of the Semantic Web in France. Logilab created the\nCubicWeb framework and used it for many applications, including the high-profile\ndata.bnf.fr and\nfrancearchives.fr. \n\nRoom: UD2.119\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 18:20:00+01"
