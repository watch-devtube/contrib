description: "Everything from the video: http://goo.gl/aXpXa\n\nIn this part of my Java video tutorial I focus on Java OOP Design Principles. We are still making the game we started , but now I'm creating all of the needed parts with strong use of encapsulation.\n\nI walk you through the think process of going from features needed to a finished UML class diagram. I know this is an odd way to talk about OOP design principles, but I wanted to present it in a new fresh way.\n\nWhat's better than making a game while learning OOP?"
