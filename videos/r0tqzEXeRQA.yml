recordingDate: 1463005812
description: "This session explores how Drupal service firms and agencies can weather challenging times by focusing on their core values and purpose.\n\nAs the Drupal project and community have grown and matured over the last few years, so has the expectation that companies in the Drupal business ecosystem will prioritize growth. However, growth in demand for Drupal services slowed in 2015 as many customers chose to wait for the impending release of Drupal 8. At the same time, industry consolidation and commoditization led to a downward pressure in rates for Drupal services. The result was a challenging year for many firms in the Drupal ecosystem. \n\nDuring challenging times, companies need to be able to articulate and focus on their core values, principles, and purpose. By focusing on long term goals and prioritizing them over short-term gains they’re better equipped to put employees and customers first and retain the flexibility needed to thrive in an ever-changing business landscape.\n\nIn this session, we’ll talk about:\nWhat values, principles, and purpose are and why they’re important to your company, especially during challenging times.\nHow to develop and articulate your company’s values, principles, and purpose.\nHow to ensure that your company's values are consistent with your culture.\nHow to inspire your team to thrive as part of a purpose-driven organization.\nThe goal will be to provide those who are involved in running Drupal service firms and agencies with the tools and perspective necessary to better understand not just the “what” and “how” of their business, but also the “why”."
