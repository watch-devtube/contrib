description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotai.io on April 25th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nFor travel e-business companies, recommender systems are paramount. There is an increasing need to take into account all the user information to tailor the best product proposition. One of them is the content that the user actually sees: the visual of the product. \n \nWhen it comes to hotels, some people can be more attracted by pictures of the room, the building or even the nearby beach.\n \nIn this talk, Pierre describes how he improved an e-business vacation retailer recommender system using the content of images. He explains how to leverage an open dataset and pre-trained deep learning models to derive user taste information.  This transfer learning approach enables companies to use state-of-the-art machine learning methods without having deep learning expertise."
