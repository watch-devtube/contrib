title: 'The Future of Databases and why Erlang might just be Central to It - Antony Falco'
language: English
recordingDate: 1400167352
description: "Five years ago, databases were, in the words of one venture capitalist, a \"solved problem.\"  Fast forward to today, and there are 30 databases in production somewhere that didn't exist before.  A quick survey shows that the JVM dominates this landscape.  However, there are trends developing that might change that - changes that will reshape the way applications are developed and deployed, changes that may very well see Erlang become a central player.\n\nTalk objectives:  Survey the current database landscape, identify the forces - technical, economic, social - that shaped it, look at the forces now developing that will shape the future tech environment, and point out where Erlang can play a critical role."
