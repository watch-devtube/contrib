recordingDate: 1433247824
description: "Debugging Java applications is comfortable and simple, but if you want to look beyond the Java horizon, you need special knowledge and and different tools. This interactive session shows you how to debug a running VM or analyze a VM core file with a native debugger. You will also learn how to use some of the more than 1,200 VM options to trace or modify the VM behavior. This knowledge can greatly help you identify, isolate, and reproduce the root cause of hard VM crashes, and it can also be pure fun to see which actual machine instruction the CPU is executing for your Java code.\n\n\nAuthor:\nVolker Simonis\nVolker Simonis works for SAP in the SAP JVM Technology group.
