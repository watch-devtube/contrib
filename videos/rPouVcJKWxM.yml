description: 'Playing around with serverless functions is quite different from building and running a serverless system in production. This presentation is based on a real-world project and deals with the topics of serverless architecture and deployment. It will take you on a journey that starts with a single Lambda function. By adding further serverless resources and services we will end up with a completely serverless platform. Furthermore we will round off the session by discussing alternative approaches and design decisions.'
