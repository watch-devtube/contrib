description: "Lessons learnt using Go - Lessons learnt using Go for a Native Cross - Platform OSS Project - Paul Bouwer\n\nGo is a statically typed and compiled language that feels very much like a dynamic language. It has a rich set of both core and third party libraries, and produces a single statically linked native binary for the Linux, OSX and Windows platforms.\nI'll walk through the decisions that led me to use Go for one of my cross platform OSS projects and the lessons I learnt along the way."
