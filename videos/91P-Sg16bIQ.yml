description: "What is the Bits-Service? - Steffen Uhlig & Peter Goetz, IBM\n\nDid you ever wonder what that mythical ‘bits-service’ incubation project is? Has the CloudFoundry community finally lost their minds and started on a competition with OpenStack Swift or Amazon S3? Hell NO! This talk will introduce the current state and give an outlook to the future of the bits-service project. \n\nIn short, the bits-service is an extraction of an existing functionality in the cloud controller today - externalising everything related to bits (application bits, droplets, packages, buildpacks, …) into a proper micro service. It can be scaled independently, is encapsulated by a well-defined API, so its a generic BLOBSTORE API, right? Mmm…. maybe come and join the team (the first community project equally staffed with engineers of IBM and Pivotal) in the talk and let us handle your bits!\n\nAbout Peter Goetz\nBluemix Software Developer, IBM\n\nAbout Steffen Uhlig\nSteffen is a software developer, Ruby enthusiast, husband and proud father of two sons. In reverse priority order. He works for IBM's Bluemix organization and currently serves as the team anchor for the CloudFoundry bits-service project."
