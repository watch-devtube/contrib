description: "Pre-Conference Special NorDevCon 27 February 2014 \n\nWhy wait for Java 8 when you have Groovy?\nwith Russel Winder. \n(@russel_winder)\n\nJava 8 is being eagerly touted as the future of JVM programming. It is indeed a massive revolution in Java despite being an incremental change. Java 8 will make all of Javas 1–7 completely dead languages. What is the single most important feature of Java 8? Lambda expressions. And yet all other JVM languages already have them: Kotlin, Ceylon, Clojure, JRuby, Jython, Scala, and (of course) Groovy.\n\nIn this session, we will investigate how you can have everything that Java 8 promises later in the year, today, using Groovy. On JDK6 and JDK7, as well as JDK8.\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/163007372/\n\nhttp://www.nordevcon.com/"
