title: 'What Haskell taught us when we were not looking! by Eric Torreborre'

description: "Haskell, the pure and lazy functional programming language, has now been around for more than 25 years. It had a profound influence on many other programming languages on the JVM: Java, Clojure and Scala.\n\nIn this talk you will discover which Haskell constructs have made it to the JVM ecosystem and change the way you program today. You will also get a glimpse of the features which are yet to be transferred for our greatest benefit. And we will finally try to answer the question: \"What do we, JVM programmers, have to teach Haskell?\"\n\nWarning: you might be tempted to try the real thing by yourself and become a Haskell programmer after this presentation!\n\nScala developer for Zalando based in Berlin, I love functional programming and maintain several Scala open-source libraries: specs2 for testing (http://specs2.org), eff for programming with effects (https://github.com/atnos-org/eff), grafter for dependency injection (https://github.com/zalando/grafter)."
