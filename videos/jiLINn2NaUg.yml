Be it the solution which a\nbank relies on for daily transactions or be the software which helps\nyour mobile operator track your usage and send you a bill. Every\napplication needs a data store and that is why every developer\nsooner or later has to be exposed to databases. I have seen mostly\nwhen I talk to developers about a database or relational database\nthere are a few or rather just a name that would pop-up in their head.\nProprietary databases have become so much a synonym to the term\n\"RDBMS\" that developer today hardly know about any other\ndatabase. In this talk I will discuss about 10 such great features which\nyour developers are missing if they are still stuck with Proprietary\nDatabase. I will be discussing 10 awesome features of PostgreSQLWorlds\nmost Advanced Open Source Database.\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCjc/"
