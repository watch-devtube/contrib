Learn how to make CSS do backflips to reproduce traditional animation techniques like walk cycles, scene transitions, and parallax. Save time and energy with conservative techniques like cut outs, pioneered by Japanese studios to accelerate the animation process. Understand the physics behind timing functions like ease-in to create subtle skeuomorphism. CSS animations and transitions are powerful new tools in the interactive design arsenal. With these babies at your command, all new possibilities for user experiences begin to unfold.\"\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
