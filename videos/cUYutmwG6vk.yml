recordingDate: 1413475204
description: "Originally recorded on June 6, 2014.  This webcast offers a case study on how to handle user authentication within Angular.JS. and will cover multiple aspects of the authentication flow, including:\n\n- Request/response interceptors to detect authentication failures at any point within the session\n- Local session storage on (certain) user data\n- Directive/Factory configuration\n\nThese steps will allow you to build a fully modular user authentication system, including logging in, limiting access for unauthorized users, and updating user profiles in a fast, efficient manner while still maintaining security and preventing unauthorized data from being accessed by any users.\n\nAbout Alex Vanston:\nAlex Vanston is a self-taught developer specializing in full-stack web development.
