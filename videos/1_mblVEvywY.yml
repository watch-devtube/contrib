description: "Lucidchart is a collaborative diagramming SaaS application. This session’s speakers have been transitioning from a monolithic CakePHP application to a services-oriented RESTful system based solely on Scala. They discuss their decision to ditch PHP and how they ended up with a working set of services. First, they explain their reasoning for switching languages, runtimes, and frameworks. Then they show how to create basic RESTful services in Scala and Play!, including backward-compatible, versioned API endpoints. And finally, they reveal their future plans to integrate further with Scala and Play!.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDerrick Isaacson\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Derrick Isaacson at https://www.parleys.com/author/derrick-isaacson\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
