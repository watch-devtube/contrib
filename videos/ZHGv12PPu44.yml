title: 'The Art of Parsing by Evgeny Mandrikov and Nicolas PERU'
language: English
recordingDate: 1492597158
description: "What attracts researchers starting from the 60s till nowadays? What is studied in university by engineers in computer science and then successfully forgotten? What is at the heart of the compilers used daily by any software developer? Parsers! From a practical point of view using a small pill of theory, this session will bring lights on questions like: if there is so many parser-generators based on formal theory, then why javac, GCC and Clang are all hand-written? And how we, insiders of the world of parsing, do this at SonarSource for languages like Java, C/C++, JavaScript, Python, COBOL?\n\nEvgeny Mandrikov \nSoftware Gardener, addicted to open source and code quality, hired by SonarSource after creation of improved open source analogs of their commercial products. Currently working as Language Team Technical Leader, responsible for development of source code analyzers for languages like Java, C/C++, C#, JavaScript, Python, COBOL, PL/SQL; implementator of cross project duplication detection. In a spare time working on other projects like for example JaCoCo, Eclipse EclEmma.\n\nNicolas PERU \nJava Developer, dad and doing some sports when I get the time, I have been developing with java for more than 10 years. After working in a few services company and in a private bank, I am now working at SonarSource for 3 years in the language team on the java plugin for SonarQube."
