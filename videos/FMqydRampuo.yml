description: "E. Dunham\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/15/\nRust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents \r\nsegfaults, and guarantees thread safety. If you ask users \"what's the catch\", \r\nthey'll tell you about the challenging learning curve that this powerful new\r\ntool requires. \r\n\r\nPresented by a Mozilla Research team member who works with the Rust language\r\nand with Servo (a browser engine written in Rust), this tutorial assumes \r\nfamiliarity with basic programming concepts (loops, conditionals, functions)\r\nbut will require no prior experience with strongly typed languages, Rust, or \r\nsystems programming. You'll learn the key concepts necessary for successful \r\nRust programming, as well as how to continue exploring the language after LCA."
