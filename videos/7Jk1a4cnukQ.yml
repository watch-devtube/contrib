description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nIn this presentation you will learn how to use the io2d 2D graphics library, which is soon to be available on vcpkg for Windows, OS X, iOS and Linux. The implementation contains several examples, including an Asteroids clone. We'll demonstrate the examples and their code in depth, show you how to write your own renderer, talk about the opportunities for casual graphics and teaching, and suggest some future directions.\n— \nGuy Davidson, Creative Assembly\nPrincipal Coding Manager\n\nPrincipal Coding Manager of Creative Assembly, makers of the Total War franchise, Alien:Isolation and the upcoming Halo Wars sequel, Guy has been writing games since the early 1980s. He is also a voting member of the ISO C++ committee, and a contributor to SG14, the study group devoted to low latency, real time requirements, and performance/efficiency especially for Games, Financial/Banking, and Simulations. He speaks at schools, colleges and universities about programming and likes to help good programmers become better programmers.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
