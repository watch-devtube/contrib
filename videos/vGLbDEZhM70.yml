There's just one thing in your way to building that perfect piece of software - you are lacking an eye for design. Debunking the myth that you need some magical \"feel\" or superpower to churn out good looking UIs, this lecture is a simple enough guide that could (and should) be practiced by anyone, regardless of the level of their design skills.\nWe will skip the boring theory and jump straight into the colors, alignments, sizes, fonts and animations. These are immediately applicable, track proven tips that will give your app that delightful experience that makes users say \"Oooh!\" and \"Wowz!\". So put your war face on and get ready to hack the design!"
