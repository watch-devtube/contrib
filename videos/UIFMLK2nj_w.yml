title: 'Second Order Optimization - The Math of Intelligence #2'
language: English
recordingDate: 1498230004
description: "Gradient Descent and its variants are very useful, but there exists an entire other class of optimization techniques that aren't as widely understood. We'll learn about second order method variants, how they compare to first order methods, and implement our own in Python.\n\nCode for this video (with challenge):\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Second_Order_Optimization_Newtons_Method\n\nAlberto's Winning Code:\nhttps://github.com/alberduris\n\nIvan's Runner up Code:\nhttps://github.com/PiaFraus\n\nPlease Subscribe!
