The best part is live instruction, with playback. But my favourite feature is viewing a previous class. Also, they are always there to answer questions, and prompt when you open an issue if you are having any trouble. Added bonus ~ you get lifetime access to the course you took!!! ~ This is the killer education app... I've take two courses, and I'm taking two more.”"
