description: "This is a story about how we struggled to implement strict latency requirements in a service implemented with Scala and Netty. And how we managed to do that.\n\nThe most common latency contributors are an in-process locking, thread scheduling, I/O, algorithmic inefficiencies and, of course, garbage collector.\n\nI will share our experience of dealing with the causes. And tell what you can do to prevent them from affecting the production."
