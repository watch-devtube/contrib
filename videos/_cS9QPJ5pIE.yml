language: English
recordingDate: 1384440280
description: "http://velocityconf.com\nMAX is well known for practicing and advocating Continuous Delivery, but it hasn't been a completely smooth journey. This talk will describe how we safely release to a production system processing $10 billion a day, confident that everything will be working when the markets open, and highlight some of the lessons we've learned along the way.\n\nSam Adams currently leads one of the development teams at LMAX Exchange. He has had an eclectic career to date: variously modelling the metabolism of drugs and food additives, creating tools to manage and mine scientific data, and now building a high performance exchange at one of the UK's fastest growing Tech Companies."
