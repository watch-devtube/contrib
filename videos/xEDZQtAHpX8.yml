title: 'Modern SQL: A lot has changed since SQL-92 by Markus Winand'
language: German
recordingDate: 1522160469
description: 'As a matter of fact, most textbooks, websites, and even universities teach SQL as it was 25 years ago (SQL-92). In the meantime, SQL evolved into a more modern data processing language that is not limited to relational algebra anymore. Although many databases support more modern SQL for years, hardly any developer knows how the new features can be used to solve common problems. This session is, therefore, not limited to explaining SQL features but also compares the SQL-92 solution to common problems to the more modern solution to make the benefit directly visible. Finally, the session also shows how long these features are supported by various databases so that you immediately know whether the shown solution works in your environment or not.'
