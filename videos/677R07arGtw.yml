Many pillars of successful quality strategies in the past arejust slowing down delivery too much. To be competitive in the future,we have to switch from quality as a cost centre to quality asvalue-add, but for that we have to completely change the way wemeasure, assure and define quality. This is a talk for anyone seriousabout software delivery, regardless of the role in their process."
