description: "Blockchain technology is hot right now! I've devised a 2 month study plan to help you learn how blockchains and cryptocurrency works. This is the kind of curriculum I'd create for myself to learn, but I'm open sourcing it for you guys since I love you. We'll start with cryptography, move on to Bitcoin, then Ethereum, other cryptos, and finally Decentralized Applications. \n\nCurriculum for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Blockchain_in_2_months\n\nPlease Subscribe!
