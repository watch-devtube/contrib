description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nProgramming is a creative endeavour by its very nature. What would happen if we turn our creative impulse towards a purely aesthetic goal? This is “creative coding” or “computer art”. I want to inspire programmers to explore the incredible possibilities afforded by combining their inherent creativity and problem solving skills with an appreciation of beauty and aesthetics.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers.org/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/wearedevs/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearedevelopers.org/"
