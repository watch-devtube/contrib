title: 'Fluent 2012: Gary Flake, "Bookmarklets as Applications"'
recordingDate: 1338502737
description: "Bookmarklets are both a blessing and a curse. They are inherently risky from a security perspective, but also offer the only cross-browser method for instantiating an application on top of another Web page. The core of our product (www.clipboard.com) is a bookmarklet that serves as a sort of cross-site copy buffer. It began as a hack but has evolved into an outright application framework that includes build and bootup processes, cross-site messaging, style sandboxing, and code reuse across multiple applications. This talk gives a world-wind tour of some of the best tricks that we've learned along the way.\n\nGary Flake\n\nClipboard Inc.\n\nDr. Gary William Flake is the CEO of Clipboard Inc., a seed stage Internet startup that allows users to save, organize and share their favorite parts of the web. Prior to founding Clipboard, Gary held executive positions at Microsoft, Yahoo!, and Overture, where he managed applied research teams, corporate-wide innovation efforts, and helped guide corporate strategy. Gary has filed over 150 patents and has numerous publications spanning over 20 years which have focused on machine learning, data mining, and complex systems. Gary has also appeared in leading national publications including The New York Times, The Washington Post, Time Magazine, Forbes Magazine, Nature Science, CNET News, Computer World, Fast Company, TechCrunch and Mashable, and has presented at leadership events such as the TED Conference. Gary earned his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Maryland and has served on numerous academic committees and university advisory boards.
