recordingDate: 1636122540
description: "Microservices can be hard; understanding container best practices can be hard as those practices are still being discovered. This session aids in minimizing the learning curve with container orchestration, specifically Kubernetes, by bringing DevOps best practices into the mix.\n\nThis is not another HelloWorld session with quick tips. Instead, you can expect a deep dive into how you can truly go from zero to DevOps superhero by simply selecting container tooling specifically built for simplifying the process. In doing so, you will also learn how these tools can provide better orchestration for cloud services, abstraction and encapsulation for your microservices deployments, and visibility into what runs where and why. You will not only walk away with a deeper understanding of this area, but also some hands-on material to help you get started.\n\nWatch thousands more tech talks in our SkillsCast library at https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts"
