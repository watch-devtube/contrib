Support the show by becoming a Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/funfunfunction\n\nI stay productive on my projects by defining a clear *desire* and *outcome*, and then habitually using the outcome to generate the *next task*. A sentence for each project that describes a falsifiable outcome, my desire behind that outcome, and the small next task in order to make progress towards that outcome.\n\n?
