description: "Yash Shah, LinkedIn\n\nSREs are software engineers with a broad skill set who work with systems in general. Depending on the type of work and teams, our usual time is spent in correlating incidental data to conclude the causes of issues. While we use ELK, Splunk etc. to visualize our logs; It’s an essential skill to parse log file by hand & visualize it to make useful observations quickly. Many times, we end up writing APIs & command line shortcuts to accelerate our debugging. We can make use of some of the techniques I’ll show to visualize these data quickly.\n\nData is in abundance. Where to focus requires sets of skills. Visualizing data is one of these essential skills.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Asia/Australia Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
