description: "Further information: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/17/session/mechanics-data-pipelines\n\nThis talk focused the topic on how to model data pipelines as retroactive, immutable data structures. It covers the topic of how do you build a data pipelines for a growing organization where different teams depend on each others data and need to be able to re-process data when errors occur upstream. I draw comparisons between the microservice architectures for both stream and batch processings and provide some guiding principals towards building resiliant systems based on experience scaling out infrastructure at SoundCloud.\n\nSpeaker:\nSean Braithwaite\nhttps://twitter.com/brapse"
