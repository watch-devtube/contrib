title: 'Fighting with Waste Driven Development: Lean Thinking (Lemi Orhan Ergin, Turkey)'
recordingDate: 1515768126
description: 'As developers, we often complain about the efficiency problems we face while working. We work hard but produce so little that our whole development life turns into a hamster wheel at some point. One of the biggest reason of such a common problem is working in waste. Waste is in everywhere, in our source code, in the office, in our processes and even in management. In this session, we will cover all technical aspects of software development, including code, tests, deployment strategies, coding standards, automization points, code comments, bug fixing procedures, living with technical debt, etc. I will talk about all the wastes we produce while developing software and how we can remove to make our development life leaner.'
