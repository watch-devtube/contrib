description: "Becoming Cloud Native Without Starting From Scratch - Marin Jankovski, GitLab \n\nFull rewrite of a working application is a luxury most companies can't afford. In this session, we will talk about how running GitLab architecture was adapted to be closer to a regular cloud native application without having to rewrite the whole application and disrupt ongoing product development. As an additional requirement, architecture had to be modeled on what is required for installation of GitLab.com scale (SaaS) while also keeping in mind on-premises installation customers which will use the same set of tools. We will discuss what parts of the application we left out of Kubernetes, how we loosely decoupled previously integrated components and how and why are we enforcing some old behaviours. We will share our experiences with using de-facto standard for distributing applications (Helm), but some mis-steps and some good choices we think we made. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrRC"
