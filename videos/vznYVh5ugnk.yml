description: "https://media.ccc.de/v/ASG2019-161-microcontroller-firmware-from-scratch\n\n\n\nFollow a journey of writing STM32 microcontroller firmware from scratch, using open-source tools.\n\nFollow Nikolay Kondrashov's journey of learning to write firmware for an STM32 microcontroller (the Blue Pill one) from scratch, using only open-source tools. From blinking LEDs, to controlling a toy car, without the complicated, and license-restricted manufacturer's libraries, or the comfortable crutches of the Arduino stack. Learn where to look for information, which tools you might need, and how to do it yourself with a similar or a different microcontroller.\n\nNikolai Kondrashov\n\nhttps://cfp.all-systems-go.io/ASG2019/talk/JDCVYP/"
