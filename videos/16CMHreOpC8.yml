title: 'About concurrency abstractions with Observable’s, Future’s, Akka in Scala (Jacek Laskowski, Poland)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1437561188
description: "The presentation is going to introduce you to the available concurrency abstractions available for Scala developers – Rx’s Observables, scala.concurrent. Future, and Akka’s actors. It’s going to be a Scala code-heavy presentation.\n\nHowever Scala is the language of choice the libraries are not limited to the Scala language and Java API is either the main research language with Scala’s as an alternative or yet another API."
