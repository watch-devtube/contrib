recordingDate: 1499088152
description: 'Jupyter notebooks are transforming the way we look at computing, coding and problem solving. But is this the only “data scientist experience” that this technology can provide? In this talk, Natalino will sketch how you could use Jupyter to create interactive and compelling data science web applications and provide new ways of data exploration and analysis. In the background, these apps are still powered by well understood and documented Jupyter notebooks.'
