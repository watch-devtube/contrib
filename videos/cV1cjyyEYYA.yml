title: 'Making machine learning accessible using Keras | Pavithra Vijay'
recordingDate: 1545383824
description: "Everyone should be able to start using AI to solve their business problems, to answer the questions they have, in much the same way that every business today has a webpage and can leverage the Internet for everything from sales to marketing to inventory sourcing. And we, as adopters of deep learning, have a responsibility to make sure that the opportunities that AI will create are open to everyone. Keras is a step in that direction. Keras makes the barrier to entry much lower to start using state-of-the-art deep learning models to solve real problems. It is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Keras was developed with a focus on user experience and fast experimentation. It offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear and actionable feedback upon user error.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
