title: 'YOW! Connected 2016 Andrew Spinks - Increasing The Confidence In Your Service Integrations'
recordingDate: 1485325080
description: "Testing mobile apps has always been difficult, especially across integration points. When a service has multiple clients, at multiple versions, it makes modifications incredibly difficult. Breakages between an app and service are often discovered late in the development cycle (or after it has been released!) and the causes are difficult to diagnose. Contract testing is an idea that has become very popular in the micro services area, but I believe is equally applicable to mobile applications.\n\nPact is a tool that was built to test the contracts between micro services. I built a Swift library that conforms to the same specification to allow the same testing methods to be used between an iOS mobile app and a service. With this talk I will show how you can use Pact to test the boundaries between your mobile app and services.\n\nAlthough the examples in this talk are Swift / iOS specific, the principles around contract testing and the use of Pact are applicable across client / server systems.\n\nAndy is passionate about finding better, more efficient ways of building and maintaining web and mobile application suites across many platforms.\n\nIn recent years, he has specialised in mobile development, a field whose rapid evolution always provides new opportunities and challenges.\n\nIn his 5 years at DiUS, Andy has worked on many successful tech projects through DiUS with clients such as ME Bank, MYOB and Australia Post. With a strong belief that the most successful and rewarding projects come when teams are given the autonomy, Andy is a passionate builder of highly functioning teams.\n\nWhen not doing the computer dance, he likes to seek fresh air away from the cityscape and go hiking, cycling or running.\n\nFor more on YOW!
