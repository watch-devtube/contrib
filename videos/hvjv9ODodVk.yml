description: "Process-as-Code: Real-World Examples that Scale\n\nMarco Morales, Senior Solutions Architect, Electric Cloud \n\n“Process-as-Code” allows you to define your software automation processes and delivery pipeline in code, including CI pipelines, Release Automation tasks, approval gates, and other activities. Process-as-Code enables your automation processes to have versions, support automated tests, and be defined in repeatable process with the same discipline as you would with product development. Additionally, Process-as-Code allows you to work with your team by collaborating and iterating on the development of your processes. In short, Process-as-Code is an effective way to rapidly onboard and scale your DevOps processes across large number of teams and applications.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to adopt Process-as-Code is writing these automation scripts using a Domain Specific Language (DSL). A DSL provides additional structure and ease-of-use, especially when you leverage a commonly available language. The alternative is a script that does not contain an intrinsic structure or model. In this talk, I'll show some common use cases that you’re probably familiar with in your own organization that are ideal for Process-as-Code and DSL use. I’ll decompose use cases into manageable pieces and design elegant, scalable solutions written in DSL. You can take advantage of these robust automations for your own pipelines, and scale them up as needed.\n\nThe real struggle with Process-as-Code is with automating complexity and scale – moving from simple one-off scripts, to those that can serve massive amounts of “things” (applications, flavors, servers, users, processes, coupled with dependencies, branching conditions, and more.). I’ll also provide key patterns and considerations for designing and implementing Process-as-Code for maximum re-use, flexibility, resiliency, and scale.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
