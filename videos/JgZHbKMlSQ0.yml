title: 'Edge Performance with In memory NoSQL by Liviu Costea'

description: "Everybody knows that accessing memory has lower latency than accessing the disk; so performance is the first thing that comes to mind when we talk about in-memory nosql. But there is another advantage of it and that is scalability. Autoscaling on aws can be reached using memcache, redis or aerospike\n\nWe are going to talk about in-memory NoSQL databases and how they can integrate in your current architecture in order to deliver high performance applications to your users. These can be used as session storage, a cache or a real database. They are also the key to having a scalable architecture and an easy way to reaching autoscaling. We will talk at least about Memcache (the veteran), Redis (the mature) and Aerospike (the new guy), see where each excels and how you can add them to your existing stack.\n\nLiviu Costea\nI am a software developer filing different positions throughout my career.\n\nSince 2010 I am the CTO of PlugAndTravel.com from Iasi, Romania, where we are building a next generation travel platform mainly targeting B2B customers.\n\nI like to read and write code and I try to engage myself in the local developer community being an active member and speaker at many user groups and conferences."
