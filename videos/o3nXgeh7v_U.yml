description: "Google Tech Talks\nJuly 24, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAccurate software clocks are essential for many aspects of networking, including both passive and active network measurement, real-time applications, and more generally, for tight distributed computation and service delivery. Best effort solutions using existing PC system clocks synchronised with the standard Network Time Protocol (NTP) algorithms are not robust enough, nor accurate enough for many purposes, whereas GPS based synchronisation is cash and effort intensive.\n\nThis talk will describe the TSCclock, a CPU oscillator based software clock with many intrinsic advantages, thanks to the high performance of modern off the shelf hardware. I will..."
