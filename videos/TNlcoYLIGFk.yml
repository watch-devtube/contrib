title: 'Headers for Hackers: Wrangling HTTP Like a Pro'
language: English
recordingDate: 1547318495
description: "HTTP has been gradually adding lots of new and exotic headers, and more are on the way. Learn about current best practices with Vary, Link, Content-Security-Policy, Referrer-Policy, Client-Hints, Clear-Site-Data and Alt-Svc, upcoming features such as Feature-Policy and proposals like Variants, Early-Hints and Origin-Policy. HTTP gives you incredibly powerful control over many aspects of the way a browser will process the page and is often a more effective or more secure option than trying to achieve the same effect with tags or script in the page.\n\nEVENT:\n\nÿredev 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAndrew Betts\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nÿredev Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
