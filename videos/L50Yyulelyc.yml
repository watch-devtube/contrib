description: "Tuning and Managing Loggregator, the Cloud Foundry Logging Subsystem - Allen Duet, Pivotal\n\nLoggregator is a differentiator for Cloud Foundry, allowing operators to easily aggregate logs from all running apps, along with metrics about the apps and the various Cloud Foundry components. However, there are subtleties in getting the most out of Loggregator. This talk will cover best practices in scaling and configuring Loggregator, what metrics to monitor from the Loggregator components to inform managing and tuning the configuration, and the various tools (nozzles, syslog drains, plugins) for getting the data into the logging system of the operator's choice, be it Splunk, ELK, Datadog, Papertrail or other solutions.\n\nAllen Duet\nI joined Pivotal in 2015 focused on Cloud Foundry and Logging and Metrics offerings surrounding Pivotal Cloud Foundry.  Prior to joining Pivotal I was the Chief Technology Officer at Swiftpage, where I transitioned two prominent CRM brands acquired from Sage Software to SaaS offerings (Act! and SalesLogix).  I have 17 years experience working with enterprise organizations implementing and operating critical software.  I'm passionate about machine learning and operationalizing predictive models and I've been working on ways to analyze logs from CF to detect future failure state.  I live in Denver Colorado and enjoy climbing, camping and fishing with my wife, daughter and friends."
