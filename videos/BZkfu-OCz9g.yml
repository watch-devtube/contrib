description: "\"Biological Modeling, Powered by AngularJS\"\n\nScalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a markup language that enables building two-dimensional vector graphics in the browser. Combining SVG and AngularJS can help you build very interesting models such as graphs, gauges and even more sophisticated graphics. In this session you will get to know what is SVG and how AngularJS and SVG can play together. You will also see an example of a genome viewer that was built using both SVG and AngularJS."
