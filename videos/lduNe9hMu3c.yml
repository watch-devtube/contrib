recordingDate: 1511886598
description: "DevOps In The Enterprise: The Analyst ‘Outside-In’ Perspective\n\nSam Fell, VP Marketing, Electric Cloud \nTorsten Volk, Managing Research Director for Hybrid Cloud, the Software Defined Data Center, Machine Learning and Cognitive Computing, EMA \nRobert E Stroud CGEIT CRIS, Principal Analyst, Forrester Research \n\nDevOps adoption is growing rapidly, especially in the enterprise. What started as a single DevOps initiative or grassroots movement is starting to propagate to many distributed teams. With no standard playbooks to follow, organizations often seek the advice of outside help – industry analysts – to navigate the transition as they break new ground on the path to DevOps at scale.\n\nJoin industry analysts from EMA, Forrester, and IDC to learn what they see as the driving forces of DevOps in 2017, and the forces shaping the industry in 2018. We’ll ask the analysts:\n\n- Is DevOps now mainstream? And what’s next?\n- What practices and technologies are expected to take hold in 2018?\n- How do microservices architectures impact the roles of Dev and Ops?\n- How do teams reconcile investments in ITIL, COBIT and PMI with DevOps?\n- How do teams hire, train and retain skilled DevOps staff.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
