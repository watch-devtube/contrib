description: "In the beginning was CVS. The light of Git shone and displaced the darkness. Except it didn't. Bad practices cast an evil shadow.\n\nAfter many wrong turns, we worked out 10 golden rules that made us fall in love with ... Git. At a German insurance company!\n\nDuring our talk, we will show you our simple configuration, the commands we needed to master (less than we thought) and how we integrated Git in our Scrum teams.\n\nWe will go over our 10 golden rules that you can apply to fall in love with Git all over again.\n\n# Sascha Binger\nSascha is a Git lover and Agile follower with a focus on helpful processes with Git. He is convinced that less is more! In the last 10 years he trained beginners in software development and helped to integrate Git and Maven in the daily business of an insurance company. He teaches Git, Maven, datastructures and algorithms. Actually he is Scrum Master and developer in a real Scrum Team!"
