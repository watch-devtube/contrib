description: "Supporting Multiple Major Versions of BOSH Releases with Concourse - Michael Lieser & Steffen Zuber, anynines\n\nEverybody knows that customers don’t all use the latest major release versions of software. Sometime the migration is too costly, sometimes it's another good reason. As a service provider, you can’t just stop supporting older versions and only focus on the latest.\n\nWhen it comes to shipping BOSH releases, how can you - with minimal effort - satisfy your customer by providing them with new features and bug fixes?\n\nThis talk will show how to use Concourse to monitor 3rd-party software to keep older major versions up-to-date, release your own bug fixes and features along the way. We will also present a git branching and versioning model to do it efficiently.\n\nAt the end of this talk, you'll feel an urge to download Concourse immediately to make your release management even easier.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRya/supporting-multiple-major-versions-of-bosh-releases-with-concourse-michael-lieser-steffen-zuber-anynines"
