description: "For the keynote presentation at the Northeast Scala Symposium, Daniel Spiewak delivers a thorough overview of the Cake Pattern. He begins with a general introduction and then delves into more esoteric details. The talk's main points include:\n\n-type theory\n-modules\n-pitfalls/ best practices to avoid mistakes\n-practical tips for everyday use \n\nDaniel argues that while most people think of the Cake Pattern as a tool for doing dependency injection, alluding to Jonas Boner's blog post, it can be used for so much more.\n\n** Visit our site for more content on Scala, including the rest of the presentations from NE Scala 2013: http://marakana.com/s/tags/scala"
