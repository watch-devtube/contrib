Apache Crunch is a simple framework on top of MapReduce - with support for running on Spark as well - which applies simple, typesafe, functional programming idioms to batch data processing pipelines to maximise developer productivity. With the addition of Java 8 and the upcoming crunch-lambda module, it is now simpler than ever to express your intent and get code working on your cluster quicker. This session will introduce the concepts behind Crunch, introduce the API, and provide practical examples of how it can be used to simplify your codebase and increase your productivity."
