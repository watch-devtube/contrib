description: "Speaker(s):\nDevon Carew, Sriram Saroop\n\nDescription:\nThe Chrome Apps platform is familiar (it's the web stack you know and love) and powerful (filesystems, cross-platform, hardware APIs, and more). We challenged ourselves to use all capabilities of the platform to build a developer editor for multi-device apps. How did we do? You'll have to stop by to find out :) In this session, you'll learn how to use Chrome Apps, Polymer, Dart, JavaScript, and the modern web to deliver great cross-platform apps. Along the way, we'll show you how we built Chrome Dev Editor and teach you valuable lessons learned that you can use in your next app.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
