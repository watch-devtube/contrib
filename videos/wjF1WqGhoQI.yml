title: 'Refactoring to Functional Style with Java 8'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474409431
description: "In Java we’ve programmed with the imperative style for a few decades. With Java 8, we can also code in functional style. This style has several benefits: code is concise, more expressive, easier to understand, and easier to change. But the transition from imperative to functional style is a hard journey. It’s not so much an issue of getting comfortable with the syntax; it’s the challenge of thinking functionally. What better way to learn that transition than taking imperative code and refactoring it to more of a functional style. This session starts with multiple code examples written in imperative style and shows how to approach and refactor them to functional style. You’ll learn about some APIs and hidden functions but more so what to look for during your own journey to functional style.\n\nBlog: https://blogs.oracle.com/java/refactoring-to-functional-style-with-java-8\n\n\nBelow is a breakdown of his presentation by topic:\n\n What is the functional style - https://youtu.be/wjF1WqGhoQI\n Exercise 1: is Prime - https://youtu.be/wjF1WqGhoQI?t=4m28s\n Exercise 2: Lines count - https://youtu.be/wjF1WqGhoQI?t=16m15s\n Exercise 3: Grouping - https://youtu.be/wjF1WqGhoQI?t=24m33s\n Exercise 4: Decorator - https://youtu.be/wjF1WqGhoQI?t=32m46s\n Exercise 5: Pythagoarean triples - https://youtu.be/wjF1WqGhoQI?t=44m52s\n Exercise 6: Sum of sqrt of k primes starting with n https://youtu.be/wjF1WqGhoQI?t=55m31s\n\nHis code samples are available at http://www.agiledeveloper.com/downloads.html"
