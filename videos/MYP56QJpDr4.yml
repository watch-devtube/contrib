description: "Join GitHub trainer and evangelist Tim Berglund for a look at Git, from the bits up. This talk is not for the Git beginner, but a more advanced look at \"weird internals stuff\" and obscure commands that will reveal a sort of internal API that is there for you to use and help expose you to certain intrinsic software design insights that can be had from looking at Git at this level.\n\n\"If you want to be that person on the team that's like the Git Weirdo...you're gonna need to know this stuff.\" - Tim Berglund"
