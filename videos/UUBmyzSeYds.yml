If you want to truly redefine the appearance of your button, you can specify a custom background. Instead of supplying a simple bitmap or color, however, your background should be a state list resource that changes appearance depending on the button's current state.\n\nYou can define the state list in an XML file that defines three different images or colors to use for the different button states.\n\nWatch the video to see how to implement it in your applications.\n\nWatch all videos of this series - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ooVrP1hQOGxsVIvgqd_TkPgDKQzhhO4\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nPlease write back to us at support@edureka.co or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information.\n\nhttp://www.edureka.co\n\nVisit - http://www.edureka.co/android-development-certification-course"
