description: "Use the Cluster API to Deploy Clusters On-Prem and in Public Clouds - Loc Nguyen, VMware & Kris Nova, Heptio \n\nDeploying and managing kubernetes clusters has a reputation filled with stress and headaches. On top of this, there are dozens of tools, APIs and services available to use but they don’t all interoperate. Some tools work best with on prem while others works best with a specific public cloud.  The Cluster API is a new project bringing in members from many of these well-known tools and members from both public clouds and on-prem infrastructure software providers. The goal is to create a common declarative, kubernetes-style API, tools, and best practices that can be used to create day-zero solutions for deploying kubernetes to multiple platforms. Come learn about the goals of this project and see a demo of it in use in both on-prem and in a public cloud. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrWT"
