description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nCharlie Hunt - Lead Author of Java Performance\n\nABSTRACT\nMost of the garbage collection performance and tuning information available on the Internet and periodical tends to be very specific to either a garbage collector, or specific to an application symptom. This presentation takes that myriad of information and boils it down to a set of fundamentals and principles. Coming to terms with these fundaments empowers folks to understand the consequences of making a choice of not only a garbage collector, but also garbage collection tuning choices. \n\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
