description: "Blender is a powerful and free 3D graphics tool used by artists and designers worldwide. But even experienced designers can find it challenging to turn an idea into a polished piece. Blender's new Cycles render features a powerful node-based editor for creating materials. Nodes are a highly customizable way to create a huge variety of materials but it can be daunting to take in at first.\n\nIn this hands-on webcast presented by Ben Simonds author of Blender Master Class, he will take you through creating various common material types with nodes for rendering in cycles. From there we will move on to creating more complex materials, incorporating different kinds of texture data and blending together different shader types.\n\nAbout Ben Simonds\n\nBen Simonds is a professional 3D artist and Co-Director of Gecko Animation Ltd, a post production and computer animation company based in London. Simond's popular Blender tutorials appear on his website (bensimonds.com), Blender Cookie, CG Cookie, and BlenderNation."
