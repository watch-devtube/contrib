description: 'Software developers spend most of their time working with code on literal level. Unfortunately, vast amount of design flaws hides behind hundreds of interrelated packages, classes and methods, destroying your system deliberately. Code structural analysis is a vital discipline for keeping application architecture in predictable and manageable state. In "Code Structural Analysis" Eduards will supply you with knowledge necessary to manage complexity of your logical design from theoretical, practical and tooling perspectives.'
