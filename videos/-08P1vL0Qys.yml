description: 'In less than two years Docker went from first line of code to major Open Source project with contributions from all the big names in IT. Everyone is excited, but what''s in for me - as a Dev or Ops? In short, Docker makes creating Development, Test and even Production environments an order of magnitude simpler, faster and completely portable across both local and cloud infrastructure. We will start from Docker main concepts: how to create a Linux Container from base images, run your application in it, and version your runtimes as you would with source code, and finish with a concrete example.'
