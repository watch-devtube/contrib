title: 'Democratizing Serverless: The New Open Source Fn Platform by Travis Reeder and Reed Allman'

description: "Serverless computing is one of the hottest trends in computing right now due to it’s simplicity and cost efficiency. But the most well-known serverless platforms are either proprietary or difficult to incorporate into existing platforms. Fortunately the open source Fn Project (fnproject.io) was recently launched and it enables you to run your own serverless infrastructure wherever you want—on your laptop or on the cloud with no vendor lock-in. Built on Docker, Fn includes support for writing functions in popular programming languages with excellent support for Java, local development with JUnit testing, and Fn Flow for orchestrating functions directly in Java. All you need is Docker and you're ready to go!\n\nFirst things first, we'll look at how to use the functions platform with a demo.\nWe’ll walk through writing functions in Go, Node.js, and Java and deploy them.\nThen we’ll discuss how the platform is implemented including packaging, input and output via STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR, the nitty gritty on running short-lived Docker containers and hot functions to increase performance.\nAnd finally we’ll talk about scaling functions.\n\n# Travis Reeder\nTravis is an Architect at Oracle building cutting edge cloud technology. He was previously co-founder and CTO of Iron.io, a pioneer in serverless computing, leading the architecture and engineering efforts. His 20 years of experience building high scale, big data applications, naturally drew him to cloud infrastructure.\n\n# Reed Allman \nReed has been working on building cloud infrastructure applications for the last 4 years, now for Oracle. He now has mixed feelings about saving the whale population, yet continues work in this field. Reed was previously at Iron.io, building out message queues and asynchronous processing systems before beginning work in the FaaS space. He is now working on building fn, a sync & async FaaS system, and looks forward to seeing developers do things with it that aren't chat bots."
