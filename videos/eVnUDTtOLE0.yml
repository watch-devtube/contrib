recordingDate: 1444725041
description: "Think of the humble pie chart. Simple and ubiquitous, yet surprisingly difficult to create with Web technologies in a flexible, maintainable way. Faced with this simple goal, Lea will take you on a colorful interactive journey through several aspects of CSS and SVG and will sweep you off your feet with clever ways to use them. At the end, you will have your pie and animate it too! Do not be fooled: the real takeaway of this talk has little to do with pie charts and a lot to do with problem solving via the tools the Open Web Platform offers us today.\n\nLea is a speaker, author of \"CSS Secrets\", and an Invited Expert in the CSS Working Group. She worked as a Developer Advocate for the W3C and is currently a Research Assistant at MIT.\n\nhttp://2015.cssconf.eu"
