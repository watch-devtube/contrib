title: 'Using AI to mine unstructured research papers to fight COVID-19'
language: English
recordingDate: 1589735703
description: "There is an overwhelming amount of information (and misinformation) about COVID-19. How can we use AI to better understand this disease? In this session, we take an open dataset of research papers on COVID-19 and apply several machine learning techniques (name entity recognition of medical terms, finding semantically similar words, contextual summarization, and knowledge graphs) which can help first responders and medical professionals better find and make sense of the research they need. We will dive into the techniques used and share code samples, so developers will walk away with the understanding of how to build a similar solution using Cognitive Search.\n\nThe AI Show's Favorite links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show   https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe\nCreate a Free account (Azure)  https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree"
