description: "Slides: https://speakerdeck.com/rauschma/the-four-layers-of-javascript-oop\n\nAxel's book: SpeakingJS.com\n\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript is complex. To make it easier to understand, this webcast explains it via four layers:\n\n1. Simple objects\n2. Prototype chains\n3. Constructors\n4. Inheritance between constructors\n\nEach new layer only depends on prior ones, enabling you to learn JavaScript OOP incrementally. Additionally, layers 1 and 2 form a simple core that you can refer back to whenever you are getting confused.\n\nDr. Axel Rauschmayer is a consultant and trainer for JavaScript, web technologies and information management. He has been programming since 1985, developing web applications since 1995 and held his first talk on Ajax in 2006. In 1999, he was technical manager at an internet startup that later expanded internationally. You can follow Axel on Twitter @rauschma\n\nDon't miss an upload!
