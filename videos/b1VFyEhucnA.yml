language: English
recordingDate: 1499244376
description: "Cosmos DB is a high-availability, geo-scale NoSQL database service running on the Microsoft Azure cloud. It supports 10 millisecond reads and 15 millisecond writes on JSON data across 38+ data centers around the world, at a 99.99% SLA. Horizontal scalability is virtually unlimited via built-in support for data partitioning, configurable consistency levels, and one-click geo-replication. Cosmos DB supports common database concepts like SQL and LINQ syntax, stored procedures and triggers, and change notification, and has support for Java, .NET, Node.js, and Python via platform-specific SDKs, as well as general-purpose clients via a full-featured REST API. Best of all, Cosmos DB is a hosted cloud service that eliminates the need to manage infrastructure on your own. You focus on your data and your application!\n\nIn this presentation we'll discuss the major features of Cosmos DB and demonstrate several key capabilities like MongoDB protocol compatibility, SQL query support, graph-oriented queries with the Gremlin query language, single-click geo-replication, and language SDK support for ASP.NET and similar platforms."
