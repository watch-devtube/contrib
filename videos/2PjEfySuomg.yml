description: "There needs to be a bridge between the centralized Web and the decentralized Web. In this video, i'll talk about a protocol called Essentia. It acts as a gateway between both worlds, connecting apps, dApps, assets, devices, storage etc. into one easy interface. Its a great example of this and i'll also discuss multi-signature transactions, cross atomic swaps, and some other blockchain related techniques using code. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Decentralized_Gateways\n\nPlease Subscribe!
