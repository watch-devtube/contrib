description: "Languages in the ML family are great for writing domain-specific languages (DSL)s. We can use ideas from programming language theory (PLT) to make our DSLs more powerful, and we can use tools from the Haskell ecosystem to make our implementation easier to write, test, maintain and change.\n\nThis will be a lightning tour of how to build up a DSL that will get progressively more advanced throughout the talk. We’ll be exploring ways to keep the results testable (via QuickCheck) and composable along the way.\n\nThe first thing we’ll look at is operational semantics. We’ll specify the semantics of our DSL, implement the semantic rules in Haskell, and use that to derive an evaluator for our DSL. This in turns leads to a discussion of type systems. Some DSL programs can get stuck during evaluation, and type system can be used to check that a DSL program won’t get stuck.\n\nHaving both the semantic and type system specified also provides some opportunities for testing, and we can bias our implementation in order to do this in a way that will boost our confidence in the resulting DSL.\n\nThe next piece of the puzzle we will look at s parsing and pretty printing the DSL. Most importantly, we’ll cover the use of trifecta for parsing. This provides support for very good error messages, both in the parsing stage and in the type checking stage.\n\nThe last thing we’ll look at is lambda calculus, and how to embed lambda calculus into our DSL. This is a big step forward since it allows users of the DSL to abstract and reuse fragments of DSL programs. The implementation will be greatly assisted by the use of the bound library.\n\nThe remainder of the talk will be discussing various extensions and improvements that are either very useful or quite exciting.\n\nThe material will eventually appear in much more detail on http://dlaing.org. Most of the PLT material is covered in Pierce’s “Types and Programming Languages” and Harper’s “Practical Foundations of Programming Languages”.\n\nDave had programmed in a handful of mainstream languages for years and years. He came across Haskell along the way and made the decision to dive in. This has been followed by a lot of code, a handful of talks, and haranguing people to read various textbooks.\n\nSo, you’ve written a DSL, it’s a work of art! It so perfectly models the problem at hand that even a trained house cat could generate business value. You just have one problem, your interpreter runs 100 times slower than a shell script launching JVMs in a loop.\n\nDomain specific languages (DSLs) are able to offer the abstraction benefits of a high-level language, while when compiled, competing with low-level languages on performance. Because DSLs have a much smaller problem area, many specialised optimisations can be performed which are not feasible for a general purpose language.\n\nIn this talk, we will explain a number of optimisations which are useful for DSLs, and show our solutions to the practical issues we faced when implementing them in our query language, Icicle.\n\nIcicle is a query language for processing large amounts of time-series data. Its type system enforces that queries require only a single pass over the data, and that multiple queries over the same data can be fused together. By using a combination of high level optimisations such as partial evaluation and common subexpression elimination, and low level optimisations such as parsing code which is specialised for the given input, our queries are faster than the equivalent hand-written C code.\n\nFrom this talk, the audience will learn how the focused point of view that DSLs provide can be useful in performance critical systems, as well as a number of concrete techniques for optimising their own DSLs.\n\nTarget:\n\nAnyone who is interested in domain specific languages (DSLs), embedded or external, and wants to know how to make them beat the pants off hand written C/C++.\n\nThe techniques presented are applicable to DSLs written in any language, although a familiarity with Haskell syntax would be a plus.\n\nJacob works at Ambiata, implementing the compiler and surrounding ecosystem for Icicle, a query language for processing large amounts of time-series data. His passion is building correct high performance software and he thinks functional programming and domain specific languages are outstanding tools for this purpose.\n\nFor more on YOW!
