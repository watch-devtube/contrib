description: "Blockchain enables us to connect business owners and investors directly together. We're building the world's first digitised share certificate using blockchain which we expect to become the new global standard. But how do we handle public data (eg shareholder name) and private data (eg date of birth) within blockchain and maintain decentralisation? Ermin Dzinic explains it all in this session.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
