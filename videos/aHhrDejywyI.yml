description: "Microservices are the new black.\n\nYou've heard about them, you've read about them, you may have even implemented a few, but sooner or later you'll run into the age-old conundrum: How do I break my monolith apart? Where do I draw service boundaries?\n\nIn this talk you will learn several widely-applicable strategies for decomposing your monolithic application, along with their respective risks and the appropriate mitigation strategies.\nThese techniques are widely used at Wix, took us a long time to develop, and have proven consistently effective; hopefully they will help you avoid the same battle scars."
