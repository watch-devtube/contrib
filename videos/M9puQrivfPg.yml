title: 'Beyond Web 2.0: Django and Python in the Modern Web Ecosystem'
language: English
recordingDate: 1520872200
description: "Web frameworks like Django emerged in the world of \"Web 2.0\". That was over 10 years old; and the web that it was built for doesn't really exist any more. Yes, we still need to rapidly develop database-backed, AJAX-enabled websites, but the modern web is faced with new problems and new challenges. Many of those challenges involve interacting with devices that aren't desktop machines, and platforms that aren't a traditional browser. And user expectations of the level of interactivity of modern websites has dramatically increased.\n\nThe most popular approaches to addressing this change have been to adopt Javascript across the board. Does this mean we have to abandon Django and Python? Can we keep using Python and Django on the server side and interact with independent client side frameworks? Or can we push Python and Django into these new environments?\n\nIn this talk, Dr Russell Keith-Magee will explore the problems, and the potential solutions, to these problems.\n\nEVENT:\n\nThis talk was given at Linux.conf.au 2018 (LCA2018) which was held on 22-26 January 2018 in Sydney Australia.\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRussell Keith-Magee\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikziAtBxow"
