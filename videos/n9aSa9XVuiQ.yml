description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nHans Wennborg - Developer at the Chromium Browser Project\n\nABSTRACT\nClang is a new and exciting compiler for C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++. Chromium is the open-source project that Google Chrome is based on. For the past three years, we have been putting Clang to use in Chromium as a means of improving developer productivity, finding bugs, enforcing style, doing large-scale refactorings, and more.\n\nThis talk is about how you can benefit from using a modern, hackable, open-source compiler in your project, and why you should be excited about it. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
