description: 'Roughly 1 in 5 people around the world live with a disability, and in the United States alone people with disabilities control $175 billion in discretionary income. Unfortunately, many sites and apps on the web can be near-impossible to use, even with assistive technology. Payment flows are generally designed to be usable, with minimal steps and clear directions, because it''s known that that increases conversion and purchases. At the same time, though, many of the same flows neglect accessibility concerns and make it difficult for a significant portion of the population to buy. In this talk, I''ll discuss the basics of web accessibility, reveal accessibility mistakes that are common on payment forms and in payment flows, and give you some practical tips on how to improve the payment experience for your own users.'
