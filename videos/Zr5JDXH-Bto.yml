description: "The Google LAX office hosted the CEO and Co-Director of MEET (Middle East Education through Technology), Noa Epstein on 2012/11/06.\n\nFounded in 2004 by a Googler and a team of Palestinians and Israelis, MEET is a program that is using technology and business to educate and empower tomorrow's most promising Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Each year MEET brings together hundreds of excelling Palestinian and Israeli young leaders to study technology, business, and entrepreneurship and together launch awesome technology products that transcend borders. MEET works in partnership with MIT and holds its program in Jerusalem. Find out more at http://meet.mit.edu/\n\nTens of Googlers both in the Middle East and the United States have participated in the program as instructors and mentors to the students, helping them launch inspiring projects such as a mobile app that helps to mobilize collective action, a Codecademy-like site focused on youth in the Middle East, and a gesture-controlled technology. Join us to learn more about this great initiative and how you can get involved!\n\nThe embedded video prepared by MEET students may also be found at http://youtu.be/jCrSQgFOL-E"
