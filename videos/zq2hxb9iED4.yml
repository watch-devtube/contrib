description: "As PayPal has journeyed to a cloud-native environment, Shaun has led the Node.js Docker effort in revamping the deployment architecture for all applications built on Node.js. Using Docker allows for immutable, composable Node.js deployments in a nice declarative fashion. In this session, we'll cover Docker image best practices, container startup, and process management, signal handling for graceful shutdowns, injecting environment variables and mounting files as well as new ways to version dependencies across environments to better Node.js build and deployments.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode+JS Interactive 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nShaun Warman, PayPal\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2a1mNr0kF0"
