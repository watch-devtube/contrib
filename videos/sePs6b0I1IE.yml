description: "You most likely write .NET code. Or Javascript. Do you even wonder how your machine “understands it”? You’re probably aware that it runs on VM, but what lies beneath it? We need to go deeper!\n\nIn this talk, we’ll look into x86 architecture, go all the way down to 0s and 1s and try to write some code on each level. If you know what is EAX, what INC does and know what pointers are, there may be nothing new in this talk for you, but you may enjoy refreshing the old days. If you have been writing Javascript whole your life, but you are interested what runs on “the metal”, you will like it.\n\nI want to write code on each level, starting from the assembly, and showing how you can call lower code from higher abstractions and how things stack together in computers.\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl) \n13-15 September 2017"
