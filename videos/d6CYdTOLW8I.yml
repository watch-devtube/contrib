description: "? Registration to DevTernity is running! https://devternity.com\n\n#closingkeynote #simpledesign #bestpractices\n\nComplexity hurts. We find it everywhere, in our daily lives, in products, and in the code we have to maintain as developers. Complexity comes in different forms and flavors. The ways in which complexity can manifest is, well, complex. In this keynote, an award winning author and software practitioner will share experiences and observations from working on multiple software projects, about what leads to complexities, the traps developers and organizations fall into, and what we can do to effectively deal with these common, recurring issues we see across domains and products."
