description: "Everyone fails. In this video, i'll recount 5 times in my life where I failed and talk about how I recovered. Whether it be in work life, school life, or personal life, failure is just a reality of life. Its how you deal with it that defines your future. If you're wondering, I recorded this is Lisbon Portugal since I was invited to speak at a Data Science meetup about blockchain AI. I took this is my airbnb when i had some free time. \n\nHammad's Winning Code:\nhttps://github.com/hammadshaikhha/Math-of-Machine-Learning-Course-by-Siraj/blob/master/Binary%20Logistic%20Regression/Binary%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb\n\nWladi's Runner up code: \nhttps://github.com/wladiarce/logistic_regression_numpy\n\nPlease Subscribe!
