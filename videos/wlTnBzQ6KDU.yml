description: "Speaker: Costin Leau\nPart of the Spring Data umbrella, Spring for Apache Hadoop provides support for developing applications based on Apache Hadoop technologies by leveraging the capabilities of the Spring ecosystem. Whether one is writing stand-alone, vanilla MapReduce applications, interacting with data from multiple data stores across the enterprise, or coordinating a complex workflow of HDFS, Pig, or Hive jobs, or anything in between, Spring for Apache Hadoop stays true to the Spring philosophy offering a simplified programming model and addresses \"accidental complexity\" caused by the infrastructure. Spring for Apache Hadoop, provides a powerful tool in the developer arsenal for dealing with big data volumes."
