How does Stream processing and data partitioning work? How does the cluster recover when a Spring XD container goes down? How does Spring XD create and manage application contexts? What is a Plugin? How does Spring XD support extensibility? Our experienced guides will take you on a tour of the Spring XD runtime environment, navigating Streams and observing how Modules thrive in their natural habitat. We will explore the role of ZooKeeper, Spring Integration, and Spring Boot through beautiful panoramas, code samples, and daring demonstrations."
