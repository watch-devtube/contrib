title: 'My adventures building hamlib support for the OpenSDR board'
recordingDate: 1484803173
description: "Paul Warren\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/119/\nThis talk will explore the path I went on building Hamlib support for the Open Software Defined Radio board, previously built at the LCA2015 OpenRadio MiniConf.\r\n\r\nI'll detail my mistakes, where I ended up, and future plans.\r\n\r\nHamlib is an abstraction layer to allow applications to easily talk to various radio hardware, usually over a serial connection.\r\n\r\nThe Open SDR board is a fully open sourced SDR baord that receives across the HF band (0-30MHz) with the help of a sound card. It can also trasmit PSK31 a text based communication mode."
