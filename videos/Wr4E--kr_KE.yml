description: "Chaos Heidi vs. Orchard: Self-Disruption and Healing in a Cloud Foundry-Based Service Environment - Diego Zamboni, Swisscom & Bill Chapman, Stark & Wayne\n\nCloud Foundry has built-in health management and self-healing capabilities. But when delivering a Cloud Foundry-based service, it is not sufficient to monitor and heal the Cloud Foundry components, since the end-to-end functionality of the service also depends on the state of the entire infrastructure surrounding and supporting Cloud Foundry. This includes the hardware, virtualization and networking platforms on which it runs, the CF Services available, the user interface, and even the billing systems. \n\nTo this effect, at Swisscom we have built an overarching Health Management platform called Orchard, which not only monitors and notifies about failures in our Application Cloud platform, but has the ability to trigger automated responses to heal those failures automatically. To challenge Orchard’s abilities, we have also developed Chaos Heidi, a self-disruption platform that allows us to cause failure scenarios of different types. \n\nIn this talk we will describe Orchard and Chaos Heidi, including their motivation and architecture, their current implementations, and our challenges and ideas for the future. \n\nBill Chapman\nCloud Architect, Stark and Wayne\nBill is a Cloud Architect at Stark & Wayne and for the last two years he has been helping Swisscom in their efforts to build management and monitoring tools that support their Cloud Foundry deployments. Before coming to Stark & Wayne Bill spent several years as a consultant, and development manager helping businesses scale both their software stacks and their engineering teams.\n\nDiego Zamboni\nCloud Architect, Swisscom\nDiego Zamboni is a computer scientist, consultant, author, programmer and sysadmin who works as a Cloud Architect at Swisscom, where he is building monitoring and self-healing capabilities into Swisscom’s Cloud Infrastructure. He has more than 20 years of experience in system administration and security, and has worked in both the applied and theoretical sides of the computer science field. He holds a Ph.D. from Purdue University, has worked a sysadmin at a supercomputer center, as a researcher at the IBM Zurich Research Lab, as a consultant at HP Enterprise Services and as a Product Manager at CFEngine. He is the author of the book \"Learning CFEngine 3\", published by O'Reilly Media. He lives in Switzerland with his wife and two daughters."
