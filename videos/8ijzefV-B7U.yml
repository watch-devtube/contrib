title: 'GoGaRuCo 2014- Taking over Someone Else''s Open-Source Projects'
recordingDate: 1412361722
description: "By, Daniel Doubrovkine\nOver the past years I've created numerous open-source libraries, but my biggest and most popular open-source Ruby projects aren't my own. Three years ago I took over Grape and more recently Hashie Hashie. Both are very important to the community and used by thousands of projects.\n\nTaking over someone else's project without just forking it away is both a commitment and a challenge. It's often ungrateful work, but it's really important. In this talk I'll give some history, motivations and practical tools of how to do it. What do to when maintainers go MIA, and more.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FUGU/"
