description: "Sensor networks are the way to go if you have to monitor environmental data such as temperature in a wide area. Usually you need some infrastructure, including servers for communication, data storage, and the like and to manage the network and make the sensor data available. This session shows how you could build a sensor network, including the infrastructure, based on embedded devices only. It uses several embedded devices such as a Raspberry Pi, a BeagleBone Black, a Cubieboard2, and an i.MX6-based Cubox-i. The idea is to use cheap standard devices in combination with Java technology to realize a sensor network. In addition, it shows mobile clients, such as a smartwatch, for visualizing the sensor network data.\n\n\nAuthor:\nGerrit Grunwald\nGerrit Grunwald is working as a software engineer at Canoo Engineering AG (Basel, Switzerland). He is responsible for visualizations of all kinds. His technical interests include Java desktop software development and specifically the subareas - JavaFX, Java Swing and HTML5 controls.\nHe‘s a decent frequent blogger, founder and leader of the Java User Group in Münster (Germany), where he‘s also living.\nHe has been involved in the IT industry since 1996, when he started studying Applied Physics at the University of Applied Sciences Münster (Germany).\nView more trainings by Gerrit Grunwald at https://www.parleys.com/author/gerrit-grunwald\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
