description: "Tim Saxe & Brian Faith\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/110/\n\nThis talk will take you on our journey from resistance to adoption of something unthinkable - An FPGA company adopting Open Source FPGA Tooling.\r\n\r\nWe are at a tipping point in the semiconductor industry.  Companies are demonstrating that you can build a successful business model based on open source; just look at the accelerating adoption rate that RISC-V ISA is seeing in the processor space.  And yet this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of how disruptive open source hardware can become to the semiconductor industry.  \r\n\r\nSince the inception of our industry, the vendor-supported FPGA development tools have been proprietary and closed source. Initially this was simply because that is the way things were done – there were no open standards. But over time, keeping them closed and proprietary enabled a level of influence and control over users. If a designer liked your software, they tended not to change, and that implicitly makes your user base captive.\r\n\r\nOpen source FPGA tools have been around for a long time, being used primarily by hobbyists and in academia. Over the past few years, this situation has evolved, with an increasing number of new developers with software backgrounds gravitating towards open source FPGA development tools, including design teams at some of the largest companies in the electronics industry.\r\n\r\nSo, why do FPGA companies still resist them? \r\n\r\nNot Invented Here? Fear? Control?\r\n\r\nThis talk will serve two purposes:\r\n1. To show how one company is building its future on top of open source FPGA tools\r\n2. To share how we arrived at our decision in the hope that others will soon take the same leap.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
