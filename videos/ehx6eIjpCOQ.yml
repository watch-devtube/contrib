description: "\"Firing People\"\n\nPeople don’t talk about getting fired. We come up with euphemisms: “I’m funemployed!”, or “I’m looking for my next journey!” That’s strange, when you think about it, given that it’s a fairly normal event that happens from time to time. But mostly it’s tragic, because unless we start talking about firing and getting fired, we can’t begin to start improving this very real—and often very painful—process."
