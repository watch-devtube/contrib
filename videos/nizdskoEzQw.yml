title: 'RISC-V Software and Firmware Development in the Cloud Using OpenPiton+Ariane on Amazon F1'
language: English
recordingDate: 1598166255
description: "by David Wentzlaff and Jonathan Balkind\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/K.3.401/riscv_openpiton.webm\n\nRISC-V application, OS, and firmware development has been slowed by the lack of \"real hardware\" available for developers to work with. With the rise of FPGAs in the cloud and the recent release of the OpenPiton+Ariane manycore platform on Amazon's F1 cloud FPGA platform, we propose using 1-12 core OpenPiton+Ariane processors emulated on F1 to develop RISC-V software and firmware. In this talk, we will give an accelerated tutorial on how to get started with OpenPiton+Ariane, the spec-compliant RISC-V platform it offers, and how the firmware and OS can be modified and run on top. We will show a number of applications built and running for our present Debian distribution and the software development environment that this offers. We will then highlight how hardware and software can be co-designed on OpenPiton+Ariane with the ability to recompile the hardware underlying the cloud FPGA image and deploy it for use by others. This platform is serving as a basis for software and hardware development for the DECADES project, a project investigating heterogenous manycore and hardware accelerator based designs with support for orchestrated data movement.\nRISC-V Software and Firmware Development in the Cloud Using OpenPiton+Ariane on Amazon F1\n\n\nRISC-V application, OS, and firmware development has been slowed by the lack of \"real hardware\" available for developers to work with.
