title: 'Reaktor Talks: Juho Teperi, Using JS components vs. Writing Reagent components'
recordingDate: 1490018179
description: "JavaScript and React ecosystems provide huge amount of ready-for-use UI components. How easy it is to use these from ClojureScript? Is it worth re-implementing these in Cljs + Reagent, what are the trade-offs?\n\nThis talk demonstrates both how to use existing JS libraries (through Cljsjs) and the Reagent components we have written and use extensively in our projects. As subplot, our clj-suomi library is used to provide example data."
