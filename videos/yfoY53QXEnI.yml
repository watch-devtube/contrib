description: "In this video I will cram as much as possible about CSS. We will be looking at styles, selectors, declarations, etc. We will build a CSS cheat sheet that you can keep as a resource and we will also create a basic website layout. We are using CSS3 but mostly the basics. I will be creating an advanced CSS course with animations,  etc. I do have a Flexbox in 20 minutes video as well if you want to learn flexbox.\n\nCODE: Code for this video\nhttp://www.traversymedia.com/downloads/csscrashcourse.zip\n\nHTML CRASH COURSE VIDEO:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE\n\nBECOME A PATRON: Support me directly for even $1 per month\nhttp://www.patreon.com/traversymedia\nONE TIME DONATIONS:\nhttp://www.paypal.me/traversymedia\n\nFOLLOW TRAVERSY MEDIA:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/traversymedia\nhttp://www.twitter.com/traversymedia\nhttp://www.instagram.com/traversymedia"
