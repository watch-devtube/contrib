description: "Usually, when you make changes to code you need to imagine what this code will do, how your components will look like and how colors fit. But you've got a computer for that!\n\nI will show you how immediate feedback on your changes to JavaScript, HTML or CSS code helps to be more productive, inspire yourself and catch new ideas. In my opinion, this is definitely going to be the next best practice in Web development.\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
