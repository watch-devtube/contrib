description: "All neural networks use activation functions, but the reasons behind using them are never clear! Let's discuss what activation functions are, when they should be used, and what the difference between them is.\n\nSample code from this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Which-Activation-Function-Should-I-Use\n\nPlease subscribe!
