description: "Google Tech Talk\nDecember 3, 2009\n\nABSTRACT\n\nPresented by Luis Aguirre-Torres.\n\nLatin America, which currently accounts for one fifth of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions, represents a great opportunity for investors and cleantech firms alike. The new trend towards incorporating renewable energy in the energy portfolio in most developing countries, in combination with international pressure to actively participate in the development and execution of a new global climate deal, make cleantech one of the largest business opportunities in Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Argentina among other Latin American countries. In recent months, Mexico published a new renewable energy program, focused on further developing the renewable energy and biofuel industry; in Brazil, the government is one of the most active participants in the end-of-the-year climate negotiations, and leads the rest of the Latin American countries in wind and biofuel developments. On the other hand, Chile, as well as Bolivia, have uncovered a great opportunity in the countries salt flatlands where Lithium can be found as a valuable natural resource necessary in the development of hybrid and electric vehicle batteries. Argentina, Colombia and Peru have turned their eyes to the biodiesel and second-generation biofuel market.\n\nLatin America, which currently accounts for one fifth of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions, represents a great opportunity for investors and cleantech firms alike.
