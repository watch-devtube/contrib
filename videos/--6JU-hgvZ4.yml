description: "Building distributed systems is notoriously hard... building a distributed team, even more so. At Elastic — the company behind the open source tools Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash — everything is distributed; the company and our products. This talk dives into the details of how Elastic is thriving on its distributed model:\n\nHow Elastic started to be distributed by design.\nWhat our shared values are and what we have learned as we progressed and grew to our current size.\nWhat the day of an Elastician can look like.\nWhat we are using in terms of tooling.\nHow we hire and onboard new employees."
