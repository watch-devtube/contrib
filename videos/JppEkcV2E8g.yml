description: "Many people underestimate the paradigm shift that is inherent with running applications in the cloud rather than on-premise. Truly cloud-native applications on Java EE are possible, with very little effort, but a shift in mindset is required to really take advantage of the scale that comes with cloud deployments.\n\nIn this talk, I will demonstrate the use of various tools like Docker, Vagrant and Amazon Web Services to run Java EE applications on Payara Micro in the cloud, demonstrating elasticity and resilience, making use of features that are not easy or not feasible with on-premise deployments."
