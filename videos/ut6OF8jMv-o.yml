language: English
recordingDate: 1527201000
description: "Last year V8 launched Ignition and Turbofan, the new compiler pipeline that handles all JavaScript code generation. Previously, achieving high-performance in Node.js meant catering to the oddities of our now-deprecated Crankshaft compiler. This talk covers our new code-generation architecture - what makes it special, a bit about how it works, and how to write high performance code for the new V8 pipeline. \n\nEVENT:\n\nNodeJS Interactive 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPeter Marshall, Google\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqOhBezMx1o"
