description: "Betting on DevOps: How NetEnt Transforms Online Gaming Delivery\n\nAloisio Rocha, Agile Product Owner, NetEnt \n\nNetEnt (NASDAQ OMX Net-B) is a pioneer in online gaming, entertaining the world for the past 20 years. Our innovative platform provides premium online and mobile gaming solutions to some of the world’s largest online casino operators in over 40 countries, handling more than 35 billion gaming transactions per year.\n\nOur Dev organization started on a journey of Continuous Delivery, creating strains on our Ops teams, who were having difficulties keeping up with the pace of updates produced. \n\nAs the number of games and operators in our portfolio grew, we had to rethink our delivery pipeline to allow us to accelerate our releases as well as scale our operations to support the increased load and complexity of our backend apps as well.\n\nNot to be outdone by Dev, our Ops teams decided to race them to the middle! (we’re big into gaming, here). We announced “Project TTM” – taking an “Ops-first” approach to our DevOps transformation, with an aggressive goal of cutting deployment time of new apps over the whole customer base from 6 months to 2 weeks, as well as accelerating and streamlining the onboarding of new customers - within less than a year. And we did even better than we expected!\n\nIn this talk, I would share the 4 key tenets and critical paths for our “Ops-first” approach to DevOps, and some of the patterns we used to scale our adoption so quickly – through QA, deployments, App management, and more.\n\nAt NetEnt we show that when you bet on DevOps, Red (Dev) and Black (Ops) both win, and – of course – the house!\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
