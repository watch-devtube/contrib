description: "Talk is aimed at developers who are familiar with the Web 2.0 client/server architecture for building web apps, who have heard about the hype around blockchains, and who want to step into its technical side. This talk will explain why we would develop on the blockchain Web3 architecture, and how to get started with it.\n\nThe talk will be divided into 2 parts: Why and How.\n\nThe first part will explain the transition from web2 to web3, following this schema (https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GD9K6mnI7NhKSf6g5PpL_A.png). I will detail the pros and cons of web2 vs web3 regarding each of the following components in a web app: computation, hosting, database and service layer.\n\nThe second part will show the state of web3 development today, and what we can do with its tools. More specifically, I will give an overview of the following mandatory steps to build a blockchain-based app:\n\nGet a blockchain client & set up and account\nTalk to the blockchain\nWrite & deploy a Smart Contract\nTransact with the Smart Contract\nAt the end of the talk, the audience will understand the fundamental difference between a web2 and a web3 app. The audience would also get a general picture of how to start writing code on the blockchain."
