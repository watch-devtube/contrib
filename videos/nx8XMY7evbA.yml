description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: David Dawson, Simplicity Itself\nG&G Special Topics\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/s2gx-philosophicalarchitecture\nSoftware development is hard. Life is hard. We try to keep up with a changing world, and it's hard.\n\nWhere though, does the problem lie?\n\nIn this talk, David, CEO at Simplicity Itself, will describe a different way of approaching the problem of software development, a different way of trying to keep up with a changing world.\nThis is not a soft talk, all opinions are backed up by cold hard code in a running Grails application, showing how a change in the way you think can radically change your software."
