description: "This presentation introduces a revolutionary new application performance monitoring approach based on a highly scalable discrete event simulation engine that replays, in near real time, the execution behavior and resource consumption of metered activities across an entire infrastructure of instrumented Java application runtimes within a single simulated Java application runtime.\n\n\nAuthor:\nWilliam Louth\nWilliam Louth is the CTO at JINSPIRED BV and the product architect of its innovative application performance management and resource metering solution, JXInsight/OpenCore, as well asJXInsight/Opus, JXInsight/Simz and JXInsight/Signals. He is recognized as one of the top engineers in the software performance engineering field. He has previously worked for Inprise/Borland on JavaEE/CORBA technologies and has provided technical advisory consultancy to many of the leading JVM & IT management vendors in the area of performance management, software runtime visualization, application deployment modeling and federated CMDB design. William spent his early engineering years in the telecommunication industry developing GSM billing engine software as well as least cost routing (LCR) systems for Europe wide traffic at AT&T. William has spoken at many conferences on performance measurement, runtime diagnostics and software execution costing & optimization management in the cloud including JavaOne, CloudConnect, CloudCamp, Velocity, BorCon, Jazoon, Software Test & Performance and JAX. He writes frequently on Quality of Service (QoS), API design, data visualization, complex adaptive systems, and intelligent instrumentation & measurement in the context of application runtimes and platforms on http://www.jinspired.com.\nView more trainings by William Louth at https://www.parleys.com/author/william-louth\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
