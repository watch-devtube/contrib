description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2015/joe-devivo\n\nHTTP/1 has had a good run, and to be honest, it's not going anywhere anytime soon. What it is doing, is going through TCP connections like nobody's business! If you're looking to streamline communications overhead between a browser and a server or lower the network traffic of your webservice calls, you might want to get on board this HTTP/2 bandwagon.\n\nI'm going to chat with you all about the HTTP protocol. How it does the things that it claims. What's so cool about HPACK? (Spoiler: it's the dynamic table, and the static table, and the Huffman encoding, ok there are a lot of cool parts).\n\nThen we'll talk about the Erlang implementation I've been working on, Chatterbox. And how far I've gotten with it. It wasn't done when I wrote this abstract, so we'll see how far I got together in Stockholm. I'll have future work outlined as well, which at some point I hope means being able to use Chatterbox as the HTTP server for WebMachine.\n\nTalk objectives: I want you to love HTTP/2, but you don't have to. You can hate it, but at least you'll know more about it, and we'll have some fun along the way.\n\nTarget audience: Those curious about HTTP/2, and how an Erlang implementation works. People who like pattern matching binaries. Protocol droids.\n\n\nWorking in Erlang for years at Basho and CHEF, Joe finally had an excuse to write a gen_fsm from scratch for Chatterbox. Joe's an Emacs poseur, who likes hacking Erlang with EDTS, but occasionally runs scared back to SublimeText 2. Maybe you've heard of him.\n\nJoe's been working with Erlang primarily since 2012, at Basho and now CHEF."
