description: "DevConf - The Software Craftsmen Festival for Sharing Knowledge and Inspiration (https://devconf.pl/)\n\nIn this talk I show some internals of exceptions. Examples are based on typical use cases and common mistakes. I show why calling async methods synchronously might be a bad idea, how to catch out of band exceptions or how to implement synchronization mechanisms to wait for async void. We know that we should have “async all the way” but very often we are forced to have some trickery because of frameworks we use."
