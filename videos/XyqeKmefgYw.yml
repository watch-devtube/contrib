description: 'In today''s increasing business need for more deploys, continuous testing, and better quality code, one thing that is not explicitly discussed is a strategy for how software teams should collaborate across their company. Before you invest all your time and energy into Continuous Integration or Continuous Delivery, make sure you have a solid foundation of Collaborative Development. In this talk, we''ll look at some collaboration patterns that have had success, why they''re important, and how you can adopt these patterns within your own software development teams to build software better tomorrow.'
