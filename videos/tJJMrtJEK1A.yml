title: 'Devon Estes | Refactoring Elixir - Lessons Learned from a Year on Exercism.Io'
language: English
recordingDate: 1496407689
description: "Filmed in Barcelona at ElixirConf EU 2017\n\nThere's a lot you can learn about the pitfalls of a language when you see literally hundreds of people all solving the same problems - and frequently making the same mistakes! In this talk we're going to start with some common, but less than optimal, solutions to some of the problems on exercism.io, and we'll do a step by step refactoring. We'll also add in some benchmarking to the existing exercism.io test suites to show the performance benefits of some of the refactoring that we do, and discuss the tradeoffs of the decisions that we're making to illustrate why this refactoring is beneficial.\n\nElixirConf EU is a community conference created to promote education, networking and collaboration within the Elixir/Erlang/Ruby communities."
