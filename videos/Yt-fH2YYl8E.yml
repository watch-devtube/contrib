description: "Update on Cloud Foundry Isolation Segments (formerly Elastic Clusters) - Dieu Cao, Pivotal\n\nMotivation: CF Operators want the ability to isolate workloads across separate networks, iaas’s, and datacenters to meet compliance, availability, and cost requirements. CF Operators expect to achieve this isolation without the added overhead of managing multiple full installs of Cloud Foundry.\n\nGoal: The goal of this set of features is to enable the cloud controller to address workloads to isolated compute, routing, and logging components and assign application placement by mapping a Cloud Foundry Space to an Isolation Segment. We intend to support a new bosh deployment, a Cloud Foundry Isolation Segment, that may include compute, routing, and logging components. The cloud controller will have added functionality to allow operators to manage segments of CF capacity via the api.\n\nAbout Dieu Cao\nDieu Cao is Director of Cloud Foundry Product Management at Pivotal focused on the strategic direction of Pivotal's Elastic Runtime product. | | She is also currently serving as the PMC Lead for the Cloud Foundry Foundation's Runtime PMC. | Prior to that, Dieu served as Product Manager at Greenplum working with Pivotal Labs on applications for use by data scientists."
