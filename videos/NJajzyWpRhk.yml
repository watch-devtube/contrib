description: "Ketan Gangatirkar, Indeed, Inc.\n\nThe goal of a Site Reliability Engineer is to create a reliable, scalable, performant service. To drive the right results, you need the right measures. Enter Service Level Objectives.\n\nA good SLO starts with your customers. Next understand the role your service plays in your business. Then turn the understanding into numbers. Dive into the data to discover where diminished reliability and performance harm user experience and business results. Only then you can set good objectives.\n\nGood SLOs will mirror your users' and business needs. When your users hurt, you want to know it. By feeling your users' pain you can discover the levels of service that hit the sweet spot of reliability, product success, and operability. It's empathy, but measured and quantified.\n\nThis talk will walk you step by step through finding, gathering, and understanding the inputs that inform good SLOs. We will review different classes of SLO and when to use them, with real examples to guide you. When you leave this talk, you'll be armed with practical advice to measure, validate, and improve the reliability of your products.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org\n\nSign up to find out more about Enigma at https://enigma.usenix.org"
