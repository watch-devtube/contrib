description: "Today I'm introducing a cryptocurrency for our community called SirajCoin. It will act as the fuel for our global community of developers to engage with me directly by spending it on my attention via hourly meetings and video collaborations. It will also unlock access to exclusive content, merchandise, and events. Importantly, the coin enables a novel governance structure in our community that gives members voting powers on how to best spend community funds. These funds can be used to fund AI research initiatives, elect community representatives, and empower other creators that spread AI knowledge. This cryptocurrency is the first step in establishing The School of AI, a world-wide network of programming wizards dedicated to solving AI through research and education. This is not about me making money, if i wanted to do that i would've said yes to one of the 1000 offers i get from big tech companies to sell out and make videos about their products on this channel. and no one would ever know. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/sirajcoin\n\n3 IMPORTANT NOTES\n1. The sirajcoin.io/your_public_key referral link system doesn't work yet, next week it will. I will update the community when it works.\n2. If you want some free SirajCoin right now, post your public address in the youtube comments section and I will send you some ASAP (if you have subscribed to this channel). \n3. A lot of the features of SirajCoin are a work in progress, and I'll need the help of our community to build them. So make issues and pull requests in the GitHub repo to help with this effort. The better this project goes, the better off we all will be. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/sirajcoin\n\nSirajCoin website:\nwww.sirajcoin.io\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like.
