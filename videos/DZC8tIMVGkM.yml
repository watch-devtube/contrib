title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Extending the abstract class of privilege: outcomes and lessons learned'
recordingDate: 1523517563
description: "The power of Drupal extends well beyond the realm of technology. It is the source of many people’s livelihoods. It has the power to be a tool for pulling people out of poverty and into a better life. Where does Drupal succeed / fail at being accessible to all backgrounds? How can we do better? Crucially, not everything is a technical problem. What other barriers (& solutions) are there?\n\nI have personally trained over 100 people, mostly non-developers, to be Drupal developers. The diversity I have seen in the classrooms is unparalleled and has opened my eyes to others’ realities. We typically have 50% female enrollment along with many from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Our classrooms have been so diverse that we’ve received hateful messages when sharing pictures of our alumni taking a group picture at Drupal GovCon. I’ve encountered a handful of unforeseen obstacles that really highlighted my relative privilege.\n\nThese are a few common student profiles which face issues that most don’t consider:\n\nOvercoming racial/personality biases\n\nPeople who do not have great computer skills\n\nPeople who work long/odd hours\n\nPeople who cannot afford training\n\nPhysically handicapped\n\nPeople who cannot focus in a classroom setting\n\nPeople with unsuitable laptops for development\n\nPeople whose living situations aren’t conducive to prolonged periods of deep thought\n\nWomen who gave up their technical careers to be mothers, and are looking for a way back into the workforce\n\nAnd more.\n\nOver the past 4 years, I have worked to combat these issues in a variety of ways. I have learned that many of us are privileged in ways we don’t realize, and that we have the ability to effectively extend that privilege to others. While people must do the work to benefit from Drupal themselves, extending your privilege to others when appropriate can help them realize a career when they may otherwise not have been in a position to do so.\n\nJoin this talk to learn:\n\nIssues others face (seen & unseen)\n\nHow to make more welcoming environment\n\nRemoving barriers\n\nHow to “extend privilege”\n\nWhat does and does not “scale” when helping others\n\nPersonal stories from multiple individuals of impactful moments leading towards Drupal improving their lives"
