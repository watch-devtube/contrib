language: English
recordingDate: 1432933383
description: "Speaker(s):\nAstro Teller\n\nDescription:\nVenture inside Google[x] for an in-depth conversation with Astro Teller, Captain of Moonshots, who will discuss one of the hardest parts of the innovation process -- the part where you come into contact with the real world, and learn what's wrong with what you’ve done so far. He'll explain why failure is so important to the innovation process at Google[x], and how we relentlessly seek out contact with the harsh realities of weather, physics, humanity, and much more, because so much of what we have to learn can't be predicted by a book, taught in school or observed in a lab. He'll illustrate this by sharing hard-earned lessons from Project Loon, the self-driving car, Makani and more.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2015 videos at: g.co/dev/io15videos.\n\n#io15"
