description: "Disaster Recovery from Day 1 for every system with SHIELD - Dr Nic Williams, Stark & Wayne    \n\nBOSH and GCP make it incredibly easy to bring up vast arrays of production systems - Cloud Foundry, Kubo, monitoring systems, data services, and more. Unfortunately, you might not have a homogenous way to immediately commence backups of all data on all systems. A system is only a \"production system\" when operators know how to restore it after a disaster.\n\nFortunately, SHIELD is an open source standalone system that can perform backup and restore functions for a wide variety of pluggable data systems. SHIELD can be deployed with BOSH, and integrated to backup/restore both BOSH deployments and BOSH director itself. It has also been integrated with various Chef Habitat plans to provide backup/restore out of the box. \n\nOne of the pluggable storage systems is GCP's own object store.\n\n\nDr. Nic Williams\nStark & Wayne\nCEO\nDr Nic Williams is one of the foremost open source developers and evangelists in the Cloud Foundry and BOSH ecosystems. Dr Nic discovered Cloud Foundry and BOSH in April 2011 and has been contributing to it, extensions, BOSH releases, tutorials, and blog posts ever since.\n\nDr Nic is also the founder and CEO of Stark & Wayne - the premier consultancy for Cloud Foundry operations and development - with over 30 staff in USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia. We love that Cloud Foundry makes people happy."
