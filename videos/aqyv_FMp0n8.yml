description: "Recently I did a talk on `process.nextTick()` & `setImmediate()` for flow control. I think it could use a bit of polish to meet these two points mentioned:\n\n- Don't talk about a technology, tell the story of what you did with that technology.\n- SFest is designed to be accessible. Talks should be targetted at new to intermediate skill levels.\n\nTalk slides & example code starting point: https://github.com/sprjr/baynode-flow-control\n\nI had a few 'aha' comments after and think it might be something I could improve quite a bit for JSFest Oakland.\n\nLet me know what you think, thanks!"
