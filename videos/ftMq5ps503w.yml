description: "We're going to predict the closing price of the S&P 500 using a special type of recurrent neural network called an LSTM network. I'll explain why we use recurrent nets for time series data, and why LSTMs boost our network's memory power. \n\nCoding challenge for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/How-to-Predict-Stock-Prices-Easily-Demo\n\nVishal's winning code:\nhttps://github.com/erilyth/DeepLearning-SirajologyChallenges/tree/master/Image_Classifier\n\nJie's runner up code:\nhttps://github.com/jiexunsee/Simple-Inception-Transfer-Learning\n\nMore Learning Resources:\nhttp://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/\nhttp://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html\nhttps://deeplearning4j.org/lstm.html\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/recurrent\nhttp://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/\nhttps://blog.terminal.com/demistifying-long-short-term-memory-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks/\n\nPlease subscribe!
