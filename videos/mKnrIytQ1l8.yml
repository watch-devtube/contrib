title: 'Patents and Copyright and Trademarks… Oh, why!? by Andrea Casillas'
recordingDate: 1408409909
description: "There’s a constellation of legal constructs that you often hear referred to collectively as “intellectual property law.” That’s a tricky term because it encourages you to think of these three separate legal ideas as more or less the same, even though they’re very different. More importantly, each type of “intellectual property” has different implications for free and open source software developers.\n\nThese three concepts were originally designed to provide ownership rights for tangible creations. Software isn’t particularly well-served by any of these mechanisms and so we use different concepts for different parts of our software. Just to make it more confusing, each of these mechanisms has also evolved and expanded over time. If you’ve ever wondered why patents are so tricky when applied to software or how copyright law works, then this the talk for you.\n\nAbsolutely none of this is meant to stand in for legal advice. However, your time with a lawyer can be greatly shortened when you have a good grasp of the basic legal concepts going in.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. \n\nAugust 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"
