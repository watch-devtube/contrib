description: "Seth Ladd's talk centers on what he calls a declarative renaissance. His presentation includes a compilation of demos and examples, taken from Web Components and Google's Dart, that introduce you to the concepts and then show you how you can start writing for concise code without all the div soup.\n\nWeb Engineer and Developer Advocate at Google, Seth delivers an enthusiastic talk to the San Francisco HTML5 User Group that argues that Web Components and Dart work really well together. Seth then invites you to try out (and give feedback for) these open source tools today!\n\n**Want more videos on Dart and HTML5? We've got tons more on our site!: https://marakana.com/s/tags/html5"
