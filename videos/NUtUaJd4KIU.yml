recordingDate: 1433517742
description: "Java malware is used by cybercriminals to conduct identify theft, establish botnets, or undertake other malicious activities on client machines. Users who run a JRE without applying updates are the typical victims of Java malware. This session looks behind the scenes at how malware is implemented, distributed, and applied on the victim’s host. To stay unnoticed, Java malware applies a set of techniques to work under the radar of host intrusion detection systems. The presentation shows several techniques for disguising the purpose of evil mobile code. Typical important approaches are data and control flow obfuscation. To illustrate the inner workings, the talk presents tools and techniques for safely analyzing the behavior of unknown JARs prior to execution.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMarc Schönefeld\nMarc is working within the Java Security community\nsince 2002, first as part of  this PhD thesis research, and later\n(2007-2011) as member of the Red Hat Security Response Team. \nIn 2011 he joined Oracle's Java Vulnerability team. \n\nView more trainings by Marc Schönefeld at https://www.parleys.com/author/marc-schonefeld-2\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
