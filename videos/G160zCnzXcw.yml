description: 'For those that don''t know what Map/Reduce is, it is a programming model, or framework if you like it more that way, for processing large (seriously large) data sets in distributed manner, using large number of computers, i.e. nodes. Apache Hadoop is very popular free implementation of this framework.  Same as the problem it addresses, it is not simple tool and not very easy to use. The subject of the talk will be a showcase of imaginary social network and it''s algorithm used to determine an importance of connections between "friends" - using Java Map/Reduce API as well as Apache Pig script approach.'
