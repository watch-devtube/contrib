description: "PyData LA 2018 \n\nStaticFrame provides Pandas-like data structures that enforce immutability. StaticFrame narrows and refines Pandas-style interfaces, which, when combined with immutability, reduces opportunities for error. In addition, StaticFrame offers a range of new and powerful iterators for function application with built-in concurrency.\n\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
