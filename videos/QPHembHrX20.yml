title: 'No: Insubordination in Service of Resiliency and Safety - Roy Rapoport'
recordingDate: 1532549991
description: "Keynote by Roy Rapoport at the annual Wix Engineering Conference 2018:\n\nThere's a myth that effective organizations are ones where everyone marches in lockstep.  In this discussion, Roy addresses the role of insubordination -- the \"defiance of authority or refusal to obey orders\" -- in healthy organizations and management structures as an intentional method of building up organizational resiliency and creating safer environments for decision-making.  Roy talks about principles, perspectives, and both effective and hilariously ineffective examples of this, from his own 25 years of being a pain in the neck to the people managing him.\n\nRoy Rapoport leads the Data Engineering organization at Slack, where he is tasked with helping scale Slack's data organization to deal with massive data, tractable questions in need of answers, and the fundamental question frustrating data people everywhere: \"What does this even mean?\" (but he's not speaking for Slack).  Before this he spent some years at Netflix, both in IT and in Engineering responsible for Netflix's real-time operational insight systems.  He has an eclectic background in software engineering, IT, operations, network and systems engineering, and QA, which is probably about as relevant as mentioning that he owns goats."
