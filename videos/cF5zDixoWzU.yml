description: "Speaker: Miro Cupak\r\n\r\nMiro Cupak is a popular speaker at JavaOne and will be visiting us in Singapore this week.\r\nHe is a senior software engineer at DNAstack, where he develops a leading genomics cloud platform. He is a Java enthusiast with expertise in distributed systems and middleware. In his spare time, he blogs and contributes to several open-source projects.\r\n\r\nOne of the more interesting features of the latest release of Java is undoubtedly JShell, Java’s Read-Eval-Print-Loop implementation, which makes exploration of new APIs faster and easier. The release, however, packs many other smaller and less-known features and APIs, which are often overlooked, but can have a huge impact on application development. In this live-demo session, we will use JShell to explore several smaller new and updated APIs in Java 9, including the convenience factory methods for collections, Stream API, Optional, CompletableFuture, Stackwalker, Process API, and HTTP/2 client.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/singajug/events/246401738/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael Cheng\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/diom/"
