description: 'With TensorFlow, deep machine learning transitions from an area of research to mainstream software engineering. In this session, we''ll work together to construct and train a neural network that recognises handwritten digits. Along the way, we''ll discover some of the "tricks of the trade" used in neural network design, and finally, we''ll bring the recognition accuracy of our model above 99%.'
