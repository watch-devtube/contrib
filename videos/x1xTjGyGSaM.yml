recordingDate: 1382197120
description: "Erlang is a language designed for building highly concurrent, highly available systems. And, based on our experience using it to build a large-scale VoIP soft-switch, it does a great job of this.\n\nHowever...every languages has a collection of \"gotchas\" which developers often don't discover until they're neck-deep in building a big system. If they're really lucky, they'll discover them before the users do.\n\nI love Erlang as a language, but in this respect it's no different from any others. This talk aims to briefly cover the things it would have been nice to have known before we ran head-long into them such as:\n\nHow to crash your VM (and how not to)\nMessage queues: they're not magic\nWhy you can't just run Erlang as a Unix-style service (and how you can)\nHot Code Loading: not as easy as you might hope\nThe OTP: Forget everything they taught you in the first Erlang lesson\nSystem monitoring is even more important than you think\n\nFor more on YOW!
