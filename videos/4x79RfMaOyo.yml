description: "Ray Tsang, Developer Advocate, Google\n\nMicroservices are here to stay. When applied properly, microservices techniques and culture help us continuously improve business at a faster pace than traditional architecture. However, microservices architecture itself can be complex. We are faced with the need for service discovery and load balance, deal with network resilience, enforce service policies and audit, and trace nested services calls. The list goes on.... It’s easy to have a single stack/framework that makes everything work, but what if you have a polyglot environment or need interoperability between legacy and modern services? How can you make sure the whole stack can address the same concerns in a consistent way? This session addresses how Istio can help you deal with these cross-cutting concerns."
