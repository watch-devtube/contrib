description: "In 20 years I learned how to step outside my introverted personality to explore the world in a more successful way, but not without bumps and bruises which taught me valuable lessons.\n\nThis is my story of that journey which I hope to convey to those listening that being a deep introvert should not prevent them from trying and achieving goals in life up to and including being a professional social engineer and beyond. I wrap up with the specific lessons I learned over the course of that time, so others can reap the benefits of those lessons in a much shorter time frame."
