title: 'Practical Tips and Tricks with Spring Integration'
recordingDate: 1335309440
description: "By Oleg Zhurakousky\n\nThe idea for this webinar was triggered by our desire to share some of the more interesting integration solutions that came out of the actual customer engagements as well as the questions that are most frequently asked on Spring Integration forums. We will showcase the Spring Integration framework and how it can help you to build, manage and maintain powerful enterprise-grade integration solutions. Most importantly you will get an opportunity to ask questions which will be answered by the same engineers that develop Spring Integrations framework.\nIn this session of \"Practical Tips-and-Tricks\" we will cover some of the more advanced topics of enterprise integration such as message-flow-segmentation, custom retry logic, error handling, timeouts and more. This webinar is based on the refined (based on your feedback) version of a very successful talk delivered by Oleg Zhurakousky at SpringOne 2011.\n\nTo review basics of messaging and Spring Integration watch the Message Driven Architecture video with Mark Fisher at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAWpVS8t_Ug."
