description: "How does it keep happening? I mean why are websites so consistently hacked? Is it the work of sophisticated cyber-villains operating from underground lairs? As it turns out, many of today’s online attacks are mounted by kids – legally children – who simply have time, patience and access to Google.\nIn this session we’re going to look at and execute a heap of online attacks with tools that even kids can use. You’ll learn just how easy it is to mount these attacks and most importantly, what it is you need to do to keep your apps secure not just from mischievous kids, but from cyber-criminals and even nation state actors.\n\nThis talk is scary, entertaining and will make you distrusting of any kid with a PC."
