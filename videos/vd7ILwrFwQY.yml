description: "One of the factors limiting SVG adoption is the association with XML. XML has been helpful in a number of ways: from providing a concrete syntax that enables both a focus on higher level constructs and simplifies tooling. It also has been an inhibitor in places where tight integration with less well formed content is a necessity.\n\nThis talk is about small lessons that you can learn from the web to increase adoption of SVG, and big lessons of the web that you will have to deal that will be direct consequences of the \"unwashed masses\" copy/pasting SVG fragments onto MySpace pages or equivalent and expecting it to all \"just work\"."
