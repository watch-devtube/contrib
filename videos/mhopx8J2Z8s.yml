description: "by Jan (janneke) Nieuwenhuizen\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.201/gnumes.webm\n\n\nTwo years ago on FOSDEM'17 a minimalistic bootstrap was a dream; today it has started to become reality.\nBootstrapping GNU/Linux without use of the GNU toolchain (gcc, binutils, glibc) was our first milestone\nthat we just reached.  Mes became a GNU project.\nWe will talk about what bootstrapping is and why it is important.\nWe will show how Mes' minimalistic Scheme has made this possible and on future milestones (Scheme\nonly bootstrap, other GNU/Linux distributions) before reaching the holy grail: a full source bootstrap. \n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 15:20:00+01"
