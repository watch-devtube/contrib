description: "From the 2014 Solid Conference: Kipp Bradford's Keynote talk, \"The Future is Solid - Radical Mechanisms of Economic Change\".\n\nIn this talk, Kipp Bradford, founder of The Kippworks, explores how scaling upwards and creating networks out of smaller elements can create new, previously unseen possibilities and efficiencies. The real world sees many of these scaling discontinuities - when networked economies meet frictionless, seemingly limitless idea frameworks. This is when radical economic change can happen.\n\nAbout Kipp Bradford (The Kippworks):\nKipp Bradford is an educator, technology consultant, and entrepreneur with a passion for making things.
