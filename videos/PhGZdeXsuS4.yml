description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nThe paper explores some of Haskell's support for genericity through type classes, Functors, Monads, and Continuations and their impact on lanugages such as C++, Scala, and Rust. We explore these language features and consider alternatives that have been proposed to existing language features, including Object Algebras, GADTs, Open data types, open pattern matching, and extensions to Haskell's type system that impact the type inference algorithm and decidability. We use a number of case studies to demonstrate what proposed solutions look like in the target languages, considering how easy they are to use and how well the solutions integrate with existing linguistic features.\n— \nSherri Shulman is a member of the faculty in Computer Science at The Evergreen State College\n\nI have been teaching at Evergreen for 23 years. My primary interests include language design, the role of types in programming, comparative programming languages, and higher order programming and its impact on software reuse. I regularly teach introduction to programming using Haskell and then transition to C and C++. I particularly like showing how different languages address similar problems, and how ideas from one language can be reflected in others.\n\nC++ interests include generic programming, functional programming features, and higher order forms.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
