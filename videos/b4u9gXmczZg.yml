description: "Another in a series of discussions with Sergiusz Wolicki, Database Globalization Architect at Oracle Corporation.\n\nDo you have questions about internationalizing your Oracle Database applications, configuring globalization (NLS) settings in the database, or migrating the database character set to Unicode with the DMU utility? Do you want to know the various datetime data types or do you want to understand why you see all these funny characters on the screen in place of the expected non-English data? To find an answer, just join our session and ask -- we can answer most database globalization questions right away and we will be happy to search for an answer to the remaining ones. Within the limits of our expertise, we will also try to answer globalization questions about products other than Oracle Database. \n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
