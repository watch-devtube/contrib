description: "Hybrid Cloud in Finance - John Wetherill, BNY Mellon (moderator), David Lewis, BNY Mellon, and Asif Alam, Thomson Reuters, Janga Aliminati, Visa\n\nEvery major global financial institution is encountering the cloud, and each is adopting it in their own way. Some are diving in the deep end, moving all software delivery to public cloud like AWS or Azure. Others choose to keep everything on premise. Others are taking a \"wait and see\" approach, while still others are combining the best of both public and private clouds, adopting a hybrid strategy. \n\nThis technical panel discussion features thought leaders from several major global finance corporations. It will explore the role of hybrid cloud in global enterprise software delivery. The  panelists will present their unique experienced viewpoints on the pros and cons of hybrid cloud, the reasons they have, or have not moved to hybrid, and the challenges they're facing in whatever cloud adoption strategy they've chosen, whether public, private, or hybrid.  This promises to be an invigorating, charged, and possibly somewhat controversial debate. \n\nAsif Alam\nGlobal Business Director - Technology Sector, Thomson Reuters Corporate\n\nDavid Lewis\nDirector Architecture and Platform Services, BNY Mellon\n\nJohn Wetherill\nJohn Wetherill, Principal Architect at BNY Mellon's Innovation Center in Palo Alto, spent much of his career designing and building software at a handful of startups, at Sun Microsystems, NeXT Inc., and in the smart grid and energy space.
