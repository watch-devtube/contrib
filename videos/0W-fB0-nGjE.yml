description: "Find more information here: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/graphs-streams-rethinking-graph-processing-streaming-era\n\nStreaming is the latest hot topic in the big data world. We want to process data immediately and continuously. Modern stream processors have matured significantly and offer exceptional features, including sub-second latencies, high throughput, fault-tolerance, and seamless integration with various data sources and sinks.\n\nMany sources of streaming data consist of related or connected events: user interactions in a social network, web page clicks, movie ratings, product purchases. These connected events can be naturally represented as edges in an evolving graph.\n\nIn this talk I will explain how we can leverage a powerful stream processor, such as Apache Flink, and academic research of the past two decades, to build graph streaming applications. I will describe how we can model graphs as streams and how we can compute graph properties without storing and managing the graph state. I will introduce useful graph summary data structures and show how they allow us to build graph algorithms in the streaming model, such as connected components, bipartiteness detection, and distance estimation."
