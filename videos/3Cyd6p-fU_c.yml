description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2018\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nJordan Hendricks - Software Engineer at Joyent\n\nABSTRACT\nDesigning a distributed system (or any system) effectively requires careful design decisions based on tradeoffs within a set of constraints. Making changes to a mature system, whether by adding a new feature or just improving it, constrains the problem further: Changes should not violate existing invariant of the system, and they should work harmoniously in the context of tradeoffs made for the system long ago.\nThis talk will explore a case study of expanding a distributed system: designing a multipart upload API for Manta, Joyent’s highly-scalable distributed object store. We will talk about [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2018/sessions/364\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
