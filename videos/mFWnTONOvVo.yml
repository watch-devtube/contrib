description: "Google Tech Talk\nSeptember 27, 2010\n\nPresented by Dr. Eric C. Leuthardt, Washington University.\n\nThe notion that a computer can decode brain signals to infer the intentions of a human and then enact those intentions directly through a machine is becoming a realistic technical possibility. These types of devices are known as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). In the near term, the evolution of these neuroprosthetic technologies could have significant implications for patients with motor disabilities by enhancing their ability to interact and communicate with their environment. Further into the future, these approaches could substantially alter how humans and machines interact. This talk will review the cortical signals, technical approaches, and current barriers to bringing BCIs to real world application and projecting their future implications on a broader social scale.\n\nEric C. Leuthardt, M.D. is a neurosurgeon who is currently an assistant professor with the Department of Neurological Surgery and the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. He is Director of the Center for Innovation in Neuroscience and Technology. His research has focused on neuroprosthetics.-- devices linked to the brain that may lead to novel treatment for paralysis as result of spinal cord injury or stroke. His work in the field of neuroprosthetics and neurosurgical devices has yielded him numerous accolades as a scientist, a neurosurgeon, and an inventor. On a national level, he was named one of the Top Young Innovators by MIT's magazine Technology Review. Dr. Leuthardt uses an integrated approach by employing multiple domains of expertise ranging from biomedical engineering, clinical neurosurgery, mathematical modeling, complex signal analysis, and computer programming. In addition to numerous peer reviewed publications, Leuthardt has numerous patents on file with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for medical devices and brain computer interface technologies. Currently, he is ranked as the fifth most prolific inventor in the world."
