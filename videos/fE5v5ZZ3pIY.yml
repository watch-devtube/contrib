description: "This session provides a coding and design example of an Internet of Things retail monitoring project (Internet of Things Forerunner) built on the Freescale i.MX6-based One Box connecting various wireless RFID sensors to a Java SE Embedded gateway in brick-and-mortar retail stores sending data to a back-end data center for big data analysis, using an Oracle Business Intelligence server. Come learn how to connect a Freescale i.MX6-based One Box to the data center, using Java SE Embedded technology and BI server technology with a real-time connection to Oracle enterprise back-end software that tracks retail store inventory control and customer sales recommendations. The session shows how to develop Java SE Embedded apps that connect to Oracle middleware with the Freescale One Box.\n\n\nAuthor:\n Hinkmond Wong\nHinkmond Wong is a Consulting Member of Technical Staff with the Java\nEmbedded group and has been working at former Sun Microsystems, Inc.,\nnow Oracle for over 19 years.
