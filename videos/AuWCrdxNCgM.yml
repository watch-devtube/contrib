description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nVisual C++ supports mobile app development for Windows, Android, and iOS from a single code base, optionally with a thin platform-specific UI layer. The resulting binaries can be deployed to an emulator or to a real device and debugged on both, all from within Visual C++ . This presentation is a follow up to my session given at CppCon 2015, and as such the session will only briefly cover the basics of cross-platform mobile app development. Please view https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y47g8xNE1o or https://channel9.msdn.com/events/CPP/CppCon-2015/CPPConD02V019 for this material in depth. In this follow up, we go over the new features added for cross-platform development since last year. Additionally, we continue where last year’s session ended, and will go deeper on how to write your applications to have a native look-and-feel UI on each of the different platforms.\n— \nMarc Gregoire\nNikon Metrology\nSoftware Architect\nBelgium\nMarc Gregoire has worked as a software engineer consultant for 6 years for Siemens and Nokia Siemens Networks on critical 2G and 3G software running on Solaris for telecom operators. This required working in international teams stretching from South America and USA to EMEA and Asia. Now, Marc is working for Nikon Metrology on 3D scanning software. His main expertise is C/C++, and specifically Microsoft VC++ and the MFC framework. Next to C/C++, Marc also likes C# and uses PHP for creating web pages. In addition to his main interest for Windows development, he also has experience in developing C++ programs running 24x7 on Linux platforms; for example, EIB/KNX home automation controlling and monitoring software. Since April 2007, he received the yearly Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) award for his Visual C++ expertise. Marc is the author of \"Professional C++, Second and Third Edition\", published by Wiley/Wrox, is the founder of the Belgian C++ Users Group (www.becpp.org), and has written a number of articles which have been published on CodeGuru and/or his personal blog. He also creates freeware and shareware programs that are distributed through his website at www.nuonsoft.com, and maintains a blog on www.nuonsoft.com/blog/. He is also passionate about traveling and gastronomic restaurants.m\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
