description: "Waiting for the next Design Patterns video? It's coming by the end of the week. Sorry to keep you waiting. Meanwhile... here's Code Walk #58, where we talk about daring to delete your code and start over. Don't be afraid to delete code.\n\nShare your thoughts in the comments. Is there value in deleting code and starting over?\n\nShow your support on Patreon:\nhttp://patreon.christopherokhravi.com\n\nP.s. I'm working on setting up a podcast where I will publish the code walks as audio (a big thanks to those who suggested it) so stay tuned to get notified of when it happens :D"
