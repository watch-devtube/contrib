description: "by Sander van Geloven\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2215/nuspell.webm\n\n\nNuspell is a FOSS checker that is written in pure C++14. It extensively supports character encodings, locales, compounding, affixing and complex morphology. Existing spell checking in web browsers, office suits, IDEs and other text editors can use this as a drop-in replacement. Nuspell supports 90 languages, suggestions and personal dictionaries. In this talk we will highlight the functionality of Nuspell and provide easy to follow examples on how to use it as a command-line tool or link to the C++ library. The audience will be invited to integrate this new spell checker into their software, create new language bindings or port it to other operating systems. \n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 11:00:00+01"
