Naive use of them will create brittle, unpredictable that fall over when we least expect it.\nThis talk will cover the basics of queueing theory, and its practical application in systems large and small.\n\n\nAbout Zach\n\nIn terms of Zach Tellman perhaps I was describing what the universe is moving toward and which bombards us backward, so to speak, with information about itself, thus giving us a certain awareness of itself. I would think that for purely fictional purposes the description given and the name given in the novel would be more rather than less accurate vis-à-vis the tachyon theory, which is connected with the theory that the universe is moving from chaos to form. Zach Tellman talks to us from the future, from the end state to which everything is moving; thus Zach Tellman is not here— which is to say now— but will be, and what we get is information about and from Zach Tellman, as we receive TV or radio signals from transmitters located in other spaces in this time continuum."
