description: "Launching the Next Generation Satellite Ground System on Cloud Foundry and Microservices – One Year Later - Michael Weirzbinski, DigitalGlobe; Mike Waters, DigitalGlobe; & Steve Wall, ECS Team\n\nLast year at Cloud Foundry Summit, DigitalGlobe presented its rationale, plans, and early experience in the use of Cloud Foundry as the basis of its next generation Ground System. It’s now a year later, and we are in the midst of realizing that vision – culminating in a launch of DigitalGlobe’s latest satellite, WorldView-4, later this year. \n\nThis presentation describes the discoveries that we’ve made in scaling up a major development effort running on top of Cloud Foundry. It includes discussion of our current environment as well as how we have overcome both technical and cultural challenges along the way. Finally, we’ll include a discussion of the how our view of Cloud Foundry, microservices, and related infrastructure have evolved over the last year.\n\nSteve Wall\nECSTeam\nDirector of Solutions Architecture\nDenver\nSteve Wall works is a Director of Solutions Architecture for ECS Team. Digital Globe is building out a new Enterprise platform with Cloud Foundry as a key component. Steve's role has been to assist the Enterprise Architecture with product selection, initial microservice exploration, followed by the build out of the automated pipeline and now helping to on board the Digital Globe community as a whole to the platform. Recent speaking engagements include Cloud Foundry presentations at the Denver Java User Group, Denver Open Source User Group and Colorado Springs Open Source User Group. Steve also spoke at last years Cloud Foundry Summit.\n\nMike Waters\nDigitalGlobe\nEnterprise Architect\nLongmont, CO\nMike Waters works for DigitalGlobe as an Enterprise Architect/Software Architect. He is the lead Software Architect on DigitalGlobe's next generation Ground System. Mike has led DigitalGlobe's efforts to adopt microservices architecture and is the lead designer in planning the evolution of DigitalGlobe to adopt this new paradigm. Prior to working at DigitalGlobe he worked in the 9-1-1 Industry developing software and architectures for 9-1-1 call handling and data processing. Mike has also worked at U.S. West and GeoIT/KEMA Consulting as a geospatial software developer. Mike has presented at multiple conferences, and meetups, including recent speaking at the Denver Cloud Foundry Meetup.\n\nMichael Weirzbinski\nMike Wierzbinski is DigitalGlobe's Enterprise Cloud Architect, focusing on Enterprise adoption and migration to Cloud technologies. Throughout his career, Mike has focused on geospatial technologies and architectures that promote the use of geospatial information as an enterprise resource. Mike is currently embedded in the Architecture team designing DigitalGlobe's next-generation Ground System. Mike has presented at multiple conferences, and meetups, including recent speaking at the Denver Cloud Foundry Meetup. Mike presented DigitalGlobe's Cloud Foundry strategy at last years Cloud Foundry Summit."
