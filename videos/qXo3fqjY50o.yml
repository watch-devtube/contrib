Dumbfounded, you chase after them only to discover a magical world you never knew was right under your office...\"\n\nThis talk is a choose-your-own-adventure, where you decide what you want to learn about Ruby's garbage collector!\n\nGet an easy introduction to how garbage collection works, the clever performance optimizations used by Ruby, and even what the future might look like."
