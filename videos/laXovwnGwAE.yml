description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch 9, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis talk describes recent work of the UCLA Center for Image and Vision Science for learning to detect and recognize objects in natural images. This includes a real-time system for detecting text in unconstrained environments. Other examples include unsupervised learning of probabilistic grammars for detecting, recognizing, and segmenting objects.  Credits: Speaker:Alan Yuille"
