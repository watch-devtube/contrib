language: English
recordingDate: 1526544155
description: 'Terraform enables you to safely and predictably write, plan, and provision infrastructure as code. It codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared amongst team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned. This demo-driven talk shows how you can use Terraform and GitHub together to get CD for infrastructure - all completely free and open source.'
