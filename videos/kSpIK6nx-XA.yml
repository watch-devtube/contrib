description: "The history of the relationship between CSS and JS traces back to the origins of web UI development. Their symbiosis has evolved into a dynamic, ever-evolving ecosystem. But this was not a voluntary coexistence. The communication between each other has been forced.\n\nCSS Variables is the new promising future for CSS and JS. The alliance that should finally bring harmony in front-end development. In this talk, we will uncover some truths, myths, and lies behind them. Starting with the syntax and specification. We will showcase examples that highlight some of the incredibly useful features. We’ll also uncover some obscure secrets that could endanger this new alliance."
