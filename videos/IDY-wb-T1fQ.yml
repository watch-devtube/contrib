description: 'I’ve been working with Oracle tech for 25 years, often developing code in PL/SQL, and I’ve been lucky enough to be successful at it – and yet I am slow at writing code, I make lots of mistakes and I keep forgetting syntax. So how have I managed to not only avoid getting fired but make a living as a consultant? I put it down to just a couple of things and this talk is about perhaps the most important – Instrumentation. I''ll cover why you should instrument your code, how to use Oracle features to do so and using that instrumentation to not only solve problems but avoid them in the first place. I mostly use PL/SQL as the example but a lot of this is relevant to any language accessing an Oracle database.'
