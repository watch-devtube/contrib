title: 'Andy Wingo: JavaScriptCore''s DFG JIT -- JSConf EU 2012'
language: English
recordingDate: 1352307105
description: "Now that JavaScriptCore is as fast as V8 on its own benchmark, it's well past time to take a look inside JSC's optimizing compiler, the DFG JIT.\n\nIn this talk we'll take a look at how the DFG works, what kind of code it does well on, and where it's going. This is a talk for folks that like bits and compilers, but also for people interested in another engine for high-performance JavaScript.\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us. The speakers retain the copyright for their performances."
