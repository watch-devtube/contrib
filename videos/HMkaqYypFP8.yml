description: "This is part 2. Part 1 is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMkaqYypFP8\n\nI implemented a scheme of default values with an explicit way of declaring that things should not be initialized.\n\nSome folks seem to really like these live-coding sessions so I figure I'll keep doing them. My apologies if I ramble; I am thinking hard sometimes!"
