language: English
recordingDate: 1478765981
description: "gRPC is a high performance, language-neutral, general RPC framework developed and open sourced by Google. Built on the HTTP/2 standard, gRPC brings many benefits such as bidirectional streaming, flow control, header compression, multiplexing and more. In this session, you will learn about gRPC and how you can use it in your Java applications through a series of code samples and demos.\n\nMete Atamel\nI'm a Developer Advocate at Google, currently focused on helping developers with Google Cloud Platform. As a long-time Java and a recent C# developer, I like to compare the two ecosystems. Prior to Google, I worked at Microsoft, Skype, Adobe, EMC, and Nokia building apps and services on various web, mobile and cloud platforms. Originally from Cyprus, I currently live in Greenwich, not too far away from the prime meridian.\n\n[AUZ-9008]"
