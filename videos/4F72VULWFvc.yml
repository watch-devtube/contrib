description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nNovember 20, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nIs your code full of if statements? Switch statements? Do you have the same switch statement in various places? When you make changes do you find yourself making the same change to the same if/switch in several places? Did you ever forget one?\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss approaches to using Object Oriented techniques to remove many of those conditionals. The result is cleaner, tighter, better designed code that's easier to test, understand and maintain.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Misko Hevery"
