description: "by Steinar H. Gunderson\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/media_futatabi.webm\n\n\nFutatabi is a free software solution for doing instant replay, e.g. for sports production. It supports multiple cameras, high-quality realtime slow motion on the GPU through optical flow, and seamless integration with Nageru, my live video mixer. We'll talk a bit about how interpolation through optical flow works, challenges in transporting the streams back and forth, and demonstrate a real-world sports production done last year using Nageru and Futatabi. \n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 15:00:00+01"
