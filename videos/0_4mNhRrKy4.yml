description: 'The container abstraction hit the collective developer mind with great force and created a space of innovation for the distribution, configuration and deployment of cloud based applications. Now that this new model has established itself work is moving towards orchestration and coordination of loosely coupled network services. There is an explosion of tools in this arena at different degrees of stability but the momentum is huge. On the above premise this session we''ll give an overview of the orchestration landscape and a (semi)live demo of cluster management using a sample application.'
