Try to imagine how numbers in JavaScript feel - they are stuck between +/- 9007199254740991. Unable to breathe, they are stuck.\n\nI will talk about how we can free numbers in JavaScript to represent values much larger than their natural constraints. The talk will navigate through increasingly creative techniques to represent numbers of ever increasing values - freeing numbers from their constraints as well as ourselves."
