title: '5.2: Associative Arrays in JavaScript - Programming with Text'
language: English
recordingDate: 1475875025
description: "In this video, I discuss the concept of \"associative arrays\" in JavaScript.  I look at how JavaScript objects are collections of name-value (or key-value) pairs.  This works in much the same as dictionaries in Python or HashMaps in Java.  This concecpt will come extremely handy in the coding challenges around word counting.\n\nNext Video: https://youtu.be/unm0BLor8aE\n\nhttp://shiffman.net/a2z/text-analysis/\n\nCourse url: http://shiffman.net/a2z/\n\nSupport this channel on Patreon: https://patreon.com/codingtrain\n\nSend me your questions and coding challenges!: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Topics\n\nContact: https://twitter.com/shiffman\n\nGitHub Repo with all the info for Programming from A to Z: https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F16\n\nLinks discussed in this video:\nITP from Tisch School of the Arts: https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp\n\n \nSource Code for the all Video Lessons: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code\n\np5.js: https://p5js.org/\nProcessing: https://processing.org\n\nFor More Programming from A to Z videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?shelf_id=11&view=50&sort=dd\n\nFor More Coding Challenges: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WwkS/"
