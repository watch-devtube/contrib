description: "A brief journey through the scaling that we had to deal with at Zeebox, and how running on the JVM allowed us to bring some very effective and mature tools to bear on profiling & load-testing tools to bear, how we primarily use Akka as an asynchronous/event-driven framework far more than we use it as an Actor framework, how we use JSON as the lingua-franca across hundreds of nodes in EC2, and how the ability to create DSLs in Scala and to easily create the right abstractions made it far easier to test ideas and to rapidly change bad decisions. \n\n\n\n\nLiked the song?
