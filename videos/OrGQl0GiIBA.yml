description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nA Universal Central IPAM for Pod With Multiple Network Interfaces - Mengxin Liu, Alauda \n\nWhen telecom industries decides to move to Kubernetes, migrating the existing complex network topology is the No.1 headache. Workloads with multiple network interfaces that resident in different type of networks, with fixed IPs or even with fixed public IPs are common requirements across the industry.    Some IPAMs focus on local address allocation and do not have the cluster wide info, like the host-local IPAM. Others are very implementation specific, like the Calico-IPAM. This speech will introduce a universal central IPAM that has a global view of different network type and address ranges and can provide advanced IPAM functions like subnets, fixed IPs and IP reservations to other CNI compatible network plugin.    This speech will also show a telecom example of how to use this IPAM to manage pods that resident at the edge with multiple networks. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp8x"
