title: 'It''s a kind of magic: under the covers of Spring Boot by Stéphane Nicoll & Andy Wilkinson'
language: English
recordingDate: 1478594617
description: "One of Spring Boot's most powerful features is its auto-configuration. This magic is key to the convention-over-configuration approach that has brought a huge boost in productivity to Java developers. But is it really magic? We don't think so.\n\nIn this session we'll take a look under the covers of Spring Boot. You'll learn about auto-configuration and the conditional configuration model that powers it, helping you to be even more productive when writing Spring Boot applications.\n\nWe'll also look at the new testing support in Spring Boot 1.4. These enhancements bring the same productivity benefits to your tests that you already know and love from writing your application's main code.\n\nStéphane Nicoll has a thing for code quality and robustness. He's been spreading the word for more than ten years while developing large scale Java enterprise applications in the geospatial, financial, or logistics sectors. An Apache Maven PMC member since 2006, he joined the core Spring Framework development team early 2014, being one of the main contributors to both Spring Framework and Spring Boot since. During his free time, he loves traveling around the world.\n\nAndy Wilkinson is a software developer on the Spring team at Pivotal where he's currently working on Spring Boot, Spring REST Docs, and the Spring IO Platform. When he's not working with server-side Java, Andy enjoys the different challenges presented by developing for iOS.\n\n[IJX-7017]"
