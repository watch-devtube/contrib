description: "? Registration to DevTernity is running! https://devternity.com\n\nThere are huge amount of different techniques and methodologies of self-organisation and personal effectiveness. However, most of them are flawed, because they do not take into account that the world is unpredictable, people are different and “knowing how to be effective” and “being affective” are not quite the same thing. In this talk, Maxim will show not “yet another personal effectiveness methodology” but the methodology that may help you to build your own one. Be ready to become more productive after this talk!"
