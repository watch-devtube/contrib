description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nSeptember 23, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Azriel Goldschmidt and Keith Beattie.\r\n\r\nThe South Pole, besides being an interesting place in its own right, is uniquely suited for Neutrino Astronomy and a challenging place to locate a cosmic ray detector and corresponding compute cluster. Azriel Goldschmit and Keith Beattie, respectively a particle physicist and computer systems engineer at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs, will present the physics motivation behind building a kilometer cube neutrino detector at the South Pole, go into some of the details of the data-acquisition system running there and describe travel to, work and life at the South Pole."
