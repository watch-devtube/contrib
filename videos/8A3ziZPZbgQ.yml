description: "Get the game: http://goo.gl/LWesG\n\nIn this video I continue my Java Asteroids game. I pretty much finish up the game in this tutorial.\n\nI show you how to do a bunch of new things. I show you how to play sound in a JFrame. We introduce yet another way to handle collision detection. We remove items from the screen when they are destroyed. And, a whole bunch more is covered."
