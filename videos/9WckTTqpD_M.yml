description: "Data is central to computing, and data security remains the biggest concern of application customers. Data needs to be handled securely at all stages, from transmission to computation and persistence. This presentation bootstraps you with the basics of applied cryptography, a choice of relevant algorithms, and the various secure data transport and storage options. It illustrates the trade-offs between cryptographic strength, performance, and storage size. It also covers the application of specialized hardware cryptographic processors for scenarios involving the most-stringent data security.\n\n\nAuthors:\nManish Maheshwari\nundefined\nView more trainings by Manish Maheshwari at https://www.parleys.com/author/manish-maheshwari\n\nAnirban Mukherjee\nAnirban Mukherjee is a Software Architect at Verisign and has over 15 years of industry experience designing and building large-scale applications.
