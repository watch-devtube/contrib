description: "Julien Simon (Amazon Web Services): Deep Learning on AWS with MXNet\n\nDeep learning continues to push the state of the art in domains such as computer vision, natural language understanding and recommendation engines. One of the key reasons for this progress is the availability of highly flexible and developer friendly deep learning frameworks. Apache MXNet is a fully-featured, flexibly-programmable and ultra-scalable deep learning framework supporting innovative deep models including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). After a quick overview of what Deep Leaning is, we will introduce you to GPU instances and to the Deep Learning AMI and of course, we’ll run several MXNet examples based on Python notebooks.\n\nThe speech was given on 2017-05-18 at infoShare 2017 (Tech Stage) in Gdańsk.\nhttp://infoshare.pl\n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
