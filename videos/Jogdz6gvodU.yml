language: English
recordingDate: 1429719886
description: 'This talk will provide a quick introduction to Docker images (build time), containers (run time), and registry (distribution). It shows how to take an existing Java EE application and package it as a monolithic application as a single Docker image. The application will then be refactored in to multiple microservices and assembled together using orchestration. Unit and integration testing of such applications will be discussed and shown as well. Design patterns and anti-patterns that show how to create cluster of such applications will be demonstrated and discussed.'
