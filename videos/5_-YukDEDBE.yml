Yeah, we thought it was awful too. That's why in late 2008, we set out to do something about. In this talk, I will discuss the three main concepts that helped us take our pages from slow to really fast. \n\nSlides for this talk can be seen here:\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/EdmundsLabs/how-edmunds-got-in-the-fast-lane-80-reduction-in-page-load-time-in-3-simple-steps-6593377\n\nLink to blog post:\nhttp://googlecode.blogspot.com/2010/11/edmunds-partners-with-google-to-make.html\n\nIsmail Elshareef's bio -\nIsmail has been a web engineer for over twelve years working on architecting and developing web applications and solutions for government, entertainment, media and automotive industries.
