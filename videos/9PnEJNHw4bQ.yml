description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016/andreas-loscher\n\nThis talk advocates the use of property-based testing in the area of sensor networks and presents a framework to apply this testing methodology. I will present a framework based on PropEr and Nifty that provides an expressive high-level language to specify a wide range of properties, starting from properties of individual functions to network-global properties, and infrastructure to automatically test these properties in Cooja, the network simulator of the Contiki operating system. I will show how we use this framework in practice on two case studies. In the first, we test whether the energy consumption of the radio duty-cycle protocol X-MAC is within some specific bound. In the second case study, we test the C API of CONTIKI's TCP socket library and find bugs in its event system that would be very hard to detect with other methods.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\nThis talk aims to demonstrate how property-based testing can be used to test sensor networks.\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- testers and developers"
