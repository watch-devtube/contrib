description: "The Open Source Community: its past and future What I learned about the Open Source Community while celebrating its 20th Anniversary around the World\nby Nick Vidal\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UB5.132/community_open_souce_community_past_and_future.webm\n\n\nThroughout the year of 2018, we celebrated the 20th Anniversary of Open Source. I'll provide an overview of what I've learned about the Open Source Community while celebrating its 20th Anniversary around the World. In 2018, the OSI has organized several activities at major open source events worldwide to celebrate it's 20th Anniversary. Events included Linux Conf Australia, FOSDEM, Campus Party, FOSSAsia, OpenExpo Europe, OW2con, FOSS Backstage, OSCON, Open Source Summit, All Things Open, and Mozilla Festival. \n\nAs part of the OSI, I was able to work behind the scenes, as well as travel around the world, to help with the activities. This has allowed me to meet and talk with several members of the Open Source community: to learn from them, to hear their stories, and to discuss our future. \n\nI hope to share some exciting insights from this experience! \n\nRoom: UB5.132\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:20:00+01"
