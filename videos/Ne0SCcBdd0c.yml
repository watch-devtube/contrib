title: 'Applied Domain-Driven Design Blueprints for Java EE'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433259184
description: "Domain-driven design (DDD) promises to simplify enterprise application development and is gradually gaining traction as an alternative to traditional four-tier architectures originally popularized by J2EE. As the name implies, DDD is an architectural approach that strongly focuses on materializing the business domain in software. This session demonstrates firsthand how DDD can be implemented with Java EE via a project named Cargo Tracker. Part of Java EE BluePrints, Cargo Tracker seamlessly maps concepts such as bounded contexts, layered architectures, entities, value objects, aggregates, services, repositories, and factories to realistic code examples.\n\n\nAuthors:\nReza Rahman\nReza Rahman is a long time former independent consultant and now officially a Java EE/GlassFish evangelist at Oracle.
