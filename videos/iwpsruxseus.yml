description: "Cloud Foundry 101 for Kubernetes Users - Steffen Uhlig, IBM & Oleksandr Slynko, Pivotal\n\nThis talk will take Kubernetes users from “zero to hero” with Cloud Foundry. Kubernetes is fantastic, but since you are at CF Summit you are probably tempted by the Cloud Foundry promise of letting you “just push code” and not worry about the details of containers, and scheduling, and scaling. But Cloud Foundry does still have a learning curve -- this talk is here to help you over it!\n\nKubernetes is meant to be used by operators, not developers. Developers shouldn’t need to care about the inner workings of Kubernetes such as Pods, Services, StatefulSets, Ingresses and how to use and configure them just to get their application running, right? This is where Cloud Foundry comes in.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore what Kubernetes users need to know when using Cloud Foundry. We’ll get familiar with CF's own container scheduler -Diego- and its differences with Kubernetes. We will also look at how, using Eirini, you can get up and running with CF on your existing Kubernetes cluster with a couple of helm installs. And we’ll compare, hands-on, the effort it takes to bring up an application from scratch in both Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes and see it running in the cloud!\n\nAbout Oleksandr Slynko\nOleksandr is Staff Software Engineer at Pivotal. He works on project Eirini. Before that he worked on Cloud Foundry Container Runtime and related projects for more than two years. Oleksandr has a background in automation and working on high available cloud solutions.\n\nAbout Steffen Uhlig\nSteffen is a Senior Software Engineer at IBM Research and Development near Stuttgart, Germany. Besides working on Eirini, he is also a member of the postgres-release team. Steffen also served as the first anchor of the bits-service, where a large set of operations was extracted from the Cloud Controller. While he is still a Ruby enthusiast, Steffen also enjoyed spending some time in the Garden team. His spare time is reserved for his wife, two kids, and a cat."
