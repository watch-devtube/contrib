recordingDate: 1433246331
description: "Created by Aldebaran Robotics, the NAO is a 58-centimeter-tall humanoid robot with 25 degrees of freedom, designed to be fully and easily programmable. This presentation first introduces its basic software and hardware architecture and then shows how to develop applications with the Java SDK: to develop either a brain for your robot in pure Java or a remote controller for an Android device.\n\n\nAuthors:\nErwan Pinault\nErwan Pinault is a French Java engineer working at Aldebaran Robotics on the NaoQi Java SDK. Before that, he worked on several traffic alert mobile apps (iCoyote on Android Parrot’s car radio, Renault R-Link system). As a java engineer, he also developed J2EE REST stateless backends for major automotive industry players such as BMW, Renault, Porsche and Mercedes. In his free-time, he enjoys sharing his Android expertise and skills for application development projects in embedded and real-time environments.\nView more trainings by Erwan Pinault at https://www.parleys.com/author/erwan-pinault-1\n\nNicolas Rigaud\nI work with humanoid robots and Im doing fine, thanks!\nView more trainings by Nicolas Rigaud at https://www.parleys.com/author/nicolas-rigaud-2\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
