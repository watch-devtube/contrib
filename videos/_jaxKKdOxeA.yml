description: "This talk was recorded at CukenFest London 2018\n\nhttp://cukenfest.cucumber.io/\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe invest so much in technology, so why do we seem to get so little benefit in return? We introduce new processes, tools and methods, but when you stand back and squint the organisation still looks just the same.\n\nIs technology over-hyped and oversold, as many would have us believe, or are we doing something that means we lose out on all those promised benefits? Societies work because we follow the rules, but what if those same rules are holding us back? The problem may not be in the technology, but in us failing to change our habits.\n\nIn this talk, Dan introduces some uncomfortable truths from Eliyahu Goldratt, author of “The Goal” and one of the fathers of modern management theory, that may help us to recognise and challenge this behaviour so we can start to get the real benefit from all that technology.\n\nSlides - https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/how-to-break-the-rules-cucumber-mix"
