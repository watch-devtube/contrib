description: "Bringing Kubernetes To Bare-Metal With A Focus On Users - Nicolas Trangez, Scality \n\nWhen the team at Scality looked for options to deploy Kubernetes on-prem, we found no option focusing on ease of operations and local storage provisioning. We released MetalK8s, an “opinionated” K8s distribution with a focus on users: easy long-term, on-prem deployments. The project is open source and in production at customers, used as a foundation to deploy Scality’s products. MetalK8s is based on the Kubespray project to reliably install a base Kubernetes cluster, including all dependencies (like etcd), using Ansible. V1.0 ships with operational tools for monitoring and metering, including Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch and Kibana. Furthermore, an \"ingress controller\" is deployed by default, based on Nginx. All managed as Helm packages. Unlike hosted Kubernetes solutions, We focus on managing node-local storage and exposing these volumes to containers managed in the cluster. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrYG"
