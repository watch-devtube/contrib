description: "Developing a game takes much time and cost a lot of money, so not \ntrue. Developing a game, requires that you to like playing games (you \nwill have to do it, a lot!), \nhaving some coding skills and having some free time to do it.\n\nI would like to share my experience of picking the right framework, \ntooling, finding resources like images and sound effects. \nOr event better, how to create your own images and sound effects (I \ndid it, I am not a designer nor audio expert, and so can you). \nAfter having all the resources, how to put peaces together and finally \nhave your game published on Play Store. \nPutting a game on Google Play is just a new beginning, in a flood of \nnew games, how will anyone notice your game?"
