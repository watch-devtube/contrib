description: "Tim 'mithro' Ansell\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/52/\nPython is generally considered a high level language a long way from hardware, this very fact actually makes it an awesome tool for helping out with the design and creation of hardware!\r\n\r\nPython was essential in developing the HDMI2USB.tv open source firmware and hardware for video capture. The system has been in use since late 2015 and used at numerous conferences such as Linux.conf.au, DebConf and numerous PyCon conferences around the world.\r\n\r\nThis talk will hopefully cover;\r\n\r\n  * Python hardware description languages (HDLs) for creating \"gateware\" for FPGA chips or even real IC design.\r\n  * Python scripting for hardware schematic layout and design rule checking.\r\n  * Python tools for deploying, programming and debugging embedded systems.\r\n  * Some cool projects like HDMI2USB.tv project.\r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on open source tools."
