description: "Connecting Things Together, an IoT Data Protocol Story - Dave McAllister, Solace\n\nThe Internet of Things is rapidly becoming the Internet of Everything. And with that comes massive scale up in data and in messages being generated and delivered for analysis and machine learning. Such scale issues require an understanding of the various wire protocols in use for IoT and for the applications being fed. Without data movement, IoT is meaningless.\n\nSo, how do you deal with moving IoT messages into Cloud Foundry?\n\nDave will help you understand the pros and cons of relevant protocols by demonstrating a simple IoT scenario: A particulate sensor connected to an Arduino Uno that sends MQTT messages into a message router that passes them along to Pivotal Cloud Foundry using REST. \n\nFrom there, he’ll look at the protocol requirements of a microservices architecture within Cloud Foundry, including considerations of JMS and AMQP. Dave will finish up with a discussion on the emerging multi-cloud and hybrid cloud (public to private to datacenter) architectures and why your data needs to flow where you need it when you need it, in the form that best fits the use case.\n\nAbout Dave McAllister\nDave McAllister has been a champion for open systems and open source from the early days of Linux, through open distributed file systems like XFS, GFS and GlusterFS to today’s world of clouds and containers. In his current role, Dave is working with messaging/streaming developers and architects to promote the use of open standard data movement protocols and APIs to solve large-scale distributed systems challenges. Dave sits on the Linux Journal Reader Advisory Board, won a Golden Penguin in 2002 and was recently named as one of the top ten pioneers in open source by Computer Business Review. Talk to Dave about photography, cats, food and wine."
