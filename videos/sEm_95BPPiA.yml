description: Despite being very new, spring boot has seen a spectacular start as an
  amazing kickstarter for spring-based application. You can now start your project
  in a matter of minutes, not days! On the other hand, you're still using Java, with
  all its ceremony regarding code... Wouldn't it be great if we could pair Spring
  Boot with a powerful yet simple language? In this talk, I'll live code a Spring
  Boot application using Kotlin, the friendly language provided by JetBrains. Come
  discover how you can now cut through all the red tape and finally focus only the
  important stuff.
