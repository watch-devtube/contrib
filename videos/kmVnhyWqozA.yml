description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nTrisha Gee - Developer at MongoDB\n\nABSTRACT\nIt seems to have been a common theme amongst startups to create the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in a language that facilitates rapid prototyping (for example Ruby), and then migrate to the JVM when the application has proved itself and requires more in terms of stability and performance. \n\nI'm going to demonstrate that it's possible to use a static, boiler-plate-heavy language like Java to create a web application in under and hour, in front of your very eyes. The JVM is a true polyglot platform, and I'm going to show how you can use it to utilise the correct tools for each job, including: angular.js; bootstrap; HTML 5; micro-services; Java-the-language; MongoDB; and Groovy - a fully buzz-word-compliant application. While I won't go into each technology in depth. by seeing how the application is put together you'll get an understanding of the role of each technology and how they work together. \n\nYes, live coding, with all attendant danger. \n\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
