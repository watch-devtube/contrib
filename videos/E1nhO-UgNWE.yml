description: "Speaker: Daniel Sim\n\nQuestion: How a group of data scientists spotted and recognized the trail of destruction on the Circle Line left by a rogue train? \n\nBlog post: https://blog.data.gov.sg/how-we-caught-the-circle-line-rogue-train-with-data-79405c86ab6a\n\nPresentation will include: \n- Exploratory analysis used \n- How the hypothesis of a single rogue train was formed and tested \n- Challenges faced\n\nDaniel Sim did his Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge (2013) and Masters at ETH Zurich (2015). In 2014, he worked on one of the algorithms underlying Beeline as an intern and is currently assisting helping Beeline get past the fledgling state. He is a strong believer in D-R-Y and believes in aggressively automating away any repetitive tasks.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/DataScience-SG-Singapore/events/236765445/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/30RL/"
