description: "As communications become more complicated, the amount of bits required to succesfully correct an error increases, but by how much? Professor Brailsford talks multi-dimensional parity bits. \n\nProfessor Brailsford's earlier videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzH6n4zXuckpKAj1_88VS-8Z6yn9zX_P6\n\nSpecial thanks to Prof Ray Hill, \nUniversity of Salford UK for much consultancy and advice. \n\nApologies for the typo in the title of this video. \n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\n\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: http://bit.ly/nottscomputer\n\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.
