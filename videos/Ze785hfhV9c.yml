description: "Keynote: Blockhead Service Broker: From Hackathon to CF Extensions–\_Swetha Repakula, Software Engineer & Nima Kaviani, Senior Cloud Engineer, IBM\n\nDeploying and developing smart contracts is a complicated task. A developer not only needs to understand and implement the logic of a contract, but also know how to setup and integrate their nodes to a network. With configuration and management differing by network, the learning curve for a polyglot blockchain developers is quite steep.\n\nPaaS aim to hide the complexities of the IaaS and allow cloud application developers to focus solely on their application logic. We believe the same analogy can and should be applied to blockchain application developers.\n\nWe will demonstrate how the Blockhead broker facilitates the process of developing DApps independent of the blockchain network used.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/Fq4A/keynote-blockhead-service-broker-from-hackathon-to-cf-extensions-swetha-repakula-software-engineer-nima-kaviani-senior-cloud-engineer-ibm"
