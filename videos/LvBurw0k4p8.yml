title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2015 Mark Hibberd - Failure: Or the Unexpected Virtue of Functional Programming'
recordingDate: 1514641398
description: "Even correct software fails.\n\nSo what happens if we shift the focus of functional programming to reliable systems? Let’s attack the hard and ugly set of programming problems, the solutions that don’t naturally fall out from building a neat library. Let’s apply our functional programming toolkit to delivering systems end-to-end.\n\nThis is a talk on reliable systems. What it takes to build them, how functional programming can and is being leveraged, and perhaps of more interest, where current approaches are letting us down.\n\nMark Hibberd spends his time working on large-scale data and machine learning problems for Ambiata. Mark takes software development seriously. Valuing correctness and reliability, he is constantly looking to learn tools and techniques to support these goals.\n\nThis approach has led to a history of building teams that utilise purely-functional programming techniques to help deliver robust products.\n\nFor more on YOW!
