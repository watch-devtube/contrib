title: 'STS in Ceph Object Storage'

description: "by Pritha Srivastava\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.1308/sds_ceph_sts_in_object_storage.webm\n\nCeph is an open source, highly scalable, software defined storage that provides object, file and block interfaces under a unified system. Ceph Object Storage Gateway (RGW) provides a RESTful object storage interface to the Ceph Storage cluster. It provides an interface that is compatible with a large subset of AWS S3 APIs.\n\n\nIn this talk we discuss the implementation of a subset of the APIs of AWS Secure Token Service (STS). AWS STS is a web service which enables identity federation and cross-account access by providing temporary security credentials.\n\n\nCeph Object Storage Gateway now supports some APIs of AWS STS particularly related to web identity federation and cross-account access. The advantages of these temporary credentials are that they automatically expire after a certain duration, provide limited access (via IAM policies) to resources, are provided to the user upon request, and obviate the need for users/ applications to save permanent security credentials thereby removing a potential security loophole.\n\n\nAs an example consider a web application that has users and needs access to RGW S3 buckets to read/ write large files. The application can delegate identity management to a trusted third party identity provider(IDP). It can get temporary credentials from STS after authenticating with the IDP and access the required RGW S3 buckets.\nOutline of the talk:\n\n\n❮ol❯\n❮li❯Introduction to Ceph and Ceph Object Storage Gateway❮/li❯\n❮li❯Current authentication mechanisms in Ceph Object Storage Gateway❮/li❯\n❮li❯AWS Secure Token Service❮/li❯\n❮li❯STS APIs implemented in Ceph Object Storage❮/li❯\n❮li❯Advantages of using STS❮/li❯\n❮li❯Example❮/li❯\n❮li❯Future Work❮/li❯\n❮/ol❯\n\n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 08:00:00"
