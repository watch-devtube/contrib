title: 'Code generation with Javac Plugin (Oleksandr Radchykov, Ukraine)'
recordingDate: 1468311422
description: 'Javac plugin API was introduced in java 8. We can use this API for getting cool things done (like code generation/code analyzing). However it is not widely used right now. Most of `java magic` projects like Lombok, Java-OO are using annotation processing. I want to show brand new approach for making the magic in java which has some benefits. Right now I have prototype which gives us the power of auto type casting in java and, if you want to use it, you shouldn’t add any dependencies to your project for using it, you should only add flag for compiler. In future I think it can be done through build tool plugin.'
