description: "Fred Bricon, Principal Software Engineer, Red Hat\n\nVisual Studio Code (vscode) is a very popular, extensible open source coding editor that provides support for multiple programming languages via the Language Server Protocol (LSP). Java support is provided by the Eclipse jdt.ls server, implementing LSP. The combination of vscode and jdt.ls represents a refreshing perspective on the IDE landscape, combining the speed of a lightweight editor with the richness of a mature Java IDE (Eclipse). This presentation, after providing an introduction to LSP and the jdt.ls architecture, dives into the development workflow of a simple Spring Boot application. From code completion and code lenses to debugging and annotation processing, the audience will come away with something to be excited about."
