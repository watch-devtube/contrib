description: "Speaker(s):\nMandy Waite, Weston Hutchins\n\nDescription:\nHow do you make your cloud applications fast? For the past 15 years, Google have been developing tools and techniques for building fast cloud based services - something that we like to think of as 'Google-Fast'.  In this session we'll look at how we build Google Search, Google Maps and Gmail to be Google-Fast. We'll demonstrate how you can apply much of what we've learned to building your own fast cloud services and applications using the tools and services available to you with Google Cloud Platform. We'll provide deeper insight on how to get the best performance out of all of your cloud resources, from Persistent Disk performance to Cloud Datastore writes and beyond. You'll leave this session fully equipped to design and build Google-Fast cloud applications on Google Cloud Platform.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
