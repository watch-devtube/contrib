description: "Title: Remote device sign in – Authenticating without a keyboard \n\nWhen we were developing our SoundCloud app for Xbox One, something became very obvious during usability testing: signing in with a game controller really sucks. Entering text requires navigating a virtual keyboard to individual letters, numbers, and characters one at a time – such a nightmare! Other connected devices are even more extreme, with no way to enter text at all. Learn how to implement what we call “remote device sign-in”, a way for people to sign in to devices with limited input capability that is secure, simple, and fast."
