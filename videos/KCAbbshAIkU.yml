description: "Software differentiates you from your competitors, and the speed by which you deliver new capability determines if you win or lose in today’s competitive market.  If your development and test teams are currently measuring software build and test times in terms of hours or (gulp) days rather than in minutes, then you're at risk of falling behind the competition. Don’t waste time waiting for software builds, static analysis, or automated unit testing to complete. \n\nIn this session you will learn how ElectricAccelerator, Electric Cloud’s build and test acceleration platform can:\n• Speed up Continuous Integration efforts by 20x-40x\n• Better utilize your build and test infrastructure\n• Improve developer and tester productivity"
