description: "DevConf - The Software Craftsmen Festival for Sharing Knowledge and Inspiration (https://devconf.pl/)\n\nREST APIs aren't dead - in fact they're more alive than ever. Don't let the hype around GraphQL put you off - RESTful APIs are being built and used by developers all over the world and that isn't changing anytime soon.\n\nBefore you start with File - New Project, however, there are some key decisions to be made about your API. Who is the main consumer? How will you authenticate? Who will own the documentation? How will you test it? How will you deploy it?\n\nIn other words, how will you manage the (probably very long) lifecycle of your REST API?\n\nJoin Spencer as he walks you through some of the decision making processes that you'll go through when building a REST API from the ground up. He'll offer advice as a designer of REST APIs of all shapes and sizes, for many different kinds of consumers, and share some of the many lessons learned over the years. Finally, we'll walk through some of the technical considerations you'll make when your developers finally sit down and start developing your API."
