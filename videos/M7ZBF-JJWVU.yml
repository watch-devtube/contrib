description: "Mike Coleman - Technology Evangelist, Docker\n\nYour developers just walked into your cube and said \"here's the new app, I built it with Docker, and it's ready to go live\". What do you do next? In this session we'll talk about what containers are and what they are not. And we'll step through a series of considerations that need to be examined when deploying containerized workloads - VMs or Container? Bare Metal or Cloud? What about capacity planning? Security? Disaster Recovery? How do I even get started?"
