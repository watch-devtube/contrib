title: 'YOW! 2014 Mark Hibberd - Programming in the Large: Architecture and Experimentation'
recordingDate: 1514469195
description: "Building robust, quality systems is hard. We trade off organizational issues against technical decisions; the ability to deliver quickly against our ability to change; and the ability to build systems easily against the ability to run those systems in production. However, good architectural decisions can free us to choose the right tools and techniques, allowing us to manage these challenges and concentrate on solving real problems rather than our made up ones.\n\nIn this talk, we will run through some stereotypical projects, come to terms with legacy systems, and look at the properties of robust architectures. In particular we are interested in how architectures lend themselves to experimentation and change in terms of both function and technology.\n\nWe will attempt to ground the discussion with examples from my past projects. Looking at where things have worked well and probably of more interest, where they really have not.\n\nMark Hibberd spends his time working on large-scale data and machine learning problems for Ambiata. Mark takes software development seriously. Valuing correctness and reliability, he is constantly looking to learn tools and techniques to support these goals.\n\nThis approach has led to a history of building teams that utilise purely-functional programming techniques to help deliver robust products.\n\nFor more on YOW!
