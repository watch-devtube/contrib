Even more enticing is the promise of elusive nuggets of market research and competitive intelligence out there waiting to be discovered -- IF you know how to wield Google.\r\n\r\nNeurologists estimate that we humans use a mere 1% of our mental capacity. Similarly, the majority of our search queries are surprisingly unsophisticated and thus the true power of the Google search engine, for most of us, remains untapped.\r\n\r\nLearn how you too can become an expert Google searcher and extract invaluable data about your competitors and about the market like never before -- with laser-like accuracy and extreme efficiency.\r\n\r\nYou will learn:\r\n\r\nHow to cut through the clutter with Boolean logic, exact phrase matching, wildcards, and search operators like filetype, intitle, site, and \"daterange\"\r\nHow to cast a wider net by expanding your search to include synonyms with the ~ (tilde) operator.\r\nHow to conduct specialized searches using Google's many search sites like Google News, Google Groups, and Google Blog Search.\r\nHow to obtain real, confidential business plans and marketing plans\r\nHow to invoke the Google search box as a phonebook, a calculator, a measurement converter, a dictionary, a package tracker, an airline timetable, a street map atlas, and a stock ticker.\r\n\r\nAbout Stephan Spencer:\r\nStephan Spencer is founder and President of the highly-respected SEO firm Netconcepts.
