title: '#DataScience Александр Калинин. Deep Learning for Automatic Pneumonia Detection'
language: English
recordingDate: 1616474935
description: "Pneumonia is the leading cause of death among young children and one of the top mortality causes worldwide. The pneumonia detection is usually performed through examine of chest X-Ray radiograph by highly-trained specialists. This process is tedious and often leads to a disagreement between radiologists. Computer-aided diagnostic systems showed the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. In this work, we develop the computational approach for pneumonia regions detection based on single-shot detectors, squeeze-and-exitation deep convolution neural networks, augmentations and multi-task learning. The proposed approach was evaluated in the context of the Radiological Society of North America Pneumonia Detection Challenge, achieving one of the best results in the challenge.\n\nАудитория и уровень:\nResearchers, Data Scientists, Healthcare professionals.\n\nПрезентация на Я.Диске: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/ZXOn7JmkCqm-gg\n\nCodeFest O! https://o.codefest.ru/lecture/1690"
