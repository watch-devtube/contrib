description: "PyData NYC 2018\n\nIn this talk, I will argue that the computer metaphor is the wrong one for understanding cognition and behavior. I will show how to construct alternative explanations using dynamical systems theory and the PyData stack. Finally, I will demonstrate some applications of behavioral dynamics in sports medicine and sports analytics.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
