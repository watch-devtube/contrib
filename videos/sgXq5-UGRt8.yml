recordingDate: 1528195970
description: "The explosive growth of serverless technologies has radically changed how we think about and design applications. No longer are we spending our precious development time with infrastructure, instead we get to focus on making unique and powerful applications.\n\nThis talk will focus on how to use AWS's serverless technologies for .NET developers. You will learn how to use services like AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway to run your .NET code and use AWS's serverless storage services like Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB. This talk will have plenty of code examples showing you how to go from Visual Studio to a serverless application running in AWS in minutes."
