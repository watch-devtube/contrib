description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nWhat's Oracle doing with JavaScript?\n\nAt JavaOne/OpenWorld 2015, Oracle announced that its own internal developers have been using JavaScript for several years to develop Cloud applications and that a toolkit built up out of open source solutions is being made available for general use. Data in the Cloud needs to be visualized in interesting and understandable ways, which is the key reason for the existence of Oracle JET (Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit). It provides JQuery UI components that make available graphs, charts, and similar components, on top of Require.js for modularity, Knockout.js for data binding, and more. The entire toolkit will be open sourced. Come to this code-driven session to find out what Oracle is doing with JavaScript and how you can leverage these solutions too!\n\nGeertjan Wielenga, Oracle\n\nGeertjan Wielenga lives in Amsterdam and works for Oracle on open source projects. He is an enterprise technology enthusiast, evangelist, trainer, speaker, and writer, primarily focused on new trends in Java and JavaScript, together with tooling provided by the NetBeans ecosystem.
