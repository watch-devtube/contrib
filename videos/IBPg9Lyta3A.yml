description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune, 13 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe Internet is overrun with spam: Recent estimates suggest that spam\nconstitutes about 95% of all email traffic. Beyond simply being a\nnuisance, spam exhausts network resources and can also serve as a\nvector for other types of attacks, including phishing attacks and\nonline scams. Conventional approaches to stopping these types of\nattacks typically rely on a combination of the reputation of a\nsender's IP address and the contents of the message. Unfortunately,\nthese features are brittle. Spammers can easily change the IP\naddresses from which they send spam and the content that they use as\nthe \"cover medium\" for the email message itself. In this talk, I will\ndescribe a new, complementary approach to stopping unwanted email\ntraffic on the Internet: Rather than classifying spam based on either\nthe content of the message or the identity of the sender, we classify\nemail messages based on how the spam is being sent and the properties\nof the spamming infrastructure. I will first summarize the highlights\nof a 13-month study of the network-level behavior of spammers using\ndata from a large spam trap. I will then describe a new approach to\nspammer classification called \"behavioral blacklisting\" and present a\ndetailed study of network-level features that can be used to identify\nspammers. Often these features can classify a spammer on the first\npacket received from that sender, without even receiving the message.\nI will conclude by describing our plans to incorporate these\nalgorithms into a next-generation sender reputation system, as well as\nour ongoing study of the online scam hosting infrastructure, whose\nproperties may also ultimately prove useful for identifying unwanted\ntraffic.\n\nThis talk includes joint work with Anirudh Ramachandran, Nadeem Syed,\nMaria Konte, Santosh Vempala, Jaeyeon Jung, and Alex Gray.\n\n\nSpeaker: Nick Feamster\nNick Feamster is an assistant professor in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. He received his Ph.D. in Computer science from MIT in 2005, and his S.B. and M.Eng. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in 2000 and 2001, respectively. His research focuses on many aspects of computer networking and networked systems, including the design, measurement, and analysis of network routing protocols, network operations and security, and anonymous communication systems. His honors include a Sloan Research Fellowship, the NSF CAREER award, the IBM Faculty Fellowship, and award papers at SIGCOMM 2006 (network-level behavior of spammers), the NSDI 2005 conference (fault detection in router configuration), Usenix Security 2002 (circumventing web censorship using Infranet), and Usenix Security 2001 (web cookie analysis)."
