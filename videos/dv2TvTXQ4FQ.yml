description: "SVGs, with their potential for high-quality and performant graphics, have myriad uses on the web. By now, a lot of developers are aware of their practical uses, such as small and accessible icons, or illustrations. In this session, though, Sarah will go beyond typical use cases. She’ll cover a few practical things like styling SVG icons like typography, and then dive into the creative wilds of this graphic format built with math. She’ll make it respond to physics, make it bounce and snap, stack it like legos for responsive, and make it interactive with front-end frameworks like Vue.js and React. In this session Sarah will push the boundaries of what’s possible while also thinking about cross-browser stability, and you’ll come out of it with a whole new world of tools in your front-end developer toolbox.\n\nEVENT: Full Stack Fest 2017\n\nSPEAKER: Sarah Drasner\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on Codegram Technologies YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADXX4fmWHbo&t=1864s"
