description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nProbabilistic programming frameworks get a lot of press, but relatively little attention is paid to the indicators that a problem is a good fit for a Bayesian approach, how to pick a framework, or the right first steps to structuring a probabilistic model. This talk aims at building a structural underpinning for Bayesian modeling and lays out concrete strategies for solving real world problems.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
