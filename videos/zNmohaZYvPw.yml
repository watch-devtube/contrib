description: "Google I/O 2010 - Casting a wide net: How to target all Android devices \r\n\r\nAndroid 201 \r\n\r\nJustin Mattson \r\n\r\nOne of Android's strengths is its flexibility to run on a wide variety of devices. In this session, we will explore the facilities the Android resource system provides to developers to make supporting many devices from one application binary easier, as well as common pitfalls. In addition to hardware heterogeneity, more than one version of Android may exist in the wild at any given time. We will go over strategies for providing cross-version compatibility. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
