recordingDate: 1535544486
description: "In this talk, top ranked white-hat hacker Frans Rosén will focus on methodologies and results of attacking modern web technologies. He will explain how he accessed private Slack tokens by using postMessage and WebSocket-reconnect, and how vulnerable configurations in both AWS and Google Cloud allow attackers to take full control of your assets. \nListen to 60 minutes of new hacks, bug bounty stories and learnings that will make you realize that the protocols and policies you believed to be secure are most likely not."
