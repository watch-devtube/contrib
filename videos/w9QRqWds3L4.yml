recordingDate: 1511888598
description: "Technology for Technology Leaders\n\nKen McKnight, Solutions Architect, Electric Cloud \n\nIn DevOps, data is ubiquitous. We use data not only to manage our applications and environments, but also to guide our DevOps journey, align our culture, track our business impact, optimize our pipeline and processes, accelerate incident response, and more.\n\nData is everywhere in DevOps. Often, the challenges with the exponential growth of DevOps metrics is how to make this data actionable. How to make these insights immediate, and even automated (versus something we only realize 6 months later, when we’re done crunching the numbers...). As a prerequisite to enable this, we also need to also figure out how do we make data collection less painful.\n\nWe know there’s a lot of data, and a lot you can do with it. Where to start?\n\nRecognizing that you’re probably already “sitting” on a few common data streams that you can put into good use – this talk focuses on 4 key use cases and best practices that you can take advantage of today for data-driven DevOps around:\n\n1. Alignment and impact of your DevOps adoption - what to measure along the pipeline, how to collect and centrally store appropriate data, and leveraging visualization techniques to quickly communicate status at all levels of the organization. \n2. Creating Smart Pipelines that automatically respond to input for ensuring quality, performance, security, and more\n3. Incident response 2.0\n4. DevOps infrastructure optimization\n\nLearn patterns and best practices for automating data collection, analysis, visibility and triggered actions that you can use with your current infrastructure and tooling - to take your data-driven DevOps to the next level.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
