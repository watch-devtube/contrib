In this presentation, Vadim discusses the motivations for building BOSH and the goals for the project, as well as outlining its role in deploying and managing CloudFoundry.com. He then quickly delved into the details, outlining some of the artifacts used in BOSH as well as detailing the architecture of a full-scale BOSH deployment.'
