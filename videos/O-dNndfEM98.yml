description: 'It’s pretty clear that today’s politics are broken. It’s time for us to reinvent deliberation about hard issues. pol.is, Colin’s company, has already helped Taiwan develop groundbreaking regulations for on-demand transportation, regulations that brought together the public, cities, and the on-demand companies themselves in a productive conversation. We’re now looking to bring this approach to a variety of contentious issues of technology and society here in the US.'
