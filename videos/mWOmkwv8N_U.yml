description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nNew developers starting out with C++ nearly universally hit a brick wall - it's very hard to start programming and get something working. Unlike other languages such as Java, NodeJS, Rust and Python, where a standard package manager and build system take care of these problems for you, C++ has all the ability and variation under the sun to create nearly anything - if you've understood how to make the tools do what you want them to. \n\nThings don't need to be so complicated. Nearly always, the things you're making aren't as complicated as the tools allow you to express. There is a good reason why C++ build systems are so complicated though, but it's not one that requires them to be. In this talk we'll explore the design space for build tools (with a focus on C++) and discover a simpler way of building software.\n— \nPeter Bindels, TomTom\nPrincipal Software Engineer\n\nPeter is a C++ developer known for writing HippoMocks and cpp-dependencies, and less well known for encouraging C++ both for beginners and for uncommon target areas (OS development, embedded, server-side). He likes to rethink the basics of what we take for granted to see if new ideas emerge, and to see where previously-old ideas are now new discoveries.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
