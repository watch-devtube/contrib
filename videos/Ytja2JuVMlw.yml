title: 'Why Java and the JVM Will Dominate the Future of Machine Learning, AI, and Big Data'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540404949
description: "Bernard Traversat, Vice President of Software Development, Java SE Platform , Oracle\n\nJava and the JVM are the leading big data runtime within the enterprise. The gigantic demands of new machine learning, AI, and big data workloads are pushing the limit of scale and performance beyond what current leading ML/AI platforms can scale to. Java and the JVM have historically been the runtime of choice for developers looking at massive scale, robustness, and performance. This session discusses several new innovations in the Java language and JVM to address new machine learning and AI workloads at scale (JIT compilation, data layout, data access, GC latency, off-heap management, native OS interactions, crypto support and startup) and presents upcoming improvements in the platform. It also covers the leading Java and JVM-based ML and AI libraries."
