description: "Frank Munz, Director, munz & more\n\nThis presentation is hands-on, engaging, and entertaining, with just a few slides and mostly live demos. After a quick introduction to Docker, it looks into scalability, the overhead of Docker containers, and how to get Oracle products prebuilt from Docker Registry. The main part of the demonstration dives into Docker Swarm shown on a Raspi-based cluster, contrasts this with a Kubernetes solution, and then shows live why Oracle Container Cloud Service and Wercker can be a much easier solution for many workloads."
