description: "Google Tech Talk\nMay 30, 2015\n(\"show more\" for more information)\nPresented by Mathieu Boespflug\n\nhttps://wiki.haskell.org/ZuriHac2015#Mathieu_Boespflug\n\nABSTRACT\n\nShifting from building compilers and desktop applications to online services and mobile apps means that Haskell programming is increasingly about building systems, not standalone data-in data-out contraptions. Systems that are distributed across anything from a handful to millions of machines. We'll look at what Haskell has to offer for building robust and scalable distributed systems, starting from the paradigms popularized in other languages to more idiomatic, safe and composable models.\n\nSlides for this talk are available here:\nhttps://github.com/meiersi/HaskellerZ/blob/master/meetups/20150530-ZuriHac2015_Mathieu_Boespflug-Distributed_Programming/ZuriHac15%20talk-%20distributed%20haskell.pdf"
