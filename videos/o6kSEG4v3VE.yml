description: 'Java containers appeared back in the era of big expensive hardware and monolithic applications, and currently feel like an impediment to Java progress. More and more developers opt out of containers in favor of runnable jars, especially with the advance of microservices architectures. Andrus Adamchik will present a new open source tool called Bootique (https://bootique.io), a pluggable and extensible technology intended for various kinds of container-less Java apps – REST services, webapps, job runners, desktop apps and what not.'
