description: 'With Cloud Native technologies like orchestration, we don''t necessarily know which machine a piece of code will run on. With containers-as-a-service and other serverless technologies, we don''t even get access to the machines. What does this mean for security, and what properties of (containerised) microservices can help us keep our software safe - or at least safer - from attacks?'
