He has studied Mathematics and Business Administration. He  loves math and applies it in programming language extensions.\n\nBroaden Scala\n\nSyntax matters: ideally code is concise and easy to write and read. Scala is at the right track and it supports internal DSLs, but there is much room for improvement by rethinking. We propose a set of superficial language modifications aiming at reducing boilerplate code, text repetitions and parentheses. Dataflow arrows may replace verbose match and catch constructs. Also we propose a way to ease creating DSLs that mix well with Scala, with clear language region borders and shared AST element types.\n\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2018/andre-van-delft"
