It is a hot topic in the JavaScript community.\nIn this talk, we will briefly explore what a PWA is and how to build one. We will look at the benefits of PWA's and more importantly their limitations.\nWe then look a bit deeper at the technologies behind PWA's such as Service Workers, in particular we will look at the mechanics behind Service Workers, and how they will affect your back-end builds.\nFinally, we will look at offline development, the offline first life-cycle and the tools and technologies needed to start building offline applications. Comparing offline storage mechanisms, and their limitations.\nThis talk is great for anyone building web-based applications, in any language, or anyone wanting to learn more about PWA's and offline development\n\nEVENT:\n\nthe Dutch PHP Conference in 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMike Oram\n\nPERMISSSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZrEYJ_DKQc"
