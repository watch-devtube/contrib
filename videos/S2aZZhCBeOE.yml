The best part is live instruction, with playback. You get all the presentations and labs. Great instructions. But my favorite feature is viewing a previous class. They provide a set of videos from a previous session, so you can watch the course before you participate. This way you can get the most out of the course. I have taken so many courses and then not really gotten to work with a technology until I forgot most of what was taught. Edureka lets you go back later, when your boss says \"I want this ASAP!\" ~ This is the killer education app... I've take two courses, and I'm taking two more. Love these guys. \""
