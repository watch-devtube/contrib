description: "Get the Code : http://bit.ly/Cplus7\nBest C++ Book : https://amzn.to/2Iof70Y\nhttps://www.patreon.com/derekbanas\n\nIn this tutorial we continue solving problems with C++. We'll solve the Caesar Cipher, Solve Equations for X, Create Lists of Primes and Generate a List of Random Values in a Range. I'm making these videos to make you good at solving random problems rather then just covering language syntax. Don't worry if you get them wrong. The goal is to make you think in new ways."
