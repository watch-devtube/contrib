title: 'Put a Firewall in Your JVM, Securing Java Applications'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433233447
description: "Java and the JVM itself have not had the greatest reputation for security, even though the majority of reported issues are on the client. Security is an increasingly important issue, and exploits can exist not only in the JVM and our own code but also in the frameworks, application servers, and JAR files we use. This session looks at the architecture of the JVM itself and investigates where the weaknesses in that architecture lie. It also looks at various ways exploits have taken advantage of this architecture. Finally, it examines a new approach to Java security that, for the first time, enables us to secure Java applications before patches are available and takes a firewall right up to the application itself.\n\n\nAuthors:\nDebbie Fuller\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Debbie Fuller at https://www.parleys.com/author/debbie-fuller\n\n Prateep Bandharangshi\nPrateep Bandharangshi is director of client security solutions for Waratek.
