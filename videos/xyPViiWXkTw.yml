description: "Luc Duponcheel\nprogrammer and cyclist, co-founder Strong[Typed]​\n\nPhD Mathematics (University Brussels)\n\nFunctional Programming researcher/instructor since 1990 (e.g. at Utrecht University)\n\nJava programmer/instructor since 1998 (e.g st Sun Microsystems)\n\nScala programmer since 2010\n\nSpeaker at Scala Days 2011 and 2012\n\nModular program syntax and semantics in Scala\n\nThis talk is about modular program syntax and semantics in Scala.\nThe approach is similar to the one in the \"\"Functional Programming in Scala\"\" book (Part 4), but, in a way, it takes a different approach by also explicitely considering the applicative functor operations as language composition primitives."
