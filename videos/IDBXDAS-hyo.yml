Over the past few years, Varasanos website, www.varasanos.com, has attracted international attention and a cult following as the most accurate and extensive source of information about gourmet pizza on the web. There are currently over 2000 links to Varasano's recipe - not bad for a guy who started out making English muffin pizzas in his toaster oven!"
