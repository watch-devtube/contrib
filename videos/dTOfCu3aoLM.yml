description: "CF Server-Less: CloudFoundry as a Platform for Server-less Computing - Nima Kaviani & Michael Maximilien, IBM\n\nAs CloudFoundry matures to become the de-facto platform for enterprise cloud computing, it is no surprise that various types of computing services need to be supported. Server-less computing is a new name for various previous concepts or technologies, e.g. functors, functional programming. In this model of computing, applications are written as a series of small functions with clear input and output and can be executed in the cloud on demand. The difference between this approach and eg. micro-services is that the backend part only executes when invoked. In this talk we compare and contrast possible approaches to make CF a first class platform for server-less computing. We explore retrofitting the current CF app push model, leverage open source server less platforms like OpenWhisk, and investigate how the CF runtime (Diego) could be improved to support server less apps as on-off tasks.\n\nAbout Nima Kaviani\nNima Kaviani is a Cloud Engineer with IBM Cloud Labs and also a member of Cloud Foundry's Diego Team. Nima has a PhD in computer science, and has been working in the area of multi-cloud and hybrid cloud as part of his PhD work. He has also been the developer of Cloud Foundry BlueDocs, and has been actively writing about the experience of developing Cloud Foundry.\n\nAbout Michael (aka dr.max) Maximilien\nMy name is Michael Maximilien, better known as max or dr.max, and I am a computer scientist with IBM. At IBM Research Triangle Park, I was a principal engineer for the worldwide industry point-of-sale standard: JavaPOS. At IBM Research, some highlights include pioneering research on semantic Web services, mashups, and cloud computing, and platform-as-a-service. I joined the IBM Cloud Labs in 2014 and work closely with Pivotal Inc., to help make the Cloud Found the best PaaS."
