description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Marius Bogoevici\nData / Integration Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/building-modular-business-applications\nBy its very nature, Spring Integration allows for building sophisticated business systems that aggregate multiple sources of data and orchestrate a complex set of business services. But complex functionality doesn’t have to translate into complex design. In fact, through its emphasis on low coupling, Spring Integration is fostering a highly modular application design, with huge benefits in terms of understandability, reusability and testability.\n\nIn this session you will learn how to design your Spring Integration applications in a modular fashion, by grouping together logically-related components into subsystems that interact with each other, a core concept of Spring XD, but can be successfully applied in any application. Besides the benefit of a heightened level of abstraction, this approach has a number of other important benefits as well: first, such subsystems are reusable, and, secondly, and equally important, they can be tested in isolation.\n\nSo, after a brief discussion on reusability, the presentation will focus on how to unit test such subsystems and even complete Spring Integration applications, with the ultimate goal of applying business-centric techniques such as Behaviour-Driven Development."
