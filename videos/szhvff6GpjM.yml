title: '"Gamma: A simple model for WebGL" by Kovas Boguta'
language: English
recordingDate: 1443380781
description: "WebGL and its cousins are festooned with incidental complexity, resulting in low developer productivity, and brittle monolithic codebases. Typical GL frameworks introduce a set of mutually incompatible abstractions, without fixing the core problem. Gamma provides a simple data-driven model for WebGL, much as React provides a model for the DOM. This model makes it easy to compose and abstract WebGL using vanilla Clojure/script, allowing for simpler, more powerful, and more reusable graphics software. Gamma also inherits Clojure's platform and library story, enabling a la carte graphics libraries and graphics application portability across web, mobile, and desktop.\n\nKovas Boguta\nKOVAS BOGUTA\n@kovasb\n\nKovas Boguta is an independent engineer and researcher associated with Kitchen Table Coders in Brooklyn. Previous to Gamma, Kovas has worked on Session (a next-generation notebook for Clojure), as a data scientist at Weebly, founder of Infoharmoni (YC-backed Twitter visualization startup), and as a research assistant to Stephen Wolfram on projects relating to A New Kind of Science, Mathematica, and Wolfram Alpha. Kovas enjoys cellular automata, global-scale visualization, and extremely large books; he just finished Francis Fukuyama's Political Order and Political Decay."
