description: 'Codemotion Milan 2015 - PHP has come a long way in the past 20 years. The current state of PHP is based on a long progression of both technical and non-technical decisions along with a few accidents. In the end what we have is a tool that has enabled hundreds of thousands of people to turn their ideas into reality and at least some of these ideas are reshaping our towns, countries and perhaps even the entire world.'
