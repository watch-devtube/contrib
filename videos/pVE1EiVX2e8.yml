description: "Doug Hood\nConsulting Member of Technical Staff\nOracle\n\nOracle databases store business critical data. Rather than getting inputs for machine learning from log files, why not use the relational data that runs your company? This talk is focused on the useful aspects of machine learning and data science that developers and DBAs can apply without requiring a PhD in AI or advanced statistics. The talk gives examples of using SQL analytics, ROracle and Python for machine learning based on data in Oracle database tables."
