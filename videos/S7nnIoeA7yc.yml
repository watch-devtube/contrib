description: "by Joris Geessels\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.120/python_extending_numba.webm\n\n\nOver the years the Numba project has proven itself to be a pragmatic and effective tool to accelerate numerical computations significantly. Numba however puts some restrictions on the code that can be accelerated. These restrictions can force you to compromise, making your code less readable or more difficult to integrate with the rest of your code. This tradeoff makes Numba less attractive. In this talk I'll share what I've learned integrating Numba in our simulator. We'll look at the architecture of Numba and explore how we can extend it to ensure our code can be accelerated without having to trade in expressiveness. \n\nRoom: UD2.120 (Chavanne)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 14:00:00+01"
