description: "Charles Chen, David Tseng, Volker Sorge \n\nComprehending and navigating complex web pages is difficult already for readers with perfect eyesight, but much harder when relying on speech rendering only. The ChromeVox screen reader is specifically built to handle modern web content in all its richness. ChromeVox is Javascript-based and makes it easy for developers to make cutting-edge web applications accessible.\n\nWe demonstrate the latest incarnation of ChromeVox that offers advanced navigation facilities for complex content such as tables and mathematical formulas as well as support for Braille and new HTML5 UI controls such as date/time, and media controls.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
