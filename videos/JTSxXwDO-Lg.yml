description: 'Microservice architecture is rapidly changing the way we develop our applications. Small, highly decoupled software component are the foundation of this architecture. But hey that’s the theory. Now how can we apply it in our day to day job? How can we structure our application to unleash the benefit of a microservice architecture? Come to my talk and we’ll see an introduction to a real microservice implementation using Seneca.js toolkit. By leveraging plugins, commands and other features available in Seneca.js we’ll see how we can build a microservice application.'
