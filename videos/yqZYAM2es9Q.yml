description: "Speech, mixed reality and machine learning are all the rage. How do we incorporate these emerging technologies into today’s web and provide enriching opportunities for creators and compelling experiences for users? How do we make those experiences buildable and deployable at scale to everyone, everywhere? Come hear how Mozilla blends established core web components like JavaScript with breakthrough new capabilities like WebAssembly and powerful new programming languages like Rust to transform the web.\n\nDavid is a Fellow in Mozilla’s Emerging Technologies group, providing technical expertise for Mozilla's engineering and leads its Developer Outreach team. Before this he led product engineering, marketing, sales enablement and technology licensing at Bell Labs, Sun and Nokia.
