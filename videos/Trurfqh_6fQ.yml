description: "In this keynote presentation at JAXConf 2012, Douglas \"The JavaScript Guy\" Crockford asserts that JavaScript has become the most important programming language in the world.\n\n\"The first time I saw JavaScript in 1995 I thought this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I said that. And I was pretty confident that I was right. ... In looking deeply at it I discovered it's got lambdas in it! Suddenly all this potential opened up.\"\n\n** For many more talks from JAX Conf 2012, head to http://mrkn.co/txtch where we will be posting them as they become available."
