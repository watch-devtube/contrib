description: "Speaker: Michael Plod, InnoQ\nThis is the first of a five-part webinar series about Domain-Driven Design. Part One provides you with a brief overview of Domain-Driven Design. You will learn that Domain-Driven Design is not just limited to a technical way of modeling and structuring your software.\n\nDomain-Driven Design is so much more because it also delivers a set of core values for your project work. Some of those values are around the way we integrate technical people and domain experts in projects, others are about agility and refactoring and one of the most important constructs of Domain-Driven Design is the so called Ubiquitous Language. The latter aims at establishing a common language which is mandatory in a team context or project.\n\nIn part one of this webinar series, you will learn how to identify and establish an Ubiquitous Language. We will also look into ways of documenting this language.\n\nThe webinar series will consist of five parts:\n\nPart One - Overview and Core Values of Domain-Driven Design\nPart Two - Strategic Design: Domains, Subdomains, Bounded Contexts and Context Maps\nPart Three - Tactical Design: Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, and more\nPart Four - Domain Events, Event Storming and Event Sourcing\nPart Five - Implementing \"Domain-Driven Microservices\" with Spring Boot, Data and Cloud"
