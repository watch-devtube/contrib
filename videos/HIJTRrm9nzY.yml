description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nCUDA is a parallel computing platform for a generic computing on Nvidia GPUs. We will focus on CUDA C/C++ programming, covering in detail various types of GPU memory (Shared/Global/Texture/ConstShared/Pinned), optimization of the work distribution between CUDA “threads”, precompiled CUDA code VS Runtime Compilation. \nOften the CUDA code is written in C style, missing the opportunity to use safer and more readable C++ constructs. In the spirit of the conference a special focus will be given to the use of modern C++ features in the CUDA applications inside the device (“kernel”) code, host code, and more importantly – which of the C++ paradigms can cross the bridge between the two worlds. \n— \nMichael Gopshtein, Eyeway Vision\nFramework TL\n\nMichael is a software engineer with more that 15 years of C++ experience. He worked on various performance-bound projects, like load generation on servers, network sniffing and packet analysis. In the recent years Michael is focused on Augmented Reality challenges in Eyeway Vision, where he got interested in accelerating Computer Vision algorithms on GPU, in particular in profiling and optimizing CUDA code. Michael is a big C++ enthusiast, a co-organizer of a local “Core C++” user group and occasional blogger.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
