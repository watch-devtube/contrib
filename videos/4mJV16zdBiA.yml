recordingDate: 1540169723
description: "Almost all companies need to get better, faster, cheaper and happier! But how? Business Agility is an option but changing culture is not easy and having teams learn and do all the Agile practices is not enough. \nConway’s law, which states that at the root of all complex systems and processes lie complex structure, is so true and this talk is all about what needs to change in traditional organisational structures in order to drive business agility and deliver great outcomes.\nThe talk is based on hands-on experience over the last 12 years in structurally transforming organisations to an Agile way of working and will cover how to deal with issues of scale, org design and resistance to change. \nThis presentation will walk through the why what and how of the entire approach, sharing the good and gory experiences, the successes and the pitfalls.\n\nWith 31 years of business and IT experience and over 18 years of consulting and management experience with blue chip companies in Australia, Europe and the USA, Phil is a proven entrepreneur, executive leadership coach and management consultant.\n\nPhil is considered one of the leading experts in Agile and Lean in Australia and NZ and has been instrumental in setting up the Agile Academy. He is the founder of Purple Candor and his 12 years of Agile experience firmly establishes him as an executive coach and trainer in the Agile/Lean arena, specialising in helping organizations transform to a more productive way of working.\n\n His 14 year IT career with Shell, culminating as CIO, combined with the experience thereafter of building and running his own Professional Services company for 18 years gives Phil the unique combination of in-depth IT knowledge, business acumen (financial services, energy, telecom and new media sectors) and dynamic leadership.\n\nFor more on YOW!
