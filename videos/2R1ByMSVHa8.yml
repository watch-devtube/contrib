description: "Video recording of a presentation given at JDK IO conference in Copenhagen in June 2018 at the IT-University organized by the Danish Java User Group - Javagruppen.\n\nhttps://jdk.io/jdk-io-2018/speakers/221-gilles-di-guglielmo\nhttps://jdk.io/jdk-io-2018/speakers/264-alexandre-dubreuil\n\nDSL.using(java).toGoBeyond(BeanValidation).at(JDK.IO);\n\nSpeakers: Gilles Di Guglielmo & Alexandre DuBreuil\n\nFluent, stream-like API are great for writing type checked code, taking advantage of Java 8 functions and lambdas.\n\nBut what about creating your own fluent API to manipulate and validate your model?\n\nWe created an open-source framework called dOOv, for \"Domain Object Oriented Validation\" (http://doov.io), that generates a validation DSL from a domain model.\n\nThis presentation will demonstrate the efficiency and expressiveness of dOOv to define validation constraints.\n\nThe validation rules are represented as an abstract syntax tree, which makes it possible to visit the tree and show the rule in text format, markdown, or HTML.\n\nWe will compare our solution to industry standards like Bean Validation. During the session, we will live code legacy business rule migration to dOOv."
