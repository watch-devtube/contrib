recordingDate: 1497619871
description: "Filmed in Barcelona at ElixirConf EU 2017\n\nProtocols are an important part of the Elixir language, and they play a key role in many of its prominent libraries. However, it's not always obvious how and when to use them. In this talk, we'll demystify protocols and see how to leverage them to solve real-world problems. We'll walk through some practical examples to see how protocols can solve a variety of use cases. We'll start with some simple examples and end with relatively sophisticated scenarios. We'll even dive into the Elixir source code to see how protocols are implemented on the BEAM. After attending this talk, you'll have practical understanding of protocols and the use cases they can help solve.\n\nElixirConf EU is a community conference created to promote education, networking and collaboration within the Elixir/Erlang/Ruby communities."
