title: 'CON7547   Beyond the Coffee Cup: Leveraging Java Runtime Technologies for Polyglot'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449839114
description: "Java virtual machines (JVMs) are now being used to implement runtimes for many different kinds of languages. Building on top of JVMs leverages the mature runtime technology resulting from decades of investment and enables great interoperability with Java applications. But adoption of languages that aren’t really like Java has been relatively low, because the JVM interface is really designed to run only Java well. This session discusses experiments in unlocking the underlying internal mechanisms of a production JVM to provide key technologies for polyglot runtimes. This work in progress has shown some important successes and holds excellent promise for interoperability between Java and other language services with unprecedented performance.\n\nSpeaker:\nDaryl Maier, Compiler Development and Performance, IBM Canada"
