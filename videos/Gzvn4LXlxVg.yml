recordingDate: 1566925203
description: "In our previous episodes of the AI Show, we've introduced to you Azure Anomaly Detector in both hosted cloud APIs and containers (Introducing Azure Anomaly Detector (https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show/Introducing-Azure-Anomaly-Detector) and Bring Anomaly Detector on-premise with containers support (https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show/Bring-Anomaly-Detector-on-premise-with-containers-support)). In this episode, we're moving one step closer to your production usage of the service. We're sharing with you three tips or best practices that you will want to know before you design your monitoring application architecture.\n\nTip 1: Batch with \"/entire\" and streaming with \"/last\".\nTip 2: Streaming in practice: you need to have a data pre-processor to load, cache, and prepare the data and make HTTP calls to get the anomalies from \"/last\" endpoint.\nTip 3: Data preparation: the v1.0 API only accepts time series data formated in JSON; The data points need to distribute evenly on timeline; to gain best performance when there're seasonal patterns, use \"period\" and send 4 X period +1 data points in each HTTP call.\n\nRe-Visit Your Favorite Part of the Video: \n[00:46] Tip 1: Batch mode versus streaming mode in Anomaly Detector.\n[02:76] Tip 2: How to detect anomalies from streaming time series data with Anomaly Detector?\n[05:00] An interactive demo of streaming anomaly detection.\n[06:36] Python code of streaming anomaly detection with Anomaly Detector APIs.\n[07:39] Tip 3: How to preprocess data for Anomaly Detector APIs?\n[08:00] What if the input time series is not evenly distributed?\n[09:04] How to improve the accuracy if the data has seasonal patterns?\n\nCheck out the cool demo on this episode from https://aka.ms/adDemo.\nFind the detailed documentation on the best practices on https://aka.ms/adBest.\nCheck out the overview of the API service on https://aka.ms/AnomalyDetector.\nCreate your first Anomaly Detector resource on Azure: https://aka.ms/adNew.\nJoin Anomaly Detector Containers preview through https://aka.ms/adContainer.\nJoin \"Anomaly Detector Advisors\" public community to connect with the product team and other members in the community through https://aka.ms/adAdvisorsJoin.\n\nThe AI Show’s Favorite Links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show: https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show?ocid=AID2463683&wt.mc_id=ai-c9-sejuare\nCreate a Free account (Azure): https://aka.ms/aishowazurefree \nFollow Seth on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sethjuarez\nAI Blog: https://openai.com/blog/\nFast ML: http://fastml.com/\nMIT News | AI: https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\nMedium | Francesca Lazzeri: https://medium.com/@francescalazzeri\nDeep Learning vs. Machine Learning: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-deep-learning-vs-machine-learning?WT.mc_id=docs-article-lazzeri\nFollow Channel 9 On Twitter: https://twitter.com/ch9"
