title: 'Slaying Sacred Cows: Deconstructing Dependency Injection - Tomer Gabel (Hebrew)'
recordingDate: 1514200153
description: "This talk revisits dependency injection, and attempts to answer a single question honestly, or at least while pointing out and acknowledging the biases at play: \"is dependency injection a good thing?\"\n\nDependency injection has fast established itself as a major design pattern in modern software. No longer the province of server-side and enterprise software, it is now a fundamental component of frameworks from Spring to Angular.js.\n\nWith such widespread success, the time is ripe to take a fresh look at dependency injection if we are to understand it better. After all, DI is instrumental in building large systems that are loosely coupled, and it cleanly separates your tests from implementation... or does it?\n\nA programming junkie and computer history aficionado, Tomer's been around the block a few times before settling at Wix as a system architect. In the last few of years he's developed a major crush on Scala, promoting it within the Israeli software industry as part of Java.IL (Israeli Java user group) and Underscore (Israeli Scala user group).\n\nJava.IL - the Israeli Java Community:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/JavaIL\n\nHosted by Wix.com"
