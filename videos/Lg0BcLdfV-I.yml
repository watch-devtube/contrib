description: "Introducing the CERN Open Hardware Licence version 2 Covering some of the major changes in this new version of CERN-OHL\nby Andrew Katz\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.220/cern_ohl_v2.webm\n\n\nThe CERN OHL is a copyleft open hardware licence which was launched in March 2011. It has undergone point releases 1.1 and 1.2 and since then, but feedback from user communities, particularly those working with microprocessor cores and FPGAs has made us reconsider some of the fundamental assumptions made when the licence was first drafted. We have shamelessly taken ideas from other licences as well as introducing some new approaches, driven by the needs of users. This session introduces our new draft of version 2.0, which aims to make v2.0 more flexible than any previous version, while increasing clarity of drafting. Full Description}\nHardware is more complex than software from an intellectual property perspective, and this makes developing an open hardware licence, especially a copyleft/reciprocal open hardware licence, particularly challenging. The CERN OHL has been designed to work with as wide a range of hardware as possible, from artistic works, through mechanical devised, to circuit board layouts and, more particularly to software, microprocessor cores and even FPGAs and ASICs. At the same time, we recognise that hardware is a different domain from software, and that it is a mistake to assume that lessons learned in the software domain can automatically be applied to open hardware. \n\nWe have listened to the concerns of many users and potential users of the CERN OHL, and have produced a radical redraft of the licence which aims to: \n\nbe concise and clear;\nbe appropriate for a wide range of different use cases in fields of use (such as microprocessor cores, FPGAs and ASICs);\nbe appropriate for a wide range of users, from not-for-profits through to commercial organisations;\nbe compatible, so far as possible with other licences like GPLv3 and TAPR;\nbe easy to use;\ndiscourage licence proliferation;\nencourage compliance as the main outcome of enforcement;\nmaximise the availability of open hardware designs to the public;\nmaintain the same spirit as the previous versions of the CERN OHL;\nallow for strong- and weak-reciprocal licensing models, as well as permissive models. \n\nThe new version 2, in its three variants - strong, weak and permissive, is the culmination of significant drafting effort with the input of a wide range of users and potential users of open hardware licensing. \n\nThis talk introduces some of the key concepts in the CERN-OHLv2, explains its evolution from previous versions, and aims to explain how it can best be applied to a number of different types of hardware. \n\nRoom: UA2.220 (Guillissen)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 11:00:00+01"
