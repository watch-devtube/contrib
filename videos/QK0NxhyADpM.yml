description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nTutorial: From Notebook to Kubeflow Pipelines with HP Tuning: A Data Science Journey - Stefano Fioravanzo & Ilias Katsakioris, Arrikto \n\nAn introduction to Kubeflow, the ML toolkit for K8s and the workflows you can use as a data scientist to scale up your ML code effortlessly.  Ever thought how hard it is to convert your Jupyter Notebooks into deployable and composable pipelines, scale up computation and run hyperparameter tuning? With Kubeflow, this process becomes extremely easy as you make use of the many components of this ML toolkit: Pipelines, Kale, Katib, Snapshot Store.  You will learn how to deploy Kubeflow in minutes, explore your ML code inside a Jupyter Notebook, convert it to a composable and scalable workflow with the click of a button, make the pipeline reproducible using immutable snapshots, go back in history and debug it, run hyperparameter tuning and distribute your computation.  Did we mention you won’t need any specific SDK or CLI command to do this? Sounds like magic? Come and see for yourself!\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZerG"
