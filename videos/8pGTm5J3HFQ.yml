description: "DevDay (http://devday.pl)\n26th of September 2014\n\nBen Hall - \"Learning to Think The 'Designer Way'\"\n\n\"The best way to annoy a designer is to tell them that a red block should be blue, that a piece of text should be moved over, or to make the logo bigger without any motivation or reasoning. The best way to give constructive feedback is to have evidence based on the site flow, design goals, visual principles and user behaviour to support the problems that you see with the design.\n\nTo provide this you need to start thinking like a designer. In this session Ben will discuss how to start thinking like a designer, the core principals of design that affect our opinions of applications on a sub-concussion level based on the key design principles and how to start defining potential solutions the designer way. Alongside this Ben will also attempt to provide answers to the “blank canvas” problem and how you can go from nothing to something, an activity that designers seem to do without even thinking. As companies and communities embrace full-stack developers it’s time to start including design within that stack and not just a single person’s responsibility.\""
