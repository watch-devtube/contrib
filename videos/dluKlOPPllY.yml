description: "Filmed at https://2019.dotswift.io on January 28th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nUITableViews and UITableViewCells are great. They are the bread and butter of iOS development. You can see them in pretty much every app out there. Knowing how to set them up is almost like a right of passage into being a real iOS developer. But, they can be pretty cumbersome to deal with using Apple's out of-of-the-box components. Lea goes over a couple of examples on how to use Swift features like enums, protocols, extensions, and generics in practical ways to tackle everyday UITableView frustrations."
