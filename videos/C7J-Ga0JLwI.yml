Dependency issues due to a somewhat deep dependency graph has made it more painful than it ought to be. In this talk we will look at how to deal with such a dependency problem using xref and Columbo, the dependency detective tool. We will also visit how the changes makes using riak_core in your own application a breeze.\n\nAbout Torben\n\nTorben Hoffman has been working with Erlang since 2006. Currently as an architect for Basho, previously as CTO of Erlang Solutions and before that as technical architect and developer for Motorola and Issuu.
