This is a 5 Week Instructor led Online Course.\n2. Course consists of 30 hours of online classes, 20 hours of assignment, 20 hours of project\n3. We have a 24x7 One-on-One LIVE Technical Support to help you with any problems you might face or any clarifications you may require during the course.\n4. You will get Lifetime Access to the recordings in the LMS.\n5. At the end of the training you will have to complete the project based on which we will provide you a Verifiable Certificate!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nAbout the Course\n\nEdureka's Kubernetes Certification Training introduces you with the advantages provided by containers over the virtual machines. \n\nYou will understand why we need an orchestration tool for containers. You will also get to know the boundaries of Kubernetes – what it does and what is it not supposed to do. \n\nYou will also understand the inherent architecture of Kubernetes – master components, node components and the addons provided by it. The course will start off with learning the basic components of Kubernetes like Node, Pod, Deployment, Services, APIs etc and then teach you to create a local cluster using Ubuntu VMs. \n\nYou will also learn to deploy stateful and stateless apps on the cluster. Finally, you will learn, how to expose these app outside of the kubernetes cluster and will also get to know how to scale their apps either manually or using auto scaling. Learn the best security practices that must be followed during this container and cluster orchestration.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nWho should go for this course?\n\nA research states that there are already 10,000 companies who have adopted containers for taking their application to production and there are already 185 million containers on use in the world. The rate of adoption of Docker is increasing by 40% every year. Now that Docker has become the most integral part of production environment, various organizations are now looking out for tools that can help them effectively manage and orchestrate their containers. \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free).”"
