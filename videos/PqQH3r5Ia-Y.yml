recordingDate: 1457035201
description: "Linear interpolation is a powerful tool, made even moreso when combined with smoothing functions like cubics. In this video we show how to derive a cubic polynomial that satisfies our desired properties.\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/numerical-cubic\n\nNew video every Thursday.
