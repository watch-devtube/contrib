We will walk you through the life of a change, what type of tests it has to go through, what type of checks a PR has to go through, what automation is in placed, how different infrastructure pieces are wired together, and how everything contributes to the end result which is a successful release. There will be live demos as well. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Grdv"
