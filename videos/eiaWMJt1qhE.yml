I thought it was a good idea, so here I'll show you over 30 common Java errors.\n\nSometimes it is hard to figure out what Cannot be Resolved, Syntax Error on Token, or Method is not Visible mean. But, after watching this video you should better understand. \n\nAlso, you'll learn how to get Eclipse to help you fix Java errors."
