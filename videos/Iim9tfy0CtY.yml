description: "Google Tech Talk (more information below)\r\nMarch 16, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Ingrid Newkirk, founder PETA.org\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nMs. Newkirk will talk about PETA's philosophy and the value of kindness to all.  She will explain why PETA sometimes produces provocative posters featuring celebrities posing naked, and the worth of generating internet buzz in a media age, discussing the power of video to change hearts and minds and to  get people involved. Her discussion will pinpoint the causes of the tragic overpopulation crisis for dogs and cats in the U.S., what this means for homeless animals and practical ways in which people can help.  She hopes to inform the audience about the wonder of animals, their cultures and behaviors and how easy it is to make kind choices."
