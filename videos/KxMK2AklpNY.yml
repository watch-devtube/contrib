description: "Web development has an undeserved reputation. Many in our industry hesitate to call it \"real programming,\" yet designing even the simplest web application draws upon deep traditions in networked computing.\n\nIn this webdev real talk, we are going back to the beginning. We will graph out the advancement of web systems from their humble origins, and, with each new storage and rendering component, watch the architectures of today's massive web systems emerge. Then, we will explore recent works from members of the greater Clojure community that push the boundaries of this era in our distributed web."
