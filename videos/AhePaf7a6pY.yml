recordingDate: 1433258938
description: "Vert.x is a lightweight, high-performance, polyglot, asynchronous application platform for the JVM. This session covers the design principles and motivation behind Vert.x, including its concurrency model, and discusses why Vert.x is a great fit for super-simple, highly concurrent applications. It also dives into some of the key Vert.x features, including the distributed event bus and high availability, and discusses some of the up-and-coming new features in the latest development branch for Vert.x 3.0, including distributed map support, management, and monitoring. The presentation includes demonstrations involving examples in several JVM languages such as Java, JavaScript, Scala, and Groovy.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTim Fox\nTim Fox is the project lead of Vert.x. Tim started to develop Vert.x at VMware and has since moved back to Red Hat where he continue to work as the lead of the Vert.x project.
