description: "A talk from Barcelona Ruby Conference 2013 (http://baruco.org)\n\nAfter working with Ruby for several years, I joined a project team focused on Clojure, which provided an opportunity to look at programming through a new lens. In this talk I'll share some of the challenges I faced, new lessons I learned, and old lessons that were reinforced.\n\nhttp://www.baruco.org/talks/a-rubyist-in-clojure-land\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)"
