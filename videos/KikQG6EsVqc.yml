description: "Chastity Blackwell, Yelp\n\nDocumentation can often be forgotten when it comes to the pillars of SRE practice; developing tools and new infrastructure has supremacy, and a constant sense of urgency leads to documentation being a \"we'll get around to it later\" task.

This can impair onboarding, obfuscate problems, and impair incident response.

This talk will discuss the biggest problems surrounding creating, maintaining, and providing utility with documentation, and how to solve them.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
