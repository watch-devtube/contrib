description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nSpeaker: Gary P. Russell\nNote: this session is a follow on to Gary's popular June 2012 webinar, located here\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkZcF47NRu0\n\nIn this presentation we will discuss the options for managing and monitoring applications that use Spring Integration. It will provide a comprehensive overview of the extensive support for JMX provided by Spring Integration, both in terms of providing access to Spring Integration internals, as well as creating a JMX client to interact with local and remote MBeanServers.\n\nIn addition, we will show how to use the Spring Integration plugin for Spring Insight to drill down into Spring Integration flow processing to examine application performance.\n\nTopics include:\n\n    Using the Integration MBean Exporter, and the MBeans it registers, for analyzing Messaging Endpoints and Channels.\n    Exporting the Integration MBean Exporter itself as an MBean, to gain access to it's attributes and operations.\n    Using the Control Bus to start and stop endpoints.\n    Using the Spring Integration plugin for Spring Insight to get a real-time view of your application and its performance.\n    Enabling and using Message History\n    Using the orderly shutdown mechanism available in Spring Integration 2.2.\n    Using JMX endpoints (with local and remote MBeanServers) to monitor attributes,  invoke operations, publish notifications, and receive notifications."
