recordingDate: 1530784519
description: "Major advances have been made in developing applications that utilize some form of artificial intelligence, but there’s not nearly as much consideration given to how to test them. Angie Jones gives an overview of why it’s extremely important that these applications be tested and how developers can begin to prepare and build their skillset for this new realm of software. She explores today's cutting edge, innovative applications that utilize machine learning and discusses the challenges of ensuring that they actually work the way we intend them to.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
