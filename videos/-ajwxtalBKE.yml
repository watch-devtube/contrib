description: 'The problem is not fixed price contracts. The problem is fixed scope contracts. Contracts for legal services and marketing services do not have "scope." Contracts for engineering services and even software maintenance services do not have "scope." But for some reason, contracts for software development services are usually accompanied by a long list of features and functions to be delivered -- and this is called "scope." What we need is a short list of problems to be solved, instead of bad amateur design of their solutions. Agile contracts leave solution design to software engineers and control projects through the regular delivery of measurable value. Mary Poppendieck will discuss software development as a design and delivery service, and the contracts which support a professional approach to software engineering.'
