description: "JavaFX 8 offers a rich set of visually appealing GUI components with a property binding mechanism for event handling. This tutorial shows how JavaFX binding makes desktop client application development easier and faster. It begins with an overview of JavaFX binding strategies as an alternative to event listeners. After seeing how bindings work with JavaFX controls, you will learn how JavaFX binding simplifies event-driven programming with effects, shapes, and animation.
