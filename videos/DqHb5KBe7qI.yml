description: "Go’s headline feature is its simple, lightweight concurrency, but most Go programmers that stick with the language for a while tend to look back on their early efforts and say things like “wow, I really went overboard with channels” or “I went crazy with goroutines, it was impossible to understand what the program did”. Clearly there is a disconnect between the concurrency primitives that the language offers, and the expectations of many why come to Go for exactly those features. This talk will explore some strategies for using with concurrency in Go without the pitfalls.\n\nEVENT:\n\nGopherCon SG 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nDave Cheney\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKQOunhhf4A"
