Google has set a high bar for user expectations: so how can you make your application deliver?\n\nA major advantage of Lucene-based search solutions is the ability to tailor the search behavior to meet your specific application needs... how can you do the same with query suggestions?\n\nThis talk will introduce Lucene's suggester implementations and how to use their features efficiently. We will walk through pitfalls, real world experiences and running applications serving large amounts of suggestions. This is a \"must attend\" if you wanna work with suggestions.\nAbout the speaker: \nRobert Muir is a Lucene/Solr PMC Member and Committer.
