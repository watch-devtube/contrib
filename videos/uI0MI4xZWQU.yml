description: "The future. Vast topic. Fun fact: you know a little bit more about future since you started reading this sentence. Crazy, right? Everybody wants to know what will happen in the near future. Especially in our fantastic industry where being first often means being kings and where robots are sneaking their way to the top of the food chain. Everybody wants to control the future. Everybody? Maybe not.\n\nA group of strange people is silently fighting really hard against the future in all its various forms. They fight hard against progress. They build stupid AIs to stop the creation of killing machines. They plan project production using 5 years planning in spreadsheets made with Excel 98 to fight against those who try to live longer. They exploit every bit of data of our large disks using SVN to be sure that no vicious malware has room there. They fight against the ones who want to deliver better software more often building only once in a 5 years period.\n\nThese saviors of tomorrow are game developers.\n\nGather round me and hear the story of these anonymous heroes who, every day, try to save the world using outdated technologies and methods. Welcome to the video game industry.\n\n# Laurent Victorino\nNatural born curious, gamer, and dreamer, I always loved to smash my keyboard randomly waiting for cool things to happen. Even if I made a lot of different stuff back then, I decided very early that my professional life would be full of video games. I worked several years on AAA console games for big publishers and now I'm making my way as an independent with my own company Monkey Moon.\n\nAs I try to be a bit more than a code monkey I love talking about video game development in places people don't expect."
