description: "Laurent Rosenfeld (?lolo78?). Functional Programming in Perl 6\nThe Perl Conference in Amsterdam\n9 August 2017\n\nPerl 5 offers numerous ways of using the functional programming paradigm, as superbly shown by Mark Jason Dominus in his \"Higher Order Perl\" book. Perl 6 goes much further in this direction. I intend to show several examples where using the functional programming concepts can make your code shorter, clearer and more expressive. You can even make your Perl 6 code almost entirely functional, Lisp-, Haskell- or Scala-like, as some examples will show. \n\nhttp://act.perlconference.org/tpc-2017-amsterdam/talk/7069"
