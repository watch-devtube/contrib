description: "Content warning: High frequency visual flickering and noise.\n\nThese days people chase the dream of high performance, fast loading slick web sites. But in the 1980s computers were ugly, slow and loud: let’s make that instead 👴👵💪\n\nThe first generation of home computers launched a movement of developers and hackers across the world. But to start your app, you had to load a tape (a really old usb-type-thing), press play, and patiently wait for the screech of the program to load (akin to listening to a fax machine).\n\nWhy invest time in building fast website, when we can have fun building slow old retro machines using JavaScript. The end result is a mix of Web Audio, canvas API, cameras, audio jacks, binary, typed arrays, blobs, history of computing and a lot of questionable JavaScript.\n\nOMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
