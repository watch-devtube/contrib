title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: What Do You Want To Do When You Grow Up?'
recordingDate: 1523562654
description: "\"What do you want to do when you grow up?\" is a question we use as an ice breaker for interviews, one-on-ones, and learning / growth plan discussions. It always brings a chuckle and a genuine response from everyone - regardless of age, role, or job position.\n\nBut figuring out what you want to do can be hard. Reaching and obtaining your goals can be even harder.\_Not only for yourself, but for managers and leads, for your team members, too. Turning knowledge into action (the\_\"Knowing-Doing Gap\") is also a hurdle in reaching your goals.\_One\_may know how they want to grow, but may need some help in how to go about it.\n\nThis session will cover methods to create and execute\_individual\_improvement plans, hopefully without sounding too menacing.\n\nSeriously - the words \"improvement plan\" sounds like someone is in trouble! And execute. Dang. This is sounding management-y. In that scary way. That\_is what many employees feel going into a formal growth plan and review process. \"Formal.\" Another trigger word. Now that person may be scared, unsure, in trouble(?), vulnerable, exposed, overwhelmed. Yikes!\_\n\nThis session will cover how to get past the fears and baggage to create\_mutual personal and business growth for your team members.\n\nThe topics covered:\n\nQuantify the worth of personal growth to the business\nAlign\_personal growth to the company business goals\nTechniques for team mentorship:\nCoaching and supporting the goal setting process\nIdentifying actional, obtainable goals\nStrategic execution plan to achieve\_goals\nMeasuring / tracking progress\nCommon challenges with mentorship\nWorking through challenges in a positive, supportive method\nTools / templates used to capture and track goals (although this is not the focus)\nSpeakers: Aimee Degnan (CEO of Hook 42) and Genevieve Parker (Operations Manager / Head of HR of Hook 42).\n\nLevel of knowledge required\_\n\nAny!\_\n\nTarget audiences and their takeaways\n\nAll:\nCool. I can see how to level up and help achieve my personal goals!\nWow!\_I now have a way to articulate where am I now and where do I want to go.\nI hope my manager / lead / coach / partner will mentor me in this way.\nOh, could I apply this to growth within the Drupal community?!\nEmployees / Independents :\nIdentify if your environment is providing the mentorship you need.\nUse the tools to create some self-planning, should you not have the job support for growth.\_\nHave terms and concepts\_to articulate your needs to peers and management.\nManagement / owner / boss-peoples types:\nPrerequisites to mentorship relationships.\nMethods\_to achieve\_effective results.\nYou don't need a lot of overhead to create an effective growth plan."
