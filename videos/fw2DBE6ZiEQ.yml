description: "31.03.15\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/stephanewen1/flink-history-roadmap-and-vision\n\nApache Flink Committer Stephan Ewen gives a talk about Apache Flink's History and Vision during the Apache Flink Meetup in Berlin. \n\nIn April 2014, Flink (back then called Stratosphere) was proposed as an incubating project to the Apache Software Foundation. Nine months later, Flink graduated to an Apache top-level project. To commemorate one year of Flink:\n\n(1) We first take a trip down memory lane and discuss what the Flink community has built during the last year in the Apache Software Foundation. \n\n(2) We then discuss the roadmap for the Flink project for 2015 and current work in progress features, such as the runtime refactoring to include intermediate results and streaming fault tolerance. \n\n(3) Finally, we discuss the greater vision and goals of the Flink project and how the current roadmap leads to realizing this vision.\n\nhttps://flink.apache.org/\nhttp://data-artisans.com/"
