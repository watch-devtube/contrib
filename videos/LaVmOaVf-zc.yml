description: "Jenkins has been the preferred tool for continuous integration and deployment for many years already due to it's smooth user experience, easy configuration, abundance of available plugins and integrations. During the talk we will tell about best practices on using Jenkins together with Cloud Foundry installations, accelerating cloud-native application delivery and packaging using combination of Docker and Jenkins and thoughtful configuration of CI/CD pipelines and keeping apps up-to-date on all CF environments. Together with that, Altoros will make an intro to Jenkins tile for PCF and tell how to boost release engineering practice with the help of this instrument.\n\nSlides: TBA\n \nAndrei Krasnitski, Cloud Foundry Engineer, Altoros\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
