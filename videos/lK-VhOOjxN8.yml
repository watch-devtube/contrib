description: "Slides and more info: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2016/rachel-reese\n\nThis session will cover the many features of functional programming languages that make this way of thinking ideal for reactive service programming. Using F#, we'll briefly cover how immutable events are especially suited to modern applications, and then move on to examples of asynchronous workflows,  MailboxProcessors, and delve into an actor library or two to demonstrate scalable and resilient code."
