title: 'GeeCON Prague 2018: D.Lebrero-REPL Driven Development: immediate feedback for your server side code'
recordingDate: 1541257469
description: 'Drinking too much coffee while maven builds and deploys your service? Jealous of how your FrontEnd mate just press F5 to ''deploy'' his/her changes? Mastered the red-green-refactor workflow and want to know what is the next step? Our Lisp grandfathers knew how invaluable was the immediate feedback that a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) allowed during development and now Java 9 will have one. Perhaps you have read that a REPL is useful for ''playing around'' or for ''small code snippets'', but this is far from true. In this presentation, you will learn how with a REPL you can have a better and more productive developer workflow by building a Tomcat service, one bit at a time, without having to build, compile, package or deploy it. Demo will be done with a Clojure REPL but no previous experience with Clojure is needed.'
