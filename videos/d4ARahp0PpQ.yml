description: "We tend to think of user interfaces and UX as designer concerns that do not apply to us. However, every time we write code to be used by others — or ourselves in the future! — we are creating a UI. A UI whose usability can be vastly improved by many UX principles, some tailored to code, others applying to every UI, ever.\n\nIn this light-hearted talk you will learn a ton of tips and tricks to improve your API design, distilled from Lea’s experience of creating & managing dozens of successful open source projects with thousands of merged pull requests.\n\nEVENT:\n\nYou Gotta Love Frontend 2016\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nLea Verou\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nYou Gotta Love Frontend Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nYou Gotta Love Frontend channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU-fOxx_kT5OARG0KiksiCA"
