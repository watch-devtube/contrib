language: English
recordingDate: 1512052100
description: 'Let’s face it: the term REST is treated as a buzzword these days rather than as an accurate description of the Web’s blueprints. Everybody claim to do REST APIs; the truth is - nobody is doing REST API. It’s time to stop this. In my presentation I’d like to go with you through the original specifications and build an API that will respect all the constraints. All live, no prepared things. Then, we will compare the results with other API that claim to be REST. You will be surprised how different the results will be!'
