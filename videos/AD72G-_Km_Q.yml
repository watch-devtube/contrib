description: "Microsoft is moving to an Open Source and cross platform world, and they’ve created .NET Standard as a super-highway to get you there. With the .NET Standard 2.0 release, the specification includes most of the API’s you depend on in the .NET full framework (.NET 4.n). Because .NET Standard, .NET Core, Xamarin and UWP are all embracing this standard, your class libraries can be easily be cross platform. In this talk, you’ll learn more about the goals of .NET Standard and how it differs from PCLs (Portable Class Libraries). You’ll also see how to use the .NET Portability Analyzer to find any changes your app needs. To show that .NET Standard is not actual magic, you’ll learn a little about how redirects support binary compatibility. And, you’ll learn what happens when an API just doesn’t make sense on a particular platform and other potential pitfalls. You’ll leave this talk understanding why you care about .NET Standard and the path to move your applications to it.\n\nKey takeaways\nWhat is .NET Standard and how does it relates to .NET Core\nDiscover the easy way to write once and run on many platforms\nLearn guidelines for which versions of .NET Standard are your ideal targets\nFuture proof your apps by writing to the .NET Standard specification\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
