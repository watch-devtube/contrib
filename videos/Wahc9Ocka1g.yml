title: '"Strange Loops: Capturing Knots With Powerful Notations" by Katherine Ye'

recordingDate: 1443354211
description: "Mathematician John Conway once boasted that one of his predecessors took six years to enumerate all 54 knots of a certain type, but that his own powerful notation \"made this just one afternoon's work.\"\n\nHow did Conway accomplish this feat? and what tradeoffs did he have to make? and what good is knot theory, anyway?\n\nIn this talk, I will enumerate all the knots of less than or equal 7 crossings by using notations of two different schools of knot theory: Conway's, and that of his predecessor Clifford Dowker. Along the way, we will examine the quality of the notations, and ask how serializing a knot into text allows us to think about it more systematically.\n\nKatherine Ye\nSTUDENT AT PRINCETON\n@hypotext\n\nKatherine likes to study weird interdisciplinary things and powerful notations."
