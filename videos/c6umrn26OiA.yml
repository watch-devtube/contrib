description: 'During this fun and entertaining session, you will learn about the building blocks needed for visualizing your real-time IoT data in the Cloud. Just for the fun of it, we’ll use a flying drone to get some real-time data! We’ll put up a full stack IoT foundation and demonstrate two-way communications with MQTT messaging, without forgetting social media. And everything is visualized with a beautiful monitoring web app. How does this all come together? Come and see, it will be fun and you’ll learn quite a few things along the way. Technologies used: Vaadin Framework for UI, IBM Bluemix for Cloud, Eclipse Paho for MQTT messaging.'
