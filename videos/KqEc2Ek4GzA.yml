description: "PUSH THE BUTTON! ? Designing a fun game where the only input is a BIG RED BUTTON! ? !!! by Mahtab Sabet\n\nIn October 2016, I attended “Gift the Code”, a charity hackathon in Toronto. Our team built “PiKit”, a game designed for kids who lack fine motor control or who have limited mobility. The challenge was to build a fun, compelling, and educational game in which the only input was… a BIG RED BUTTON! ? !!!\n\nThis talk is a beginner’s guide to designing and building a game, based on what I learned as a first-time game developer at the hackathon. I’ll talk about using constraints to spur creativity in a design sprint, how to get inspiration from your favourite games, and how to design a game with logical level progressions so you can help the player understand what to do next, without explicitly telling them what to do.\n\nMahtab works as a Senior Software Engineer at Capital One in Toronto, Canada…striving to perfect an online banking platform that consists entirely of a BIG RED BUTTON! ? !!! (just kidding ??)"
