description: "Playing with Arduino and Johnny-five makes creating something from practically nothing amazingly easy. Come tinker with robots for a bit, we'll make things roll, we'll make things light up, we'll make things input and output. All with just a few lines of Javascript and a bunch of super cheap parts.\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
