description: "http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu2012/public/schedule/detail/26708\n\n\"What it Takes to Keep the World Running\" - Managing Mobile Application Performance at Runtastic\n\nCombining sports and technology (Internet, GPS smartphones), runtastic is making sports even more fun. With over 12 million downloads, runtastic's success with its iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry applications created many operational and performance challenges. We will share three of our biggest headaches and how adopting a new approach to managing application performance kept us going -- and helped us go even further:\n\n• Why crash reports couldn't help us make our users happy? • How Facebook brought down our applications? • What millions of blind spots in our applications meant to our operations?\n\nThis session is sponsored by Compuware\n\nChristian is CTO of Mobile and Co-Founder of runtastic, a leading platform for sport and fitness users around the globe. Christian received his Master's degree in Mobile Computing at the University of Applied Sciences in Hagenberg (Austria). Shortly after completing his Masters, he founded runtastic with three of his classmates in October 2009. In addition, he taught C++ and Windows Phone development at the University of Applied Sciences in Hagenberg. At runtastic Christian is responsible for the development of the runtastic Apps which have been downloaded more than 12 million times."
