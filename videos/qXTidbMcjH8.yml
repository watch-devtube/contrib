description: "In this session, we will explore \"Cloud First\" application development. Typical application development in the cloud often involves a host of tools that either compound or only temporarily alleviate incidental complexity. We'll see how functional programming techniques and tools like Datomic Cloud simplify the development process and allow us to program directly and iteratively in the cloud.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
