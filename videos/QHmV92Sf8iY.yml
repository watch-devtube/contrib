description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nThis talk presents the issue of extracting insights from data sets containing sensitive information, while preserving privacy. We will review the techniques used today for private data sharing and their limitations. We will explain why it is hard to share useful data while preserving the privacy and point to promising approaches enabling the implementation of such a goal.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/figago/privacypreserving-data-sharing-pydata-berlin-2018\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
