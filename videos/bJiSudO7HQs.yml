description: "Teaching an Old Dog New Tricks \nby Karl Jermy (@jermykl)\n\nIf you want to change some things in your life, ...you have to change some things in your life.  What do you do when the rug gets pulled from under your feet?  You think you're on the home stretch and life is a bowl of cherries,  then it turns into the shape of a pear.  One mans story about adapting to change and actually discovering that agile has been around for longer than we think, it's just been called something else.  A glimmer of hope for those of more senior years..........\n\nKarl washed up at Neontribe in 2013 after a period of rest from a fifteen year spell at one of the world's brokest Banks.  Refreshed and liberated, he has embraced the Neontribe work ethic and has been tasked with bringing a level of structure and project management into the team whilst maintaining the fun in delivering brilliant projects.  \n\nOf late he's spent most of his time on virtual holiday in places as far flung and exotic as the Isle of Wight and the Yorkshire Dales.  His interests include hurting himself, lighting fires, Roast duck and rioja, champagne tasting at sunrise, Ian Fraser Kilmister, hand made Italian leather boots, the Canaries and blue skies."
