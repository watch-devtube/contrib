language: English
recordingDate: 1527705204
description: "Robin Moffatt\nPartner Technology Evangelist, EMEA\nConfluent\n\nBuilding a flexible, scalable, real-time data architecture for the enterprise is no simple matter. Rarely does one single technology suit for all requirements, and frequently many different teams are involved which drives solutions with varying levels of [dis-]integration. Apache Kafka is the enabling platform that supports the real-time, high performance, scalable integration of data throughout the enterprise, whilst also providing the messaging capabilities to drive applications directly. This talk will discuss the role and benefits of Kafka in a data architecture, the Kafka ecosystem, and several design patterns used to address specific challenges that organisations face with managing their flows and availability of data."
