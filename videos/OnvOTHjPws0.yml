description: 'Turns out Domain-Driven Design works not only for cargo shipping. I’d like to share the story of Plexop. Plexop is a large-scale marketing system that spans dozens of different business domains, from management of ad spaces to sellers’ commissions. To implement Plexop we had little resources and a very short time to market. That’s why we embraced DDD from day one, and boy did it pay out. I''ll show how DDD allowed us to tackle complexities, talk on strategies for defining service boundaries that we tried, and of course, the things that we had to learn the hard way - by making our own mistakes.'
