description: 'The DevOps movement is gaining momentum - which is good. But still DevOps often is seen way to small. DevOps is not only some more collaboration between Development and Operations. It is the implementation driver for a massive change in IT - and it is not enough in itself. In this session we will examine the drivers and goals behind DevOps, why we need the change, how DevOps affects the whole IT and what else is needed to really "become DevOps". We will develop an "DevOps ecosystem" and draw the missing lines between several important concepts that all feed into the actual goals behind DevOps.'
