description: "by Mei-Chin Tsai and Sergiy Kuryata\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.3.201/dotnet_runtime_tuning.webm\n\n\nDevelopers generally enjoy increased productivity when working in a managed code environment. What might not be obvious to them is the amount of investment in the managed code’s Virtual Machine to enable both productivity and high performance. Microsoft’s .NET team would like to share how they designed the runtime environment to balance convenience, fast startup, serviceability, low latency, high throughput. For examples services such as JIT compilation, TypeSystem, garbage collection all provide convenience but come at a cost. The challenges presented are common to many environments – you do not need to be a .NET developer to attend this talk. \n\nIf you are a .NET developer, you can leverage the tools demo in this talk to tune your application as well. \n\nRoom: K.3.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 17:00:00+01"
