description: "Two Sigma Investments published a $100,000 code competition on Kaggle that asks data scientists around the world to try their best to create an algorithm that can make predictions about anonymous financial instruments (like derivatives, assets, bonds). Normally, reinforcement learning is not used on Kaggle but in this live stream I'll use reinforcement learning to help solve this challenge. This will serve as a great real-world use case for RL and I'll also discuss some other common time series forecasting methods. Get hype!\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Kaggle_Challenge_LIVE-Two-Sigma\n\nDataset:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-modeling/downloads/train.h5.zip\n\nPlease Subscribe!
