description: "So you've built your first HTTP API. Your team has argued for hours about exactly what POST means, you know your GET from your PUT, and you understand why HTTP methods aren't really the same as CRUD operations... and now that it's live, you're suddenly dealing with a whole new set of problems. Do you really need to PUT the entire Customer just to change someone's email address? Why does it take you 25 API calls just to render a shopping cart? How do you find the bottlenecks when just drawing a web page requires fifty HTTP requests? What's going to happen to your server when one of your API consumers accidentally tries to GET your entire customer database?\nIn this talk, we'll look at the problems of running ReSTful APIs in the real world, and the architectural patterns that exist to help us solve those problems. We'll talk about hypermedia - how does it work, why does it matter, and why HATEOAS isn't as scary as it sounds. We'll look at resource expansion, and how to use it to reduce your server workload and speed up your client applications. We'll talk about how to implement PATCH properly, how to handle security and authentication for your APIs, and what tools and services exist to help you design, deliver and debug your HTTP APIs."
