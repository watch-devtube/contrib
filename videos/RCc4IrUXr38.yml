language: English
recordingDate: 1450064371
description: "This session discusses how self-service tools at Netflix reflect the company’s freedom and responsibility culture. Although Netflix is often held up as a DevOps culture, it doesn’t use those words internally. The presentation addresses what Netflix actually does in this regard, and you can decide whether you think this fits any pattern in your mind. Developers operate what they write, and they are paged if their service goes down. With freedom being aligned with responsibility, developers are motivated to make the best technical decisions, rooted in what’s best for the business. You are invited challenge yourself throughout the session to consider how your company can benefit from keeping developers close to deployment, even if you don’t call it DevOps.\n\nSpeaker:\nDianne Marsh, Director of Engineering, Netflix\nDianne Marsh is a Director of Engineering for Netflix in Los Gatos, CA, where she leads a team responsible for tools and systems used by nearly all engineers in the company for continuous integration, delivery and deployment to the AWS cloud.
