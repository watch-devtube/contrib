recordingDate: 1462991120
description: "Modern front-end development has become a tangle of fast-moving technologies. Our job is to implement HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript, but with over 200,000 JavaScript projects on NPM alone, how do you find and learn about the best tools and techniques? And even after we've learned a new tool, it can feel like our skills are soon out-dated.\n\nHow do you keep from sucking at this job?\n\nI've been doing front-end development for 23 years and in this session we will be going over the core principles for learning and improving our front-end skills. Then we'll go through six easy pieces that describe the essentials of front-end development. With numerous linked resources, you'll be able to tackle one piece at a time to modernize your own front-end practices.\n\nThe six easy pieces:\n\nThe Component\nThe Twig, the Sass and the Fugly\nNoodling with JavaScript Tooling\nStyle Guides at the Center\nTesting for Success\nBudgeting for Performance\nIn going through the material, we'll touch on BEM, libSass, KSS, Gulp.js, autoprefixer, Eslint, sass-lint, npm and more."
