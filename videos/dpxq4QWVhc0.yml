description: "Chances are that if you work in software, you spend time building applications. Between features, deadlines and bug fixes, it's easy to move performance to be \"\"nice to have\"\". But what do you do when user interactions drop off, and users start complaining? Instead of having a traditional, reactive approach to performance — what if we could be proactive instead? What if we could monitor performance continuously, and make informed decisions on which issues to tackle. In this talk, I would like to focus on continuous performance monitoring to tell a story of user interactions. We will look into working with Performance API in your environment, and give you simple methods to tell and read a story of your transactions. We will specifically take a look at creating timings, working with observers, and tracking transactions from frontend to backend.\n\nIrina is a Berlin via London via Vancouver (geeeez grrrl) software developer who is, oh hey, hello, really into Node.js. She writes the coolest of nodes over at scripto.cc and contributes to a few OSS projects. Away from the computer, she is exploring the outdoors, gushing over trains and likely at a ramen shop™ reading some Beatniks.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 27 January 2018\n\nSource: https://2018.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
