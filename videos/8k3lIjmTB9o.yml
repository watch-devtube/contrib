description: "As more and more devices become online, information security becomes of higher importance. Since most of the IoT devices are capable of getting personal data about us, it is getting more and more important to design a device which will be resilient to hacker attacks and will protect our information from their uncontrolled exposure. \n\nDuring this discussion, we’ll speak about basics of security mechanisms used in modern embedded devices and how to use them properly. We’ll also speak about our security approach in creating IoT devices which utilizes HW and SW modules in order to provide secure device that will protect our data from exposure and installation of malicious applications that will allow unauthorized use of our device. \n\nBlagoj Kupev is an Embedded Systems enthusiast with more than 15 years of experience in designing embedded systems for diverse technology domains for large companies who are major players in mobile technology. During his engagement in design and development of embedded solutions, he’s been focused with a significant part of his time on digital security and creation of secure and robust systems for installation of software from trusted sources only. Besides these areas of interest, he’s expertise also covers secure booting of embedded devices which is one of the most significant element in creation of secure systems. \n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
