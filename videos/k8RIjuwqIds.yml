title: 'Flink Forward 2016: Julian Hyde - Streaming SQL'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474796211
description: "http://flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/streaming-sql/\n\nStreaming is necessary to handle data rates and latency, but SQL is unquestionably the lingua franca of data. Is it possible to combine SQL with streaming, and if so, what does the resulting language look like? Apache Calcite is extending SQL to include streaming, and Apache Flink is using Calcite to support both regular and streaming SQL. In this talk, Julian Hyde describes streaming SQL in detail and shows how you can use streaming SQL in your application. He also describes how Calcite’s planner optimizes queries for throughput and latency."
