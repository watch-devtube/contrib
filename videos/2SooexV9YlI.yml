description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2017 #flinkforward\n\nDr. Radu Tudoran, Big Data expert at Huawei \n\nHuawei Cloud Stream Service uses Flink internally. Cloud Stream firstly uses Flink as an internal job executing engine. Kinesis use Storm, Alibaba Stream Compute service use Storm. At the end of this year we will support Flink run on the kubernetes and Mesos at cloud, also CEP on SQL and other features. The presentation will show how to create a serverless cloud service from zero, how to provide streaming features with Flink, how to operate the service with quantization and visualization (by collecting yarn/flink/os metrics in real-time). This service was developed from zero and only cost around three months.\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/FlinkForward/flink-forward-berlin-2017-dr-radu-tudoran-huawei-cloud-stream-service-in-practice\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
