title: 'O''Reilly Webcast: 3D Printing for Everyone - What You Need to Know to Get Started'
recordingDate: 1381882832
description: "In this webcast, Ed will introduce you to his open source 3D Printer that he built from a kit. He'll share his experiences of both joy and tears, from assembly and tuning, to modeling and printing. We'll cover the kinds of open source models, compare their commercial counterparts, talk about heat, plastic types and potential. If you are curious about 3D printing, but don't know much about it, I hope to cover all of the basics. If you have been doing your research, but have some pointed questions that will get you off the fence, I hope to answer those too. By the end of the session, my hope is you will all want to build 3D printers of your own, and have all of the information you need to get started.\n\nAbout Ed Snajder\n\nEd Snajder is the Database Administrator at Jive Software.
