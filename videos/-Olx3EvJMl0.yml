recordingDate: 1297785754
description: "By Michael Meeks \r\n\r\nLibreOffice is the most powerful and viable Free Softare office suite, available cross-platform. As well as a few demos showing its joys, we'll understand the history, and rational behind the LibreOffice project and its relation to OpenOffice.org.\r\n\r\nWe will survey the threat to the Free Software ecosystem that poorly managed, corporate dominated, copyright assignment based projects can cause. Then we'll get stuck into new features, our development roadmap, and how to get involved develping with it - even if you are not (yet) a super-star hacker. Come and get involved with something exciting, and help make tens of millions of user's first experience of Free Software something to be proud of.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
