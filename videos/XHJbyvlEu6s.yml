description: "3,5 years ago I was a “cool-Java-hacker”. Suddenly I decided to learn a course “FunProg in Scala”. It blew my mind! I felt I’m a Junior in Scala, but I had no willing to come back to Java… so I needed a job in Scala.\n\nBut who needs a newbie without commercial experience but with Senior’s ambitions? Thus I started searching for lifehacks: how to mobilize my energy and learn the new programming paradigms in a short time. I found them. And eventually it developed into a system that I use to this day. My talk is about this system of continuous self-education."
