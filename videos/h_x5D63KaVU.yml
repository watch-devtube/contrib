We’ll share stories from our experience in startups and enterprises, the mistakes we made along the way and how we came to the realisation we needed to approach building products differently.\n\nWe aim for you to leave knowing how to practically apply an experimental approach to your product development, how to create a culture of experimentation and to recognise the dangers of launching without learning first.\n\nOli Gibson \nFrom ThoughtWorks\nOli Gibson has worked with companies, across all sectors, helping them build better products. He has been an entrepreneur, developer and is now a Product & Strategy Consultant at ThoughtWorks. After several startups, his focus shifted towards the enterprise where he now helps organisations transform their business strategy, take an experimental approach to product development and manage cultural transformation.\n\nMonira Rhaimi \nFrom Thoughtworks\nMonira Rhaimi has worked across multiple roles from software engineer to product manager, in different regions of the world. Having experienced many different environments, teams and cultures, she developed a passion for product management, lean and agile practices and culture change in organisations.
