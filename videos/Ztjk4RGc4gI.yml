description: "Speaker: Fred George (@fgeorge52), Consultant @ Fred George Consulting\n\nMicroService Architectures has debuted on the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar as the first technology they address, and with strong recommendations to immediately experiment. In this talk, we discuss the challenges we have faced at three different companies in implementing MicroServices (successfully!), and the different ways we addressed the challenges.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nFred George is a developer and co-founder at Outpace Systems, and has been writing code for over 45 years in (by his count) over 70 languages. He has delivered projects and products across his career, and in the last decade alone, has worked in the US, India, China, and the UK. He started ThoughtWorks University in Bangalore, India, based on a commercial programming training program he developed in the 90's. An early adopter of OO and Agile, Fred continues to impact the industry with his leading-edge ideas, most recently advocating Micro-Service.\n\nArchitectures and flat team structures (under the moniker of Programmer Anarchy). Oh, and he still writes code!\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/player/c9e39df612924c009fa259c651e56b34?feature=oembed\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.agilesingapore.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/XvTH/"
