description: "Robotics is a vast field of study, encompassing theories across multiple scientific disciplines. In this video, we'll program a robotic arm in a simulated environment to pick up an object. Along the way, we'll learn about both forward and inverse kinematics. We'll optimize our arms trajectory using calculus and observe how its angles change over time, measuring them with trigonometry. We'll code this in Python, this is an example of machine learning applied to robotic manipulation.
