description: 'Today we see how enterprise technology stack transitions from monolithic application servers into horizontally scalable microservices. Simple service-oriented architectures evolve into microservice approaches. Spring Cloud is an umbrella project that enables quick development and delivery of microservices and cloud ready systems.
