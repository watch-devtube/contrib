description: "For years human needed to understand computers and learn how to use them to get the result they wanted. Nowadays, this model has been flipped and computers are trying to understand human conversations.\n\nLatest data indicates that messenger apps have been used more than social networking websites. Are you prepared to leverage from this behavioural change?\nChatbot increases the customer engagement and improves customer experience by focusing on the simplicity. It provides personalised content and an intuitive experience.\nIn this session Microsoft Technical Evangelists Jordan and Azadeh will walk you through conversational UI concepts and Cognitive Services; what they are and the problems they solve before we delve into the new world of easily accessible intelligent services, framed by modern development techniques."
