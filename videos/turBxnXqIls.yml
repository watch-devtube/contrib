language: English
recordingDate: 1498237810
description: "In this inspirational talk, Emmanuel Schanzer, from education charity BootstrapWorld.org, discusses how Computer Science is taught in a variety of ways in high schools across the USA.  There are issues of rigor, equity and scale that are not addressed equally well by many existing solutions.  He argues that we should approach CS education as an engineering problem and not focus on the tool (programming language) and he explains why BootstrapWorld decided to introduce CS as a part of Algebra classes, a move which has been highly successful.\n\nSpeaker:  Emmanuel Schanzer, Bootstrapworld.org"
