description: "P to V to C: The Value of Bringing “Everything” to Containers - Cornelia Davis, Pivotal\n\nRoughly twenty years ago VMware began a revolution in how IT systems would be managed. While initially used for only a small subset of their applications, eventually enterprises would move the vast majority of ALL workloads into virtual machines – many had “P(hysical) to V(irtual)” initiatives to accelerate the movement.\n\nToday we stand at a similar crossroad with the widespread availability of container-based systems and particularly, with the extraordinary embrace and expansion of the Kubernetes ecosystem. Similar to the early days of infrastructure virtualization, organizations are already realizing benefits from containerization of some of their workloads. The question then is, first, how much of an enterprise IT portfolio can benefit can and should be moved into container-based platforms and second, what are the new tools and processes needed to fully realize those advantages? Together, Cloud Foundry Application Runtime (CFAR) and Cloud Foundry Container Runtime (CFCR) can capture “everything.”\n\nIn this session, we will examine the benefits that containerization can bring over and above that of the traditional infrastructure virtualization – the Devops efficiencies that come from the container image are only the beginning. We’ll also study the important role that infrastructure virtualization continues to play in a containerized IT ecosystem – just as virtualization did not eliminate physical machines, nor does containerization eliminate virtual machines. We’ll study containers, pods, controllers, policies and more – the building blocks of the next generation IT landscapes – and the new practices they enable.\n\nBy the end of the session, you’ll be starting to think about your V(irtual) to C(ontainer) initiative.\n\nAbout Cornelia Davis\nCornelia Davis is Vice President of Technology at Pivotal, where she works on the technology strategy for both Pivotal and for Pivotal customers. Currently she is working on ways to bring the various cloud-computing models of Infrastructure as a Service, Application as a Service, Container as a Service and Function as a Service together into a comprehensive offering that allows IT organizations to function at the highest levels.
