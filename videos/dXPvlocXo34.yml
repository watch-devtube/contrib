title: 'Accelerating Tensorflow with Apache Arrow on Spark (Holden Karau)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538069560
description: "Holden, an open source developer advocate at Google, discusses how the Apache Arrow is new in Spark 2.3, and offers faster interchange between Spark and Python. Apache Arrow also has connections to Tensorflow (and even without those can be fed from Pandas). This talk will look at how to use Arrow to accelerate data copy from Spark to Tensorflow, and how to expose basic functionality in Scala for working with Tensorflow. From there we will dive in to how to construct new Deep Learning ML pipeline stages in Python and make them available to be used by our friends in Scala land.\n\nLearn more here: https://databricks.com/session/accelerating-tensorflow-with-apache-arrow-on-spark-bonus-making-it-available-in-scala\n\n \n\nArticle you might like: https://databricks.com/session/scaling-machine-learning-at-booking-com-with-h2o-sparkling-water-and-featurestore"
