description: 'Russ Miles is Chief Scientist at Simplicity Itself where he specialises in working with his clients to help deliver simple and valuable software that thrives on change. “Complexity is the silent killer of delivering the right software, or change, at the right time; it is singly responsibly for killing many good ideas and companies. A focus on simplicity is the answer, but simplicity is not easy. Through our techniques and practices, I help software delivery organisations and teams ensure their solutions are as simple as possible while not missing the mark by over-simplifying.” – Russ Miles, Formation of Simplicity Itself, 2013 Russ’ experience covers almost every facet of software delivery having worked across many different domains including Financial Services, Publishing, Defence, Insurance and Search. With over 18 years experience of consultancy, coaching and training, Russ helps to change all facets of the software delivery process in order to remove unnecessary and costly complexity in everything from developer skills and practices, through applying the right processes for the job at hand, to ensuring that the right change is delivered, be it through software or otherwise. In recent times Russ has brought the principles of antifragility to software architecture and design, including but not limited to how to implement microservice and reactive software. Passionate about open source software, Russ worked with SpringSource prior to the company’s acquisition by VMware, leading the Spring Extensions project and helping international clients to simplify their software by effectively applying the Spring portfolio of projects. Continuing on from this work, Russ founded the Esper Extension project for applying CEP to Spring Integration messaging and pioneered the Spring Koans open source, test-driven personal learning project. Russ continues to be involved in the Spring community, regularly speaking on Spring and is the lead of the Spring User Group in London. Russ is also an international speaker on techniques for helping software adapt to the ever-present force of change as well as a published author, most recently of “Head First Software Development” from O’Reilly Media. He is lead on the London Microservices User Group and heads-up the new µCon conference. Russ’ current book is being published using the LeanPub platform and is titled “Antifragile Software: Building Adaptable Software with Microservices”. The book will be completed in time for the first initial run of the accompanying course, “Russ Miles’ Building Antifragile Software with Microservices”, now available through Skills Matter.'
