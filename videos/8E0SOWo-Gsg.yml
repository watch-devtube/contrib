It is still\nmore or less work in progress and currently targets FreeBSD only but will be\nported to Linux and other operating systems supporting Wayland once it has\nreached some degree of stability and feature completeness.\nThis talk covers:\n\n\n❮ul❯\n❮li❯a brief explanation regarding differences between X and Wayland❮/li❯\n❮li❯some of ❮code❯hikari❮/code❯'s design goals and motivation❮/li❯\n❮li❯choice of programming language❮/li❯\n❮li❯an overview of libraries that were used❮/li❯\n❮li❯tools for ensuring code quality and robustness❮/li❯\n❮li❯obstacles❮/li❯\n❮li❯resources that helped me to implement the whole thing❮/li❯\n❮/ul❯\n\n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 14:25:00"
