description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Owen Rubel\nEssential Grails Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/api-abstraction\nAPI abstraction is the separation of cross cutting concerns related to the api to better enable externalization to architectural concerns. Not only does this enable easier externalization, synchronization and sharing of the environment with external architecture but this also enables us to reload the api configuration on the fly, have DRY'r code, easier batching, api chaining, reduced code, synchronized configuration/security, reduced throughput and much more."
