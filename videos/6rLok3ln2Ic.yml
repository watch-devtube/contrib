description: "Is JDBC still a relevant API that a Java developer should bother learning? We'll review what has been happening in the world of JDBC lately and how it fits with the latest trends like Reactive, Non-Blocking APIs, Microservices, CQRS and Event Sourcing. Back in the days when we were writing monoliths it seemed like Hibernate and JPA where the obvious choices for accessing the database and JDBC was the API used by these frameworks. Now that we are moving towards different application architectures we see more and more examples using the classic `JdbcTemplate` for large portions of the database code. This talk will give a whirlwind tour of the basics of the Spring JDBC support and then give an overview how it fits in with these new architectural styles.\n\nThomas Risberg, Staff Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
