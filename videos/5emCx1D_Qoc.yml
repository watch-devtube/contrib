description: "In recent years the Open Data movement has exploded as governments and public agencies publish more and more diverse data. Public transport data is probably the most well known, consumed by any number of applications to help you get from point A to point B, but much other information is available: crime statistics, pollution levels, traffic accidents, real-time 911 calls.\n\nFinding an interesting data set is only the beginning, the next challenge is doing something interesting. One approach is to map data into Neo4J and visualize the relationships in the Neo4J browser and query the data to show interesting subsets.\n\nThis presentation will introduce you to the Open Data movement and provide places to start for finding something of interest. I'll then use one to populate Neo4J with nodes and relationships via Java and then show the results in the Neo4J browser."
