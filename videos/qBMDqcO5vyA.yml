description: "Learning and exploring languages have changed, every new feature, programming language begins with the search. As learning programming basics have become more online based than physical, how do we account for the ease acquisition. How do you make learning a new language exciting to all developers?\n\nIn my talk, I would like to introduce you the core principals I have learned in creating exciting documentation and online developer experience that enable all developers to be successful in the browser. How do we get our developers excited about learning C# and .NET without ever having to leave the browser? I will show some of the work we have been doing on the .NET team to make these experiences happen."
