description: "Kotlin is one of those 'new' JVM languages that are currently rocking\nthe boat. Although it’s made a great impact on Android, it’s equally good on the\nserver side. As Domain-Specific Languages are constrained by the language they run\non, Kotlin frees developers from Java fluent builders to propose something better.\nTaking the example of a Vaadin UI DSL, I’ll demo how one could design its own DSL\nwith Kotlin."
