Join Spring Test component lead Sam Brannen in this talk to discover what's new in Spring's testing support in 4.0 through 4.1.\n\nThis talk will provide attendees an overview of what's been deprecated, what's changed, and what's been introduced in Spring's testing support over the last two years, with real life examples and tips for best practices. Highlights include using SocketUtils to scan for free TCP & UDP server ports, the ActiveProfilesResolver API, meta-annotation support for test annotations including attribute overrides, best practices with TestNG, using Groovy scripts to configure an ApplicationContext for integration tests, improvements to SQL script execution and embedded databases, the new TestContext framework bootstrap strategy, programmatic transaction management in tests, and more."
