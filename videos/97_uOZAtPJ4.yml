As an on-call engineer, scaling processes among humans is an important problem to solve. How do we ramp up new engineers effectively? How can we bring existing on-call engineers up to speed? In this workshop we'll share common myths among new on-call engineers and the Do's and Don'ts of on-call onboarding, as well as run through hands-on activities you can take back to work and apply directly to your own on-call processes.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
