description: "The future is now. Implants the size of a grain of rice are being used by people to open doors, hold payment information and where a handshake can literally exchange digital business cards. We are also seeing major advances in medical tech with new smaller hearing aids with Wi-Fi, AR/VR to help the visually impaired and even Wi-Fi enabled hearts. We now need to look at the connected human and see how the threat landscape is changing. Soon it may be possible for you to get a computer virus.\n\nEVENT:\n\nØredev 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nNiall Merrigan\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nØredev Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
