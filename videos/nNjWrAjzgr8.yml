description: "Experience Report: Running a Distributed System Across Kubernetes Clusters - Alex Robinson, Cockroach Labs \n\nKubernetes makes it easy to run distributed applications, even those that manage persistent state, within the confines of a single cluster. Running the same applications in a multi-region or multi-cloud fashion across multiple Kubernetes clusters, however, is considerably more difficult due to the networking and service discovery problems involved. In this talk, Alex will walk through his team’s experience over the last six months of running a distributed database across Kubernetes clusters in different regions and their attempts to make the process repeatable on different cloud providers and on-prem environments. He’ll cover common problems they encountered, solutions they’ve tried, how they’re running things today, and the future improvements he’s most excited about from community projects like Istio. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrWK"
