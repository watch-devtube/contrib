title: 'How did our DevOps team become another silo? - Kevin Crawley'
recordingDate: 1543574843
description: "As organizations scramble to innovate they have rapidly begun adopting new technologies, tools, and processes. There has been a need identified to reduce friction between the operations and development teams. A natural tendency for organizations is to form a DevOps team responsible for these tasks. This can quickly become contrary to the DevOps Movement™.\nI’ll discuss how my experience of approaching DevOps not as a team effort but instead as a discipline by embedding developers within individual teams who are dedicated to continuously improving the delivery of software. As the quality of software delivery improves these development resources are free to explore enhancing the quality of engineering efforts in roles which have been appropriately coined Site Reliability Engineers. I’ll discuss some of the benefits which happen when DevOps no longer is a team or a position but an organic mechanism that is a reflection of how your organization builds and delivers software.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
