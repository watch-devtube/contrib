description: "by Christian Thalinger\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1302/performance_graal.webm\n\n\nRunning Twitter services on Graal has been very successful and saved Twitter a lot of money on datacenter cost. But we would like to run more efficient to reduce cost even more. I mean, who doesn’t? In order to do this we are using our Machine Learning framework called Autotune to tune Graal inlining parameters. This talk will show how much performance improvement we got by autotuning Graal. \n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 13:20:00+01"
