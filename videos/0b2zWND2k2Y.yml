recordingDate: 1473448250
description: "In this talk I will talk about the joint compilation in Groovy as it is provided by the Groovy compiler. I will talk about problems it does solve, and problems this solution does not solve. And I will give an outlook onto a new joint compiler, which will solve some of the existing problems.\n\n Note: The audio is missing the first 5 minutes, and is somewhat distorted."
