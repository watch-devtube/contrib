language: English
recordingDate: 1404807727
description: 'Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) is the next step to writing applications that hit the mark! What makes this technique different is that it engages Stakeholders from start to finish of a project. This is done by writing Specifications by Example in collaboration with all Stakeholders.This presentation will use Cucumber with Groovy to demonstrate how you can apply BDD to your next project. We will look at using Cucumber in context of both Groovy and Grails applications. We will demonstrate how to use Gherkin syntax to write clear Scenarios, write Step Definitions in Groovy, then use Geb to interact with a browser. We will implement the new feature in our Grails application using Spock to test drive our finer grained components. Lastly, we will demonstrate our Cucumber Feature running end-to-end.The purpose of this presentation is to encourage others in the Groovy community to embrace testing with BDD, and to write relevant useful applications.'
