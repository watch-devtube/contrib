description: "Serverless architecture is the new hot. But with a lot of different ways to build applications out there, it's hard to know where to start and what really constitutes a serverless application.\n\nIn this talk, we investigate the tools and processes for building serverless applications using Kotlin for use in mobile applications and IoT projects. We will then deploy our application to AWS Lambda and look at some interesting ways we can consume our serverless apps.\n\nGet ready to learn how serverless Kotlin makes it easier to create backends for your applications.\n\nMarcos is a developer evangelist at Twilio where he serves communities in London and all over Europe. He is passionate about technology and spends a great deal of his time building mobile and web apps, and occasionally connecting them to physical devices.\n\nMarcos is a great believer in open source projects. When he’s not writing open source code, he’s probably blogging about code on https://androidsecurity.info or https://androidthings.rocks. He’s also a great API enthusiast and believes they bring peace to the Software Engineering world."
