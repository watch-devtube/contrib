language: English
recordingDate: 1531681981
description: "This is your introduction to the distributed web in the incarnation of IPFS. A really cool platform that retains the original vision of the web and makes it truly distributed.\n\nFirstly we will go through a couple of problem areas with the current internet infrastructure and how IPFS fits into this vision.\n\nWe will then move on to how IPFS actually works and show some examples with a language running on the JVM. We will look at:\n\nhow the files are fingerprinted, versioned and identified\nhow the network of IPFS nodes finds the relevant data for us\ndecentralized and human friendly addressing with IPNS\nLastly we will look at some typical use cases for IPFS. We will note how it fits rather nicely as a storage option for blockchain applications.\n\nFredrik Rubensson is a mentor and senior developer at Go See Talents - providing key expertise to the startup scene of Stockholm."
