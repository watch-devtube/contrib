description: "The Internet of Things market is poised for exponential growth, but there are still lots of barriers that prevent building a real open Internet of Things. Over the last few years, Eclipse has been growing an ecosystem of open source projects for the Internet of Things that are used in real-world solutions, from smart gateways bridging sensors to the cloud to device management infrastructures or home automation systems. Java is a key enabler for the Internet of Things, and this session provides you with concrete examples of how to build end-to-end solutions with the Eclipse Internet of Things Java stack and projects such as Paho, Kura, SmartHome, Californium, OM2M, Eclipse SCADA, and Concierge.\n\n\nAuthors:\nBenjamin Cabe?\nBenjamin Cabé is IoT evangelist at the Eclipse Foundation.
