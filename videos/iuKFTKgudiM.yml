description: 'Docker containers provide unprecedented speed and simplicity to build, run and ship microservices and applications, but how do you manage images as they progress from development to production? Do you version and monitor them the same way as any other build, and can you manage them with other package types through a single point of universal control? Are you always sure they are secure before deployment? If you want to trust your containers in production, join us and learn how to implement an end-to-end management and security pipeline for Docker images.'
