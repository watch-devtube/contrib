Main goal of this project is to design and build an environment capable of automatically installing Drupal, applying a patch and run unit tests. There were two main objectives I tried to acchieve, first how to create a system that would simplify Drupals patch reviewers work and second would not be hard to use. I will try to present problems I encountered and how the system works.  Credits: Speaker:Rok Zlender"
