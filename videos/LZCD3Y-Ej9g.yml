description: "Speaker: Mario Behling (FOSSASIA)\r\n\r\nSUSI AI is an intelligent Open Source personal assistant. It is capable of chat and voice interaction and to perform actions such as music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, and other real time information. Additional functionalities can be added as console services using external APIs. Susi AI is able to answer questions and depending on the context will ask for additional information in order to perform a desired outcome. The core of the assistant is the SUSI AI server that holds the \"intelligence\" and \"personality\" of SUSI. The Android and web applications make use of the APIs to access information from a hosted server. The SUSI AI code is available on GitHub. Commercial licenses and support is available through the SUSI AI startup.
