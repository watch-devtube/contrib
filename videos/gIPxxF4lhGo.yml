description: "ominik Dary (Adobe)\n\nSelendroid is an open source test automation framework which drives off the UI of Android native and hybrid applications and the mobile web. Tests are written using the Selenium 2 client API. For testing no modification of app under test is required in order to automate it.\n\nThis presentation demonstrates to the audience how easy it is to do mobile test automation. It shows how Selendroid can be used to test native and hybrid Android apps and how the Selenium Grid can be used for parallel testing on multiple devices. Advances topics like extending Selendroid itself at runtime and doing cross platform tests will be covered as well."
