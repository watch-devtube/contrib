description: "Designing and building RESTful APIs isn’t easy. On its surface, it may seem simple – after all, developers are only marshaling JSON back and forth over HTTP, right? Believe it or not, that’s only a small part of the equation. There are many things to keep in mind while building the systems that act as the key to your system.\nIn this session, Spencer will delve into several best practices to keep in mind when designing your RESTful API. Attendees will learn about authentication, versioning, controller/model design, testability, documentation and change management. This session will also explore the do’s and don’t’s of RESTful API management so that you make sure your APIs are simple, consistent, and easy-to-use.Examples will be done using ASP.NET Web API and C#. However, this session will benefit anyone who is or might be working on a RESTful API."
