description: "Building Brilliant Teams: A Minimum Viable Company In 4 Months\n\nPaula Thrasher, Director, Digital Services, CSRA\nKevin Stanley, Senior Software Developer, CSRA\n\nAfter an initial DevOps transformation as a company, we had to grapple with how to scale and grow the talent and workforce to build a NextGen DevOps-minded company of 18,000+ people. We have built a number of programs to expand awareness, encourage growth mindsets, and drive workforce development. We will share the different ways we are working to \"Build Brilliant Teams\" to drive our DevOps transformations.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
