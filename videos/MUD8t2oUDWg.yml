description: "Julien Quintard - Member of Technical Staff, Docker\nQuentin Hocquet - Software Engineer, Docker\n\nKey-value store projects have been widely adopted as a way to store metadata, but also as a low-level construct on top of which can be built more advanced storage solutions from file systems, object storage APIs and more. Unfortunately, most key-value store constructs suffer the same limitations when it comes to scalability, performance, and resilience. Infinit's key-value store takes a different approach, relying on a decentralized architecture rather than a master/slave model while offering strong consistency."
