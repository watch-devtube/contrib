description: "Ludovico Caldara\nComputing Engineer\nCERN\n\nIn a DEV world where everything is built automatically (with Jenkins, Gitlab, Maven...), the developers still struggle to integrate some operational tasks in their build pipelines. Despite tools like Ansible, Puppet and Rundeck are being used by more and more companies, some DBAs need (or want) to keep control over their legacy scripts. How can the developers convince the DBAs to implement some useful REST endpoints without much development effort? In this session I will introduce some ideas for integration between applications, ORDS and operational scripts that will help cooperation between developers and DBAs."
