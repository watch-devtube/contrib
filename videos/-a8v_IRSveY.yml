title: 'Building .NET Microservices — Kevin Hoffmann'
language: English
recordingDate: 1473974654
description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/building-net-microservices\n\nWith the advent of ASP.NET Core, developers can now build cross-platform microservices in .NET. We can build services on the Mac, Windows, or Linux and deploy anywhere--most importantly to the cloud.\n\nIn this session we'll talk about Cloud Native .NET, building .NET microservices, and deploying them to the cloud. We'll build services that participate in a robust ecosystem by consuming OSS servers such as Spring Cloud Configuration Server and Eureka. We'll also show how these .NET microservices can take advantage of circuit breakers and be automatically deployed to the cloud via CI/CD pipelines."
