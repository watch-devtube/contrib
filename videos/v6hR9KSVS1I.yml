description: "Docker + Drupal 8: Spin-up local environment in fast and easy way\n\nSpeaker: Pratomo Ardianto (Ardi)\n\nSo on this meetup I will share with you about what Docker is actually about, how to create a basic Docker configuration, and integrate it with Drupal 8 so you can happily develop cool stuff with Drupal 8 in your local machine, fast and easy way. And perhaps we can discuss some other things too along the way.\n\nArdi is senior web developer working at X-Team. He has years of experience working with Drupal, developing websites for start-up companies to corporates. Ardi is also very active in Drupal Community, and been giving few talks in Drupal Meetups and Drupal Camp Singapore.  \n\nEvent Page: http://www.meetup.com/Drupal-SG/events/235283881/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/08Z2/"
