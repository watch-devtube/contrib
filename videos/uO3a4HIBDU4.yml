description: "Writing and programming are often seen as different. Writing a creative profession, programming a technical one. Below the surface however, there is one large similarity. Both writing and programming are, ultimately, the translation of a high-level idea into low level sentences or statements.\n\nSo, there should be something we can learn from each other, right? In this talk, Felienne will compare the activities of writing and programming, with a focus on learning to read and write, versus learning to program."
