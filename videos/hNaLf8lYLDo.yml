description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nAmongst the loud fanfare of C++11 arrived this quiet little gem of ?system_error?, with std::error_code and std::error_condition born from the heart of boost::asio. With Committee input they evolved for inclusion into the C++11 Standard, providing consistent and extensible ways for applications to expose platform-specific error-codes, platform-independent error-conditions, and rely upon an open-ended design that permits future extensibility for message reporting; and even internationalization of logs and user-facing events and conditions. \n\nMore than half a decade later, we most unhappily find that the motivation and intended use model for std::error_code and std::error_condition are still not well understood; even in circles eagerly embracing features and idioms encouraged by the latest C++ Standard revisions. This may be somewhat expected, as all things “error” tend to permeate system-wide design-decisions and influence the processing metaphor; how algorithms compose conditional success-or-failure branching; and create consistency challenges across APIs (both internally, and for interoperation with third-party libraries). \n\nWe discuss the features and design of ?system_error? and its intended use; make recommendations regarding API design; and propose possible extension mechanisms for module-specific concerns, instance-specific messages (with embedded value-reporting), and internationalization. \n— \nCharles Bay: F5 Networks Inc.\n\nSoftware developer with 25+ years experience in large-scale and distributed systems in performance-sensitive environments including real-time processing, performance visualization, embedded systems, time-sensitive processing of large data sets, hardware status-and-control, and instrument/process/sub-assembly monitoring.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
