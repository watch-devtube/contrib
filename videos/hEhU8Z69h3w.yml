description: "1) Government Security Frameworks: Where Do I Begin?\n\nSPEAKERS: JASON FORD\n\nExperience Level: Beginner \n\nDevelopment companies are becoming more involved in application building for the federal government, but are quickly finding themselves in a security nightmare.\n\nThe acronyms “FedRAMP” and “FISMA” are commonly interjected into every conference call you are on, causing you ask yourself, “How did I get here?” Well, you are not alone … Weaving your way through federal security frameworks for the first time can be extremely difficult and very frustrating.\n\nIn this session, we will discuss these complicated frameworks, and devise different ways to leverage compliant services for your application. We will also review various tools and techniques to apply against your application to meet these framework standards.\n\nIf you have asked any of the following questions, this session is for you:\n\nHow do compliance frameworks apply to my application?\nWhat happens once my application is certified?\nHow can I reuse previous work to achieve compliance for other agencies?\nThis session provides you the basic knowledge of application compliance you will need to successfully navigate the world of government security.\n\n2) Avoid Traffic Jams: The Impact of eCommerce Site Performance on Bottom-Line Results\n\nSPEAKERS: DOUG GOLDBERG\n\nExperience Level: Intermediate\n\nImagine a time when marketing is on its game, the flash sale is ready, 25,000 units have been acquired and 45,000 independent consultants are vying to get a massive reduction on price of a single item. With improper infrastructure and engineering this is a nightmare waiting to happen.  As a matter of fact, prior to coming to Platform.sh this nightmare turned into one companies reality.  Anger, frustration and stress for everyone involved month after month during every flash sale.  Once they moved to a custom engineered site at Platform.sh the nightmare magically disappeared:\n\n“Today’s splurge was downright magical.  Thank you so much for working so hard to lessen the stress and make it so much easier\" - independent consultant\n\nMagic might not be the best word for what was really custom engineering to create a truly scalable infrastructure and understanding where the bottlenecks actually lie for an individual client.  Product lines are important but understanding when it’s time to create a bespoke offering taking into account the client’s specific needs are just as important.\n\nIn this talk - we’ll cover the building blocks and discuss:\n\nHow a 1 second delay in performance can reduce conversion by 7%\n\nRelationship between load time and bounce rate\n\nThe importance of partnering with your client not just providing a service\n\nHow to load test and determine breaking points of code and infrastructure\n\nHow to scale every component of the stack\n\nWhat the git-driven, PaaS Platform.sh will do to increase efficiency and scalability of your eCommerce application.\n\nLearn about the need for speed and stability for eCommerce sites and the infrastructure that hosts and supports them in this case study session."
