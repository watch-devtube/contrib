description: "When you hear about a development studio, you may typically think about a group of industry experts with years of experience and education. But there is a new generation of emerging developers who are not content to wait for college, or even high school to get in the game. As the head of Information Experience on Roblox, Laker Sparks has seen young hobbyist programmers transform into multi-million dollar development teams. In this talk, he will share his learnings and observations about the experiences and challenges of these young developers, and then discuss resources and techniques you can use to help foster this next generation of developers and creators.\n\nhttps://2018.cascadiajs.com/"
