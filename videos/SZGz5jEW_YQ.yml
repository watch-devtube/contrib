title: 'DEF CON 29 Car Hacking Village - Ben Nassi -Remote Adversarial Phantom Attacks on Tesla, Mobileye'
language: English
recordingDate: 1631234866
description: "In this talk, we present \"split-second phantom attacks,\" a scientific gap that causes two commercial advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs), Telsa Model X (HW 2.5 and HW 3) and Mobileye 630, to treat a depthless object that appears for a few milliseconds as a real obstacle/object. \n\nWe discuss the challenge that split-second phantom attacks create for ADASs. \nWe demonstrate how attackers can apply split-second phantom attacks remotely by embedding phantom road signs into an advertisement presented on a digital billboard which causes Tesla’s autopilot to suddenly stop the car in the middle of a road and Mobileye 630 to issue false notifications. We also demonstrate how attackers can use a projector in order to cause Tesla’s autopilot to apply the brakes in response to a phantom of a pedestrian that was projected on the road and Mobileye 630 to issue false notifications in response to a projected road sign."
