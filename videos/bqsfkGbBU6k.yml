description: "Creating 3D Artificial Intelligence in a simulated world is actually pretty easy using Unity 5. It's a powerful tool and I'll go over its new ML Agents toolkit, that allows researchers and developers to build/train ML models in a 3D simulation. It's pretty fun watching it in a 3D world, lets break down the code and concepts. Please Subscribe! That's what keeps me going. \n\nEDIT: I made a mistake, minecraft was not created in Unity, but it has been recreated in Unity countless times. \n\nCode for this video (Please hit the red subscribe button for more):\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Unity_ML_Agents\n\nBrendan's Winning Code:\nhttps://github.com/bhansconnect/alpha_zero_othello\n\nShadman's Runner Up Code:\nhttps://github.com/kudchikarsk/Happines-Prediction\n\nWant more education?
