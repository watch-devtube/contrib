title: 'The Deploy Factory: Open Source Tools for Java Deployment'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433260782
description: "Continuous deployment enables teams to stay in a condition of sustained flow for long periods, making it much easier to innovate, experiment, and achieve long-term productivity. By keeping all environments in the build pipeline, from development to test to production, as similar as possible, you can drastically reduce risks in the development process. Hear about the adventure of this session’s speakers through the Deploy Factory. They present best practices and show open source tools for continuous deployment of Java apps, from Jenkins plug-ins and the Go Continuous Delivery server to the integration of Chef and Vagrant into projects and tools for DevOps such as Flyway and Rundeck. The session also looks into the cloud and virtualization and covers Docker and Packer usage in Java projects.\n\n\nAuthors:\n Bruno Souza\nBruno Souza is a Java Developer and Open Source Evangelist at Summa Technologies, and a Cloud Expert at ToolsCloud.
