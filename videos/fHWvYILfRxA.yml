description: "Evan Smith, SRE at Hosted Graphite\n\nCapacity Planning is a pretty difficult topic to wrap your head around and can seem almost impossible to start with. In this talk, I present the four basic steps to go from monitoring what you have to planning for the future. If you've found yourself woken up at 4 AM to expand nodes to meet demand, it's time to pull away from reactive actions and start proactive capacity planning.\n\nThe goal of the session is to:\n\nProvide an approachable method for capacity planning right now.\nHighlight concerns and considerations before starting your plan.\nExplain how to enforce your plan after you've made it.\nExplain when to re-evaluate your plans and reduce toil.\nRecommend some methods for avoiding common pitfalls engineers/business folk fall into.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
