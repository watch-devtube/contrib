description: "This video shows how the Hello Endpoints Android sample can be built from scratch. I keep  a brisk pace to respect experienced Android developer's time, but it's also accessible to new Android developers who don't mind occasionally pausing.\n\nIt follows this general outline:\n\n1.) Download the Hello Endpoints Java Backend API (http://goo.gl/ndv97M) and start it locally.\n\n2.) Generate an Android-compatible client library for the Backend API.\n\n3.) Setup a basic Android project that has a simple UI.\n\n4.) Add the generated client library and dependencies to the Android project.\n\n5.) Add code that uses the client library in Android.\n\n6.) Test code in an Android emulator.\n\nMake sure to have Maven 3.1+, Git, and Android Studio installed, operational, and updated before attempting to follow the steps in the video.\n\nFull Sample Code can be accessed at this URL: http://goo.gl/Ab8R6r\nThe GitHub Gist code can be accessed at this URL: http://goo.gl/SgxO3W\n\nAs always, please +1, star, or up-vote any of our resources that you find particularly useful and provide feedback!\n\nThanks,\n\nPaul Rashidi \nThe Google Cloud Platform Team"
