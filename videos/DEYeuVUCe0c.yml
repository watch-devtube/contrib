description: "Speaker(s):\nJonathan Alferness; Scott Huffman\n\nDescription:\nContent discovery on mobile isn't easy. Luckily, this is a challenge that Google is well positioned to help you with. With App Indexing on Android, you can engage users organically by surfacing app content in the search results page. And you can even drive app installs for users who don't have your app. Google's smart mobile ads platform gives you access to AdWords, the world's largest network, to find the right users who will install and engage with your app, plus you can gain insights through Google Analytics install attribution to know where your users came from. Discover Google's variety of approaches to driving app discovery, growth and engagement in this session.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2015 videos at: g.co/dev/io15videos.\n\n#io15"
