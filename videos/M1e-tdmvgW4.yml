description: "Codeurs En Seine 2021\n\nShipping less to end-users isn't an easy task. We have to make choices between features, design, accessibility, and performance. Well, we thought we did have to make those choices. But it's less the developers' responsibility than of their dev tools responsibility.\n\nIt's time to get the control back on what we deliver to our users, ensuring them the best experience they may expect without sacrificing the tools we need, the framework we want, or the features we planned. It's time for a new era, and Astro opens the path to it.\n\nAstro is like a static site generator, but it doesn't generate websites. It builds them, removing the useless client-side JS parts. Use whatever (J|T)S(X) framework you want, whatever library you're comfortable with, whatever embedded tool you need. Forgot complex CSS-in-JS stuff. Focus on your skills, but ship plain old-style HTML and CSS to your users. No compromise, no deal-breaker. Just the best of the Web Performance, directly from your toolkit.\n\nLet's take our revenge on the 90's 🚀\n\n--\n\nRejoignez Codeurs en Seine \n▶ Sur Twitch : https://www.twitch.tv/codeursenseine\n▶ Sur Twitter : https://twitter.com/codeursenseine\n▶ Sur Slack :  https://go.codeursenseine.com/slack"
