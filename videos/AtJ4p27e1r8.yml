Kristian Glass\n  \nAssembly Room 2018-09-18 12:30-13:00\n  \nHiring is hard, it's hard to do well, it's easy to do badly. Here's some things to avoid!\n\nMaybe you control hiring decisions at work, maybe you're an interviewer or applicant reviewer, or maybe you're trying to be hired somewhere - chances are you're exposed to the hiring process somehow.\n\nThere's so many things you can do that are inadvertently problematic, and they're so easy to do without realising.\n\nI'll show you a selection of things that people do, with all the best intentions, and the problems that can arise, so you can avoid them and do better!"
