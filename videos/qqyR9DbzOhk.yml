description: "Despite the fact that we have left behind us the industrial revolution era, the majority of IT projects today are managed with a mindset and with practices that are more appropriate for repetitive labor work, rather than the kind of knowledge work that's so typical and our industry.\n\nThis cultural shift is, in fact, one of the biggest challenges for the industry itself and for many managers and teams (assuming there is a team).\n\nIn this session we are going to talk about the major cultural changes in managing knowledge-based projects, such as the strategies and mental models required to deal with a high level of uncertainty. We'll also see why the focus, on this kind of work, shifts to the team rather than the single individuals, why the team is the basic unit of work and which skills are required from the project leaders to work in this kind of ecosystem.\n\nOf course, we'll also talk about practical approaches and techniques that we immediately apply when leading knowledge-based projects.\n\nAbout Andrea\n\nI help IT organizations to implement better ways of doing business; and I coach teams and individuals who want to improve technically and relationally.\n\nAbout Agile Adria conference\n(agileadria.com)\n\nThis video is recorded at Agile Adria conference. Agile Adria is the biggest agile conference in southeastern Europe. It is organized by Agile Croatia, one of the most active agile communities in Europe. It is a regional event, intended to gather agilests from Croatia, Slovenia, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nWe focus on a great content. That's why our speakers are all top level experts from all around Europe and US. Also, to ensure a great content we set up a rule of NO SPONSORED TALK.\nThe second important thing that we pay attention to is networking. We want you to really enjoy during a conference, so our attendees enjoyed things like free wellness, free sauna, great hotel, party with live band etc.\nWelcome to a next Agile Adria conference!"
