title: 'DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: 10 Lessons Clients Teach Me Everyday'
recordingDate: 1462919970
description: "Even after 16 years of managing projects, I still learn from my clients. Each client is a unique snowflake, amazing and challenging all in one little package…or maybe not. It turns out that they aren’t as different as we might think. There are common traits and needs between them all.\n\nIn fact 10 lessons stand out to me as key to building successful client relationships. While I would love to say that I learned them all, I can’t which is why they are so important. They are hard to learn because they involve people.\n\nThe goal of this session it to help remind us all (and share with those who are new) what these lessons are and why they are so important. We will talk about what changes we can make with our overall approach and specific actions to avoid these blunders again.\n\nYou will walk away with heightened project manager-like reflexes that will allow you to avoid these problems in the future. After all, won’t all of us try anything to make it easier to manage those projects and unique client relationships?"
