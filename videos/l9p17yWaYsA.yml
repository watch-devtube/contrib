description: "From WCF to gRPC - Mark Rendle, Gibraltar Software \n\nIn 2006, distributed systems meant Service Oriented Architecture, and SOA meant SOAP. Microsoft created the closed-source, platform-specific Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to enable .NET developers to build SOAP-based applications, services and clients using C# or VB.NET. 15 years later, .NET Core is open source and cross-platform, WCF is being retired, and Microsoft are recommending gRPC as the preferred solution. But can gRPC do everything that WCF did? In this session, Mark Rendle will look at the different modes and bindings of WCF, like two-way \"duplex\" bindings and server-side sessions, and show how similar functionality can be achieved in gRPC with ASP.NET Core 3.1, with all the performance and interoperability benefits of the gRPC protocol."
