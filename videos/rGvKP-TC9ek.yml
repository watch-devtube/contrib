The interaction styles made possible by these tools promote characteristics and values that are poised to help change how a broader set of knowledge workers go about their daily jobs.

In this talk, I will describe how the social code graph that can be surfaced from collaboration between developers is poised to further transform software development and knowledge work.\n\nFor more on YOW!
