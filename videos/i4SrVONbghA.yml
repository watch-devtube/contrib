description: "Tutorial: Deploying Windows Apps with Draft, Helm and Kubernetes - Patrick Lang & Jessica Deen, Microsoft (Limited Seating Available - See Description for Details) \n\nIn this session, we'll go through two key workflows:1) How to deploy and manage a Windows-based application on Kubernetes We'll start with an already-built Windows application in a container, and walk through a simple deployment on Kubernetes. Along the way, we'll go over some of the key considerations such as handling secrets, required node selectors, and other common differences you may encounter in clusters with Windows & Linux nodes. This section does not require access to a Windows machine, only a browser, ssh & kubectl will be required.2) Building an end-to-end workflow with Draft & HelmOnce you understand how to deploy a Windows application with Kubernetes, we can move on to setting up the full developer workflow. We'll create a new app using .Net Core on Windows, scaffold and deploy with Draft. This requires Windows 10 (laptop or VM running on Azure or VMWare Fusion) \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrRU"
