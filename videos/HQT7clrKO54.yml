description: "( Apache Spark Training - https://www.edureka.co/apache-spark-scala-training )\nApache Spark Blog Series: https://goo.gl/WrEKX9\n\nApache Spark, developed by Apache Software Foundation, is an open-source big data processing and advanced analytics engine. It allows developers to develop applications in Scala, Python and Java. This video provides detailed knowledge about various features of this high-speed cluster-computing framework and also Scala, the language in which Spark has been written. \n\nCourse Objectives\n\nAfter completing the Apache Spark & Scala course, you will be able to:\n1) Understand Scala and its implementation\n2) Apply Control Structures, Loops, Collection, and more. \n3) Master the concepts of Traits and OOPS in Scala \n4) Understand functional programming in Scala \n5) Get an insight into the big data challenges \n6) Learn how Spark acts as a solution to these challenges \n7) Install Spark and implement Spark operations on Spark Shell \n8) Understand the role of RDDs in Spark \n9) Implement Spark applications on YARN (Hadoop) \n10) Stream data using Spark Streaming API \n11) Implement machine learning algorithms in Spark using MLlib API \n12) Analyze Hive and Spark SQL architecture \n13) Implement SparkSQL queries to perform several computations\n14) Understand GraphX API and implement graph algorithms \n15) Implement Broadcast variable and Accumulators for performance tuning\n\nProject Work\n\nProject #1: Design a system to replay the real time replay of transactions in HDFS using Spark.\nTechnologies Used: \n1. Spark Streaming\n2. Kafka (for messaging)\n3. HDFS (for storage)\n4. Core Spark API (for aggregation)\n\nProject #2: Drop-page of signal during Roaming \nIndustry: Telecom Industry \nProblem Statement: You will be given a CDR (Call Details Record) file, you need to find out top 10 customers facing frequent call drops in Roaming. This is a very important report which telecom companies use to prevent customer churn out, by calling them back and at the same time contacting their roaming partners to improve the connectivity issues in specific areas.\n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US : 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India : +91-8880862004"
