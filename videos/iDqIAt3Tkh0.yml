description: "TrustToken is a platform to create asset-backed tokens that you can easily buy and sell around the world. For example, gold to gold tokens or dollar to dollar tokens. We need a stablecoin, and Trusttoken's TrueUSD acts as that. Its pegged to the US dollar, so it provides all of the benefits of cryptocurrency without the volatility. As we move forward into Web 3.0, we need a way to bridge the traditional and crypto financial worlds together. TrustToken does just that, and its why I agreed to work with them (Paid) on this video. I'll go over the architecture, theory, and build a simple solidity smart contract to show that its very doable to build something like this yourself.
