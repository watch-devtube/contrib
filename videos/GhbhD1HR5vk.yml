I will NOT be teaching object orientation principles in general - this video series is for you if you’re already pretty familiar with object orientation, but confused around how it works in JavaScript specifically. At the end of this series, you’ll be a lot less confused about the prototype, classes, bind,  Object.create, modules, factories, constructors and so on.\n\nObject Creation in JavaScript\nhttps://goo.gl/KFeTFN\n\nHigher-order functions in JavaScript\nhttps://goo.gl/3aTDR6"
