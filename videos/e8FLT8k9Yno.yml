title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Launching Online Stores with Commerce 2.x on Drupal 8'
recordingDate: 1493180072
description: "Drupal Commerce 2.x for Drupal 8 entered its beta phase in September 2016 and is rapidly advancing toward a full release\_thanks to contributors from around the world. In this session we present the project's history, architecture, and features, highlighting the changes that have made this version even more productive for building online stores.\n\nTo support Commerce 2.x development, Commerce Guys first released several standalone PHP libraries (e.g. for\_currency formatting\_and\_addressing)\_and then created\_modules that make use of them, such as the new\_Address\_module. Finally, we rebuilt Drupal Commerce itself from the ground up, taking full advantage of Drupal 8's new features\_-- and even improving them in turn!\n\nCome learn how we've engineered\_Commerce 2.x to make it simpler to solve some of the hardest parts of eCommerce and removed the need for over 20 contributed modules along the way.\n\nUsing client sites we helped go live\_as examples, we will discuss\_and demonstrate\_topics including:\n\nInstalling Drupal Commerce and its dependencies\nCreating and configuring one or multiple stores\nAdding product pages and their variants\nCustomizing Add to Cart forms and Line Items\nConfiguring multiple custom Checkout flows\nManaging Payment methods and their new UI\nManaging\_Orders and their workflows\nWe'll close with an overview of the roadmap and status of the contributed module ecosystem, which has seen a lot of early development in payment integrations and shipping capabilities. We'll make sure everyone knows how to start\_contributing\_- there's always more to do! ; )\n\nYou do not need prior experience with Drupal Commerce to attend, but some familiarity with Drupal 8 and common challenges in\_eCommerce will help you get the most out of the material."
