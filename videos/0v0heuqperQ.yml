As we build the app, you'll learn the basics of creating a SplitViewController-based app, and how to implement a simple XML reader to read an XML feed, display a list of article titles and load an article into the detail view when its title is tapped in the list.\r\n\r\nFor more information about O'Reilly training, contact training@oreilly.com\r\n\r\nClick here to view this article on OReilly.com: http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2010/04/splitviewcontroller-ipad-xml.html"
