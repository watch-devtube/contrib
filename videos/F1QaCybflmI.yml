description: Years after Kent Beck provided JUnit, unit testing is part of most developer
  teams tooling. However, there's a trend that tends to threaten unit testing, claiming
  only integration testing can truly detects defects in software. In this talk, we
  will first define what unit testing and integration testing are, and their respective
  pros, cons and uses. Then, we will have a look at the unique challenges posed by
  integration testing. Finally, tools and techniques will be presented to somewhat
  remedy to that so that integration testing becomes a true asset in each software
  developer bag of tricks.
