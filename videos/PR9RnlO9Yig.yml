title: 'N-API: The Next Generation Node js API is Ready!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540400864
description: "The Native module ecosystem for Node.js is an important factor in the rapid growth of Node.js. The N-API is now a supported feature and is designed to provide ABI stability across Node.js releases. This will reduce friction in upgrading to newer Node.js versions in production deployments. In addition, it will reduce the maintenance cost that module maintainers previously had to take on due to the fast pace of changes in the v8 APIs. This talk will provide a progress update on this community project, the roadmap, and why now is the right time to get involved.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode+JS Interactive 2018\n\nSPEAKERS:\n\nMichael Dawson, IBM & Arunesh Chandra, Microsoft\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nNodeJS YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQPYJluYC_sn_Qz_XE-YbTQ"
