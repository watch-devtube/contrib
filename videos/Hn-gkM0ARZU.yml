description: 'Promises saved JavaScript from callback hell, but we’re not out of the woods yet. Anybody who’s written heavily asynchronous code knows there’s still pain in the promise’d land, from the flood of extra ceremony required to the frustratingly fractured function scope. Fortunately, this isn’t the end of the line, and with generators and JavaScript''s upcoming async/await syntax we can do even better. In this talk we’ll look at where asynchronous development is going next, how it’s going solve your problems, and what you need to do to put it into practice today.'
