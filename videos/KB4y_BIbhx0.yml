description: "How does a robot interact with a mobile app?\n\nIn this talk, Sam Connelly will demo a robot called Tappy McTapFace based on a opensource tapster 2.0 design interacting with a mobile app but first she will go through her risk based framework that she developed to help her team create UI automation tests that matter. This approach can also be used for manual testing, generating explorative testing ideas and communicating flows & risks to people outside of your team."
