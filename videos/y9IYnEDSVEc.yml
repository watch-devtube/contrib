description: "John Zaccone\n\nIn this talk John Zaccone will present tips and best practices for developing dockerized applications. We will start with the simple question: \"Why Docker?\", then dive into practical knowledge for developers to apply on their own. John will cover best practices concerning Dockerfiles and the best tools to use for developing. We will also talk about the \"hand-off\" between developer and operations and how the two roles can work together to address broad issues such as CI/CD and security. After John's talk, stay tuned for Scott Coulton's talk that will dive deeper into Docker for Ops."
