description: "Working with legacy code is tough: no tests, no documentation, and fear of breaking other parts of the code. The only way to deal with that is to test and refactor merciless.\nFor the majority of us, legacy code is part of our life and learning how to embrace it can make things far more enjoyable. In this live coding session, Sandro will be demonstrating how to overcome the most common problems found when testing legacy code.\nHe will be taking a piece of messy Java code, test it until is 100% covered and then show how to refactor it in order to bring the business language and requirements to life.\nThis session is full of tips and tricks you can start applying immediately. Although the code is in Java, the same principles can be applied in any language.\n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E. Unconference: http://itakeunconf.com\n\nThe organizer of I T.A.K.E. Unconference is Mozaic Works http://mozaicworks.com"
