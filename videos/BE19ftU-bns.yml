description: "What is the ultimate hack of our lives? What is the one thing that we strive to learn the most about? What is the thing that will truly unlock our potentials? What if you could log your brain to the developer console, typing with your brain signals?\n\nThis talk is a demonstration of an open-source Brain-Computer Interface that is completely developed with JavaScript, from the ground up, using neural networks and signal processing. Armagan hits the stage with a wireless EEG headset, shows how to read signals from the brain in JavaScript using native C++ Node.js modules over USB, and the implementation in Electron, Node.js and Vue.js."
