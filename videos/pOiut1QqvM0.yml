description: "Stewart Bryson, Owner and Co-founder, Red Pill Analytics\n\nThis session examines a day in the life of a developer using a cloud-based DevOps environment providing issue tracking, code versioning, team collaboration, Agile project management, and continuous integration and delivery. It begins with Agile development tools for streamlining project management. You’ll experience the full code lifecycle: how it’s versioned, merged, and managed and, ultimately, how artifacts are built and deployed. The presentation examines how the cloud DevOps environment integrates with standard development frameworks such as Git, Gradle, and popular development IDEs. Experience live demos using Oracle Developer Cloud Service, which provides everything needed for polyglot development."
