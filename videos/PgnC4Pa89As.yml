description: "Lightning Talk: Connect from Browsers Using gRPC-Web - Stanley Cheung, Google \n\nWe are delighted to introduce gRPC-Web, a cross-browser javascript library which allows developers to write web applications that connect to gRPC servers. In this lightning talk, we will briefly talk about the gRPC-Web protocol and deployment model. We will also show a quick demo on how easy it is to start writing a browser application with gRPC-Web and Protobuf. With gRPC-Web, you get a very familiar gRPC-style API compared to other languages supported by gRPC. We will also talk about how future holds and what we have planned in the roadmap. \n\nTo learn more: https://sched.co/GrVV"
