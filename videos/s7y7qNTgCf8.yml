description: "Lightning Talk presented by Julian Fischer, CEO, Anynines.\n\nThere is no doubt, continuous integration has improved software quality significantly. By automating test execution after changing code, tests are run immediately and alerts raised in case something has broken.\n\nHowever, the tool chain is often not fully integrated, yet. In case a build fails, it is still up to the dev team to find and fix the cause of failure.\n\nLeaving this crucial part of the dev chain without automation, a developer could still simply ignore results of the CI process and deploy untested code to a production system.\n\nThe logical next step is obvious. Only successfully tested code may be deployed. Automated or even enforced. Continuous deployment is about achieving this goal and fully integrating CI with your deployment process."
