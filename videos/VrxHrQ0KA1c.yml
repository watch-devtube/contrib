description: "Last month, Strata Rx Program Chair Colin Hill, of GNS Healthcare, sat down with Dr. Dennis Ausiello, Jackson Professor of Clinical Medicine at the Harvard Medical School, Co-Director at CATCH, Pfizer Board of Directors Member, and Former Chief of Medicine at MGH, for a fireside chat at a private reception hosted by GNS. Their insightful conversation covered a range of topics that all touched on or intersected with the need to create smaller and more precise cohorts, as well as the need to focus on phenotypic data as much as we do on genotypic data.\n\nCATCH brings together a dedicated group of faculty from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Massachusetts Institute of Technology to undertake the next great venture in human health: the discovery and application of new ways to quantitatively measure the human condition (phenotypes) in health and disease. At a time when medicine is at the crossroads between the promise of the genomic revolution and the pressures of health care delivery, these human measurements or phenotypes will serve as the linchpin to transform patient care, scientific innovation and human health."
