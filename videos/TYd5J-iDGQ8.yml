description: "The First 50 Nodes... The Story Of Our Journey At A Windows-Centric Enterprise by Scott Nasello\n\nIn this talk we’ll discuss our own journey at Columbia Sportswear including: * Overcoming the “yeah windows can already do everything you want us to do” * Overcoming the “we don’t run Linux and this can’t work here” * Getting Engineers to buy in that they current skillset will not sustain them * Finding a couple of early adopters * Finding allies (peers) in the organization * Using a series of experiments to incrementally converge on version control, exposing work, kanbans, demos, etc. * Optimizing the automation to be as inviting as possible (yes we did some hard coding at times) * Starting the organization on the path to becoming a learning organization * Tempering enthusiasm to keep the entire team moving forward\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/LWIv/"
