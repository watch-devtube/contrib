description: "For those familiar with the teachings of Uncle Bob, Clean Architecture is no stranger. It's a set of architectural guidelines that provide a SOLID set of principes on which to base you architecture in order to have a clean, easy to understand and even easier to maintain foundation. This talk will show you how you can implement such an design and will demonstrate the power of such a design. It will also show how you can be pragmatic in implementing Clean Architecture and what the possible implications can be when making pragmatic concessions. I'll also show what features Kotlin has that makes implementing Clean Architecture a breeze, mitigating some of the concerns.\n\nLieven Doclo\nA Java developer for 10 years, Java has little secrets for Lieven. His interests are microservices and IoT. He's currently working as a freelance software consultant, where he's keeping up to speed with the latest technologies and driving clean architectural principes wherever and whenever he can."
