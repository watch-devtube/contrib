description: "I have been involved in both software development work and managing units which do software development for more than 40 years. During that time software technology and tools have evolved dramatically. \n\nThere are many factors which influence how a software development project should be run:\n\n    Size of the project\n    New development or addition of functionality to existing software system\n    Detailed specification or woolly specification\n    Experience and skill of the developers available\n    Required development time\n    Needed software technology\n\nYou have to adapt to way projects are managed to these and many other factors. Trying to run all software development projects in the same way is a bad idea!"
