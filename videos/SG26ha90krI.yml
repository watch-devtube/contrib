Submit your proposals here:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BFOO1Q6U1V0Nns2zsFRWphHA3_3T0BimKbhdjkgBxCY\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you've ever visited Hacker News, you've almost certainly seen the \"Show HN\" or \"Ask HN\" posts. Well, it's time to get off the Internet and tell us about it face to face. We'll provide you with our honest feedback, you provide us with a great hack, or idea.\r\n\r\nWe'll give you 5 minutes to show off your tool, hack, library (did you just write a library to access the Meetup API in Go!?), whatever. We're language and software/hardware agnostic, so it's all fair game.\r\n\r\nWe encourage presentations of any kind on projects that people work on for fun, for the love of all things technical. The only rules are\r\n1) no startup pitches and\r\n2) no work projects (unless it solves a general problem and is open sourced).\r\n\r\nTalk slots are 10 minutes long (*5 minutes of presentation* and 5 minutes of Q&A). First-time speakers and of underrepresented groups in tech are welcome! We'd be glad to help you prepare for your talk.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n\r\n6:30p - 7:00p: Dinner (will be provided)\r\n7:00p - 8:00p: Lightning Talks\r\n8:00p - 9:00p: Meet the speakers + mingling\r\n\r\nFood:\r\n\r\nFood will be provided.
