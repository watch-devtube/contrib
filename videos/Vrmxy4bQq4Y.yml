description: "by Ognyan Chikov\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1302/etherlime.webm\n\n\nWith Etherlime we aim to solve issues in the deployment of smart contracts and to allow developers to write their own scripts. This way they are not constrained to just the deployment transactions but also they can use the newly deployed contracts right away as part of the initialization sequence. \n\nIn September 2018 our project received funding from Ethereum foundation, Ethereum community fund and ETHPrize. Etherlime is an Ethereum development and deployment framework based on ethers.js created by our team in LimeChain. The framework was born out of necessity, hardships, and trouble in the development and deployment of ethereum smart contract. We are trying to ease the pain of deployment, compilation and unit testing and add much-needed stability to the process. In our mind ethers.js is a much more stable alternative than web3.js for the moment, and this is one of the main reasons why we created it. \n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:20:00+01"
