title: 'YOW! Connected 2015 Sally Shepard - Implementing Inclusive Interfaces'
language: English
recordingDate: 1461372011
description: "As mobile developers, accessibility often gets pushed aside. For people with disabilities, the communication tools we take for granted are often denied to them. I want to talk about ways of building new interfaces to enable inclusivity and expand peoples understanding of the complex landscape of users with accessibility needs.\n\nIt’s obviously not easy to make mobile apps accessible - otherwise more apps would be. Over the past few years, apps have become more complex and accessibility has suffered.\n\nThrough research, user testing and experimentation, I’ve found ways to speed up the process of making a mobile app accessible.\n\nFor the first part of the talk, I would like to cover understanding the complex landscape of users, and the tools that Apple provide developers to enable these users to use their devices. This would include a few short demos of different aspects of accessibility features available on iOS - mostly VoiceOver and Switch Control.\n\nThe second part of the talk would focus on ways of improving accessibility UX and how to quickly and effectively implement it in mobile apps. The talk would be helpful for any mobile app developers regardless of platform, but the code examples and demos would be given on iOS.\n\nSally Shepard is an iOS developer, accessibility consultant and hardware hacker who has worked on a wide variety of award winning apps. She previously worked at Dennis Publishing as Head of App Development, working on some of the top Newsstand apps. Before the iPhone, she studied audio engineering, a field which combined her love of music and tinkering with expensive hardware.\n\nFor more on YOW!
