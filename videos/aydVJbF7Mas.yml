description: "In my humble opinion Spock is a better tool for unit testing than JUnit. The presentation will give several examples to support this opinion. It will show you the areas where Spock shines.\n\nTo be honest there are also things that JUnit does better, so there will be time for that as well.\n\nFinally I will show (with a little live coding) how simple and effortless one can start testing with Spock. At the end of this session everybody should be able to write their own Spock tests and more importantly everybody will be eager to try it!\n\nBouke Nijhuis is a managing consultant at CINQ ICT. Currently he works for the Rabobank where he uses technologies like Spring Boot, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Jenkins & Pega. He is busy with the integration of new technologies into the technological stack of the teams.
