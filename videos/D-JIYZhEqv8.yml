recordingDate: 1521986685
description: "ES has introduced some great features like async-await, generators and iterators, but even more exciting stuff happens when you mix them together. With the new async-iteration feature, you can do just that. In this talk, Yael showcases the capabilities of async iterators and how they make our code cleaner and our life easier.\n\nYael Hermon is a true nerd, Yael started developing as a child with IRC scripting. She then became a .NET developer, but eventually joined the cool kids as a hip JavaScript developer that loves talking about the latest and greatest new features of the language. Yael is now a front-end developer at Wix."
