title: 'Mentoring Junior Developers Into Productive Team Members - Daniel Mallott'
recordingDate: 1539853684
description: "How do we make sure the Junior Developers on our teams contribute positively? How do we guide them into becoming the best developers they can be? Managing people can be hard, but I'll outline strategies to help mentor new developers while teaching them to be independent, positive contributors in any circumstance. Along the way, we'll talk about learning styles, the need to be open to any questions and how and when to explain versus when to simply say \"you'll have to trust me for now.\"\nThese skills can be applicable in any project style or language, but we'll use Agile methodology and .NET languages for real life project examples. \n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
