title: '[VDT18] A Practical Introduction to Convnets for Image Classification by Alessandro Giusti'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540659213
description: "An introduction to developing a complete pipeline based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to solve supervised image classification tasks. We consider the task of classifying hand gestures from images as rock, paper or scissors, and present the whole pipeline discussing pratical issues such as dataset acquisition, splitting training/testing data, CNN architectures, training and evaluating models. The journey will encounter a few setbacks, which introduces important machine learning concepts such as overfitting, generalization ability, dataset augmentation strategies. The talk is concluded by discussing a few spectacular applications of similar techniques in various fields (robotics, industry, biomedicine).\n\nThe talk is delivered through slides and a Python Jupyter notebook, using keras and tensorflow as a backend. The main messages, however, are conceptual and language-independent. The talk has no prerequisites."
