description: "Deep Dive: Kubernetes IoT Edge WG – Cindy Xing, Huawei, Dejan Bosanac, Red Hat, Preston Holmes, Google, & Steve Wong, VMware \n\nWhat are the workloads that are unique or common to running Kubernetes on the edge? How do they take advantage of existing Kubernetes features, or require refinements and new capabilities? We’ll dive into the use cases, functional requirements and unique challenges of deploying IoT and Edge workloads on Kubernetes and discuss the technical challenges involved today. With the goal of addressing the challenges, we’ll have a panel discussion to share views and ideas on potential platform improvements. The session will close with audience participation and Q&A. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/HSCE"
