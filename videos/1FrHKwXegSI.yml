Once the basics are in place, users would have questions regarding day-2 operations like the following: - Networking: Which CNI network driver I should use?  Stateful v/s Stateless apps: How to run a stateful workload? - Application Packaging: How to package my application? - Security: What are some of the security guidelines? - Debugging: How to debug, if an application, node or cluster fails? - Deployment Pipelines: What are my options to do CI/CD, and how to build a pipeline? - Devops concerns: How to set-up logging, monitoring, observability? In this session, I'll answer the above questions. \n\nhttps://sched.co/YVxx"
