description: "Asif Khan talks about how to connect the workflow between the data scientists and DevOps. He explores basic continuous integration and delivery concepts and how they can be applied to deep learning models. Using a number of AWS services, he showcases how we can take the output of a deep learning model and deploy it to perform predictions in real time with low latency and high availability. In particular, he showcases the ease of deploying DL predict functions using Apache MXNet (a deep learning library), Amazon ECS, Amazon S3, and Amazon ECR, Amazon developer tools, and AWS CloudFormation.\n\nAsif Khan is a Tech leader with Amazon Web Services. \n\nThis video was recorded at QCon.ai 2018: https://bit.ly/2piRtLl \n\nThe next QCon is in New York, June 25-29, 2018.
