title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Demystifying Rendered Content in Drupal 8 Twig Files'
recordingDate: 1493758877
description: "New\_to\_Twig? It's\_a robust and elegant template engine for PHP. Once I started working with Twig, I instantly fell in love with\_it\_and here's why:\_it's lightweight, fairly quick to pick up, and very readable. Not only that, but I feel like I have\_ultimate control over\_the markup, including wrapping elements and rendering exactly the output I need. Theming Drupal has never been more dreamy!\_\_\n\nIf you are new to\_front-end development in Drupal\_or\_a veteran, AND\_you\_are\_ready to take your project’s\_markup powerfully\_into your own hands then\_this talk is for you.\_\n\nDuring this session, I will take you through a brief intro into twig, the debugging process of sorting through twig variables using xdebug in PHPStorm, mention other helpful debugging tools at our disposal, and share common patterns I found helpful\_for rendering content in twig files.\_\n\nIf time allows, I also hope to\_demonstrate how to use Display Suite, taking\_your\_Twig files to exciting new heights."
