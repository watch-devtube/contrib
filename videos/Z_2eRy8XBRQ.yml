description: "Hello to the World in 8 Web Frameworks (micro, batteries included & async)\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - Lammermuir]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Aaron Bassett\n\nJoin us for a Phileas Fogg inspired whirlwind tour of eight Python web frameworks.\n\n\"Had he programmed? It was likely, for no one seemed to know web frameworks more familiarly; there was no framework so obscure that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it. He must have developed in everything, at least in the spirit.\"\n\nWe'll start with the current crop of microframeworks, showing how to achieve the same task in each, before progressing to \"Batteries included\" and the more specialised async frameworks.\n\nFor developers who perhaps have only used a single framework, this talk gives them an opportunity to get out and explore the world (of web frameworks) and broaden their horizons, with plenty of Jules Verne inspired fun along the way.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
