description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nWe all know that Erlang is great for building complicated distributed systems, but did you know that building a website in Erlang is as easy as using Ruby on Rails? In this talk I'll introduce you to Chicago Boss, the web framework that takes care of all the hard parts of Erlang/OTP for you, letting the developer focus on building a great website. I'll explain why Erlang is an excellent choice for delivering web content, give a high-level overview of the Chicago Boss architecture, and explicate the philosophy behind some of CB's controversial design decisions. In the process we'll cover CB's high-performance template system, its custom compiler chain and language-integrated query syntax, its unique approaches to e-mail and i18n, and everything in between. Some practical code examples will be included at the end. All levels of expertise are welcome."
