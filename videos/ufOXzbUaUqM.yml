description: 'Interested in learning how to use the Google Maps API and WebGL to create a dynamic terrain lighting map of the surface of Mars? Or how about using the Street View API and a bit of ImageMagick to view the high resolution panoramic images from the Curiosity Rover? Since Curiosity''s touchdown, Brendan Kenny and Paul Saxman have been infected with a bit of Mars Mania.
