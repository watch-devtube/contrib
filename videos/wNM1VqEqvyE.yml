description: "Alistair Francis\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/206/\n\nA talk about the RISC-V 32-bit glibc port. This will include details about the 64-bit time_t problem and how RV32 is going to be the first 32-bit architecture with a 64-bit time_t. This talk will also discuss what the current progress of upstreaming is, what is left to be done and why it has taken so long.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
