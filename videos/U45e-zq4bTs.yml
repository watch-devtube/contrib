Scoped styles and variables are vital to the reusability of content modules which Web Components bring, while more advanced proposals even allow the application of markup through style... This talk will introduce the core features of the future web - templates, custom elements and Shadow DOM - with a strong emphasis on new and repurposed CSS properties and capabilities.\"\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
