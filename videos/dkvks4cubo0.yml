description: "Google Tech Talk\nNovember 30, 2012\n\nPresented by Kjersti Chippindale and Violet Replicon from the FIRST Team Antipodes\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAntipodes, a Bay-Area all-girl robotics team, will speak about their experiences designing, building and driving robots in FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) and how it's transformed their middle and high school experiences.  This year their presentation will include an overview of their robot design process, which they have documented and now share with their fellow competitors.  After their presentation, the girls will have 3 years of championship robots on display, answer any questions you might have, and let you try your hand at manning the controls.\n\nThis is Team Antipodes' third Google Tech Talk.  Instead of entering the competition this year, they are devoting their time to scale their impact by teaching and mentoring new competitors and recruiting new adult mentors to the program.  If you have ever been interested in participating in the FIRST Robotics program, please consider attending this presentation.\n\nhttp://www.theonerobot.com/\nhttp://www.usfirst.org/"
