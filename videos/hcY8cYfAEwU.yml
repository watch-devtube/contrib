description: "In my technical presentation (\"The Evolution of Java: Past, Present, and Future\"), I'll be discussing all of the changes to the Java programming language since its inception. In this this keynote, I'll focus my attention on the starting point: I'll present my candidates for the best and worst features in the platform as it was originally released (JDK 1.0), and explain the reasoning behind my choices. Some of my choices may be obvious, but others will likely surprise you. A splendid time is guaranteed for all.\n\nJosh Bloch\n\nGoogle\n\nJoshua Bloch is a software architect in the Open Source Program Office at Google, author of the bestselling, Jolt Award-winning \"Effective Java\" (Addison-Wesley, 2001; Second Edition, 2008), and coauthor of \"Java Puzzlers: Traps, Pitfalls, and Corner Cases\" (Addison-Wesley, 2005) and \"Java Conurrency in Practice\" (Addison-Wesley, 2006).
