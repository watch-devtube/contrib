description: "Held on April 24 2018\n\nTo use property graphs, first, you’ll need a graph model. For a new user, modeling and generating a suitable graph for an application domain can be a challenge. In April’s session, Albert described key steps required to model a graph, using an HR example.  Then Zhe showed how to construct a meaningful graph using ODI, Java/SQL APIs, or various utilities supporting various data sources (Database or other file formats).\n\nNOTE:  If you missed February’s session, please watch the recording prior to this session: \nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=100:551:::NO:551:P551_CLASS_ID:3401&cs=11ED98BAEBB81DD95ADED292AE0744349\n\nHighlights:\n00:00 - Speaker intros\n01:40 - Graph Architecture Overview\n04:52 - Designing Graphs:  what is a graph model, comparison with relational, considerations on moving from a relational to a graph model, some graph modeling examples (HR and customer orders)\n24:56 - Constructing Graphs – overview of available options\n26:34 - Constructing Graphs using Oracle Data Integrator (demo starts at 29:55)\n39:50 - Using DAL APIs to programmatically create a graph\n41:00 - Read from a data source and use DAL APIs to programmatically create a graph\n42:20 - Generate a Property Graph (.opv/.ope) directly from relational tables (views) \n44:10 - Generate a Property Graph (.opv/.ope) directly from CSV Files\n44:50 - Construct a property graph with SQL\n47:05 - Resources and wrapup\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/\nhttps://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit\n\n\nmusic: bensound.com"
