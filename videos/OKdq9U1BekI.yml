description: "Stratos Project Update: Kubernetes and More - Neil MacDougall & Richard Cox, SUSE\n\nIn this talk we will give an update on the Stratos project and demonstrate some of the new functionality that the team has added recently and we'll talk about the roadmap ahead. We will introduce and show the new Kubernetes and Helm functionality that we are upstreaming into Stratos and talk about the new documentation website that we are building out. If you don't know what Stratos is, or you want to hear what the team has been up to, this is the talk for you."
