description: 'Codemotion Milan 2015 - "Alert overload: How to adopt a microservices architecture without being overwhelmed with noise" by Sarah Wells - You''ve heard all about what microservices can do for you. You''re convinced. So you build some. Reasoning about your functionality is way easier: these services are so simple! Then you get to the point where you have 35 microservices, in three data centres, and all the monitoring and alerting tactics you used for your monoliths are a complete disaster. You can''t pick out the important stuff and your inbox is unusable. Something needs to change, and this talk will explain what and how.'
