description: "The practice of software engineering outputs lots of data, which is often used by nontechnical people to measure the productivity of a team and the health of a project.  Teams know how they are doing, but someone has to measure and report that up the chain of the command in a succinct way. Instead of having a guy with a clipboard trying to interpret relative data, engineers need to take over the ownership of metrics and measurement and distill the right data for the right levels of visibility. This session covers the types of data that engineering teams can distill, how to break it down, and how to report it in a way in which these metrics become a byproduct of the team’s work.\n\n\nAuthor:\nChristopher W H Davis\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Christopher W H Davis at https://www.parleys.com/author/christopher-w-h-davis-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
