description: 'Ok, let’s get real: VR in a Web Browser isn’t something new in 2017. Firefox shipped their support for everyone. HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and other hardware is being supported. You can create VR experiences using your browser and Javascript. New browser engines are powerful enough to be able to serve the experiences on a open and standardized platform. But what about AR? Or Mixed Realities (MR)? Join my session and learn how AR or better said MR is getting into your browsers, too. See how and what the platform is being able to offer and what you could expect in near future.'
