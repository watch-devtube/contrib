description: "Topic: Reducing Technology Risks through Prototyping\nHow to deliver a successful product when technology landscape is new and rapidly changing? How to identify technology limitations before moving to production? What if there are no technology experts to answer your questions?\n\nStrategic prototyping can help development teams respond to these issues instead of blindly building full-scale products. I will not be offering silver bullets of simple recipes for success. Instead, you will learn about the practical guidelines for prototyping, combining architecture analysis and a variety of prototyping techniques. With some Big Data systems development flavor on top of it.\n\nAbout Valdas:\nIT Solutions Architect and Team Lead working at Cognizant, where he leads a Big Data team and enables a paradigm shift in how financial companies use data.\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/valdasm/\nBlog: http://blog.thevaldas.com"
