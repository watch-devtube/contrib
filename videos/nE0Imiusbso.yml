title: 'YOW! Nights November 2016 Lindsay Holmwood - Breaking the Cylinders of Excellence'
recordingDate: 1480028996
description: "Nobody interacts with government because they want to - they interact with government because they have to, and most people come away from online interactions feeling more confused than when they started.\n\nThat's why the Digital Transformation Office (now the Digital Transformation Agency) was created in 2015 – to change the way government delivers services, by relentlessly focusing all delivery activities on user needs, and modernising technical delivery methods.\n\nIn this talk we'll learn about the problems with the traditional approach to digital service delivery in government, the cultural and structural barriers to changing service delivery in government, and how Open Source platforms, APIs, and Continuous Delivery enable the DTA to help government deliver simpler, clearer, faster public services.\n\nLindsay Holmwood is a engineering manager living in the Australian Blue Mountains. Lindsay works at the Australian Government’s Digital Transformation Office, building clearer, simpler, faster, more humane public services . A long-time contributor to the open source and DevOps communities, he authored cucumber-nagios, Visage, and Flapjack, and has run the Sydney DevOps meetup the past five years.\n\nLindsay speaks internationally about both the cultural and technical side of DevOps, covering Just Culture, complexity, cognitive biases, and monitoring tools. He also won third place at the 1996 Sydney Royal Easter Show LEGO building competition. You can find Lindsay on Twitter @auxesis, and read his blog at http://fractio.nl.\n\nFor more on YOW!
