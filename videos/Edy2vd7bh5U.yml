description: "Intro + Deep Dive: Jaeger - Juraci Paixão Kröhling, Red Hat & Prithvi Raj, Uber \n\nJaeger is a distributed tracing platform, providing a way to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems. In the first part, we’ll introduce you to Jaeger, showing what it is capable of. We’ll deploy a few microservices into a Kubernetes cluster and use distributed tracing to help us see what’s going on. After this brief demo, you’ll learn how to engage with the community and how to make your first contribution to the project. In the second part of this talk, we’ll explain in details what are all the moving pieces and how they work together. You’ll also learn about the different deployment strategies and advanced configuration options. And finally, we’ll have a Q&A session at the end with project maintainers. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPkv"
