description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeakers: Gary Russell\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-for-apache-kafka\n\nWith the advent of the Kafka 0.9+ pure Java client, the Spring Team has created the new spring-kafka project with familiar Spring abstractions such as the KafkaTemplate, message listener container and POJO listener annotation @KafkaListener.\n\nIn this talk we'll take a look at the features of the project as well as the new version (2.0) of spring-integration-kafka which is now based on the Spring for Apache Kafka project."
