description: "From the 2014 Strata Conference + Hadoop World in New York City.\n\nWe are being watched – by companies, by the government, by our neighbors. Technology has made powerful surveillance tools available to everyone. And now some of us are investing in counter-surveillance techniques and tactics. Julia Angwin discusses how much she has spent trying to protect her privacy, and raises the question of whether we want to live in a society where only the rich can buy their way out of ubiquitous surveillance.\n\nAbout Julia Angwin:\nJulia Angwin is an award-winning investigative journalist at the independent news organization ProPublica.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2013, she was a reporter at The Wall Street Journal, where she led a privacy investigative team that was a Finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in Explanatory Reporting in 2011 and won a Gerald Loeb Award in 2010. Her book, Dragnet Nation: A Quest for Privacy, Security and Freedom in a World of Relentless Surveillance, was published by Times Books in 2014.\n\nIn 2003, she was on a team of reporters at The Wall Street Journal that was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Explanatory Reporting for coverage of corporate corruption. She is also the author of “Stealing MySpace: The Battle to Control the Most Popular Website in America” (Random House, March 2009).\n\nShe earned a B.A. in mathematics from the University of Chicago, and an MBA from the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop World 2014: http://goo.gl/UUfrR7\nFind out more about the conference: http://strataconf.com/stratany2014\n\nDon't miss an upload!
