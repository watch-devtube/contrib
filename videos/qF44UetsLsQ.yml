description: "Further information: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/17/session/why-are-we-using-json\n\nWhen I setup my iPhone to use HTTP proxy and pick on the traffic, I see lot's of JSON going cross the wire. In fact most of the traffic I intercept is encoded as JSON. I should not be surprised, JSON became a standard for data serialisation. But is it a good standard? In my talk I want to challenge your perception of JSON and outline the penalties we willing to accept while using JSON.\n\nSpeaker:\nMaxim Zaks"
