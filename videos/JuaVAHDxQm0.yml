title: 'CrowdInside: Automatic Construction of Indoor Floorplans'
recordingDate: 1353536520
description: "Google Tech Talk\nNovember 12, 2012\n\nPresented by Moustafa Youssef.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe existence of a worldwide indoor floorplans database can lead to significant growth in location-based applications, especially for indoor environments. In this paper, we present CrowdInside: a crowd sourcing-based system for the automatic construction of buildings floorplans. CrowdInside leverages the smart phones sensors that are ubiquitously available with humans who use a building to automatically and transparently construct accurate motion traces. These accurate traces are generated based on a novel technique for reducing the errors in the inertial motion traces by using the points of interest in the indoor environment, such as elevators and stairs, for error resetting. The collected traces are then processed to detect the overall floorplan shape as well as higher level semantics such as detecting rooms and corridors shapes along with a variety of points of interest in the environment.\nImplementation of the system in two testbeds, using different Android phones, shows that CrowdInside can detect the points of interest accurately with 0.2% false positive rate and 1.3% false negative rate. In addition, the proposed error resetting technique leads to more than 12 times enhancement in the median distance error compared to the state-of-the-art.\nMoreover, the detailed floorplan can be accurately estimated with a relatively small number of traces. This number is amortized over the number of users of the building. We also discuss possible extensions to CrowdInside for inferring even higher level semantics about the discovered floorplans."
