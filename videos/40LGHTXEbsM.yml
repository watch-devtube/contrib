description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2012\n\nwww.erlang-solutions.com\nwww.erlang-factory.com\n\n\"The Swedish payment solution provider Klarna has grown from three founders to over 600 employees in seven years. The customer base has grown from zero to 14.000 connected e-stores and almost ten million end users.\n\nTo grow at this rate, currently one new employee every second day, brings tremendous demands on scalability. \nObviously the technical solution has to scale with the increased user load, but the process and the people in the organisation need to scale as well.\n\nThis talk will draw on the experiences from Klarna's journey so far with a focus on scaling people and processes, but it will also touch on some technical challenges and choices.\nErik will share some anecdotes from a business in rapid growth and sprinkle the presentation with tips of dos and don'ts when scaling your development and operation.\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory \_https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\_\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory \_http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
