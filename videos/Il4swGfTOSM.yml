description: "Ilya Grigorik is extremely passionate about a web that works fast. Lucky for you, he works for Google's Make The Web Fast team, spending his days doing exactly that and as an advocate for performance best practices. \n\nHe stopped by SFHTML5 to outline the logistics behind building a mobile website that loads as quickly as possible. A site that not only renders in 1 second, but one that is also visible in 1 second. With hard statistics as evidence to show why this matters, Ilya discusses techniques to deliver a 1000 millisecond experience.\n\n**For more tips, tricks, and techniques on HTML5, check out the tons of video content on our site: https://marakana.com/s/tags/html5"
