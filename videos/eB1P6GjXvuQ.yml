description: "Check out the latest from The Lead Developer at theleaddeveloper.com.\n\nDeploying website code might seem like dark magic to anyone not well versed in the specific tools and commands that go into orchestrating such complex systems, and crippling fear of breaking the website can be a real thing. However, it's possible to make the deployment process clear, easy and, dare I say, enjoyable for all involved!\n\nInitially developed by a small team within Behance, and eventually growing into its own team and product, we've developed a continuous integration and deployment platform that places an emphasis on both deployment integrity and user (in this case, engineers deploying their code) happiness.\n\nThis talk will cover how we designed a process that empowers every engineer to manage their deploy from start to finish, from day 1, safely, effectively and quickly, and how our team structure and company culture allow us to quickly identify and iterate on improvements to the platform itself."
