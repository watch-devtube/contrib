description: '"I think we''re going to have to go with React...", was the concluding statement of a long day, preceded by two weeks of contention. I didn''t choose React because I liked it from a technical perspective, I chose it because it was the right fit for the people in our team. However, after scrapping a three-quarter written web application and rewriting it in React, initial disdain has turned into appreciation; somewhat facilitated by the excellent Redux state library. In this talk we''ll discuss why React makes sense for organizations, how to get the most out of it through following certain paradigm.'
