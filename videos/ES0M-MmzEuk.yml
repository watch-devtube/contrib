language: English
recordingDate: 1522191602
description: "Some time ago the font world was super-excited by the announcement (by Google, Microsoft, Adobe and Apple) of the OpenType 1.8 Variable Font format. Development versions of Safari soon supported Variable Fonts via the ‘font-variation-settings’ CSS property. Chrome since added support on all platforms. Yet the technology’s success depends on being embraced by typography’s new vanguard: UX designers and front-end developers.\n\nLaurence explains the manifold benefits for the web: responsive type within responsive design, reduced webfont payload, and much more. He shows how to explore the possibilities of Variable Fonts using his Axis-Praxis website and other tools, encourages dialogue with font makers to make sure they’re making the responsive fonts you need, and explains how to deploy Variable Fonts in real projects.\n\nEVENT:\n\ndotCSS 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nLaurence Penney\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\ndotConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nTalk details: https://www.dotconferences.com/2017/11/laurence-penney-variable-fonts\n\ndotConference YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSRhwaM00ay0fasnsw6EXKA"
