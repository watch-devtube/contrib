description: "RubyConf 2018 - JRuby 2018: Real World Performance by Thomas Enebo & Charles Nutter\n\n This year has been big for JRuby! We're pushing the edges of performance on the JVM and now see large frameworks running much faster than CRuby. This talk will cover the optimizations we've done in 2018 and what impact they're having on performance. We'll go through several features that did not optimize well before the recent work. We'll talk about supporting new Rails versions and how we're working to make Rails apps more reliable, more concurrent, and more scalable. Finally we will discuss what the future holds and how you can get involved."
