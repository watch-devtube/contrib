description: "Creating a Google Data API Client\r\nJeff Scudder (Google)\r\n\r\nWhat if there isn't a client library for the Google Data APIs in the language I'm using? Or maybe there is but it doesn't quite meet my needs. I'll address these important questions by examining the approach that I've taken in working on one of our open source client libraries (Python). Learn some ideas for how to structure your projects from a technical perspective and why and how to open source your project so others can contribute.\r\n\r\nParticipants should have strong knowledge of Google Data APIs and be familiar with open source project management."
