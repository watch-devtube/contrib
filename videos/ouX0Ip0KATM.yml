description: "Dale will be talking about how CouchDB and Membase compliment each other and how Couchbase are working on integrating the 2 products to bring you Couchbase. Couchbase aims to be a simple, fast and elastic data store that builds upon and integrates the trusted components Membase and Apache CouchDB. Membase is a protocol compatible clustering and persistence solution on top of the ubiquitous memcached. The presentation is not going to be a product pitch but chock full of details how all the components work nicely together and how the combination solves user-problems head on.\n\nMore Info: http://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/couchdb-membase-couchbase\n\nDescription of Dale Harvey:\nhttp://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/dale-harvey"
