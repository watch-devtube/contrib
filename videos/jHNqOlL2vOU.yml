description: "You have the power to change your life with actionable insights from your own data. As Alan Turing famously said - \"Sometimes it's the very people who no one imagines anything of that do the things that no one can imagine\".\n\nIn this session I want to share a personal story of how I have grown to understand my own data and share examples of how the data of you may be one of the first big data sets that you can master to have the most profound impact on the way that you form habits and gain insight into your personal health. I will demonstrate Cortana Analytics Suite and introduce Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and show how I have used it to detect and be notified of the early warning signs of getting a virus. I will demonstrate Microsoft’s globally distributed, multi-model database service Cosmos DB and show how you can use it along with LUIS.ai to create a cross platform bot that supports natural language interfaces and provides insight to your behaviours. You can use the service to look for correlations in your data and leverage tools like Power BI to visualize your data. You’ll be inspired and full of ideas on what you could do with your own personal health data and be buzzing with ideas on how you can use your own digital personal assistant to ask questions of your data."
