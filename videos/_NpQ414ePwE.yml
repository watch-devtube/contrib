description: "This Video was recorded at the Erlang Factory Lite in Munich. Info and slides available here: https://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/Munich2013\n\nWhile Erlang is a powerful programming language used to build distributed, fault tolerant systems with requirements of high availability, these complex systems require middleware in the form of reusable libraries, release, debugging and maintenance tools together with design principles and patterns used to style your concurrency model and your architecture.\n\nIn this talk, Francesco introduces the building blocks that form OTP, the defacto middleware that ships with the Erlang/OTP distribution. He will cover OTP's design principles, describing how they provide software engineering guidelines that enable developers to structure systems in a scalable and fault tolerant way, without the need to reinvent the wheel.\n\nTalk objectives: Introduce a powerful framework which reduces errors and helps developers achieve robustness and fault tollerance without affecting time to market.\n\nTarget audience:  Erlang beginners and engineers and architects implementing scalable, server side systems."
