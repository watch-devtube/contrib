description: "Speaker: Nayan Hajratwala (@nhajratw), Lean / Agile Coach @ Chikli Consulting\n\nAre you frustrated by the many trivial examples that show up when you google \"refactor legacy code\"? How do you translate these examples to your real-world code base? Sometimes it's just easier to give up on the refactoring and increased test coverage, reserving these techniques for the ever elusive greenfield project. To help you with this dilemma, Nayan will walk through a real legacy Java code base, and perform some safe refactorings required to bring the code under test. All of this will be done under the guidance of the Four Rules of Simple Design (Pass the tests, DRY, Reveal intent, Minimize moving parts).\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nNayan Hajratwala is the owner of Chikli Consulting. A Lean/Agile Coach with over 15 years of hands-on experience delivering software, he has significant programming experience and is a deep technologist always exploring new languages and ideas. His specialties include training software teams to increase their productivity and decrease their time-to-market while improving the quality of their product.\n\nNayan has been involved in the organizing committees for the Agile 2009-2016 conferences and is a speaker at many user groups and conferences in the Midwest. He is also on the Board of Directors for Southeast Michigan's Agile & Beyond conference.\n\nNayan is one of the founders of CodeRetreat, designed to increase the skill level of developers through techniques such as Test Driven Development, Pair Programming, and Simple Design.\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.agilesingapore.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/XvBh/"
