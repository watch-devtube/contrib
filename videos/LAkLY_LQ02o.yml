description: "Defining Mutli-Tenant Access Controls for a Cluster - Anund McKague, Atlassian \n\nWhat we've learned while building an internal PaaS allowing automated self service access to our multi-tenant clusters. Teams have access to create service based namespaces on demand. Beginning with how users authenicate via our open source cli tool connecting ldap and 2fa, continuing through our use of authentication webhooks, on to our use of authorization webhooks and RBAC, and finishing with how we manage creation of dynamic RBAC based roles.  Talk will touch on authentication webhooks, github.com/atlassian/kubetoken, mutating and validating webhooks, api servers as proxies to internal services, managing rbac roles and dynamic creation of role bindings, along with some of the security implications of cluster roles and cluster role bindings. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrUF"
