title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2012: Karel Minarik & Lukas Vlcek - Three Nodes and One Cluster'
recordingDate: 1545060606
description: "One of the most alluring features of ElasticSearch [http://www.elasticsearch.org/] are the distributed features: it makes it trivial to scale by adding nodes to the cluster. But how does all that work? In our talk, we would like to perform a live on-screen demo of operating a small ElasticSearch cluster of three nodes. Each of the nodes will be manned by one speaker, and we would like to present: * how adding and removing nodes together with configuring index shards and replicas affects a running cluster, * what the cluster health states, “green”, “yellow” and “red” mean, * when the rebalancing of the cluster happens and how it works, * how the cluster operates in the “red” state, * how the shards and replicas settings affect cluster performance, * describe different possible network topologies of ElasticSearch. After the talk, ElasticSearch novices should be able to understand what precisely goes on when they add a node to ElasticSearch cluster, and intermediate or advanced users should take joy in seeing familiar concepts appearing on screen, in a clear, unambiguous manner. The three speakers will be: Shay Banon [http://twitter.com/kimchy] is the author of ElasticSearch. Karel Minařík [http://twitter.com/karmiq] is the author of the Ruby library for ElasticSearch, Tire, and is spreading the word on ElasticSearch through the Ruby community. Lukáš Vlček [http://twitter.com/lukasvlcek] is the author of the BigDesk monitoring utility for ElasticSearch and has been using ElasticSearch since its early releases for the upcoming JBoss.org community search.\n\nMore Info: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/three-nodes-and-one-cluster-demo-elasticsearchs-distributed-features\n\nDescription of Karel Minarik: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/karel-minarik"
