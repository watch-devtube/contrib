title: 'YOW! 2017 Kasper Lund - Flutter: The Best Way to Build for Mobile?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1522187870
description: "Want a more productive way to build for mobile? Flutter is an SDK for building high-performance, high-fidelity, apps for iOS and Android, from a single code-base. Flutter delivers a great developer experience in part because it is based on Dart, which allows you to build your cross-platform mobile apps in an approachable and analyzable language with sub-second edit-and-continue support baked in.\nCome see what makes Flutter special and learn how you can become a more productive mobile developer.\n\nKasper Lund is a software engineer at Google working on the design and implementation of programming languages. He currently leads the Dart platform engineering efforts in Aarhus and back in 2006, he co-founded the V8 project and brought it to the market a few years later -- dramatically speeding up JavaScript execution for everyone in the process. Kasper has more than 15 years of industrial experience in designing and implementing virtual machines and runtime systems and his primary areas of interests and expertise are efficient interpretation, dynamic compilation, and adaptive optimizations.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
