Having this capability available both during the development and throughout the whole lifetime of an application is one of the great advantages of using Erlang/OTP. We believe that there is lots of room for improving the current set of desktop and web based tools building on this capability. In doing so we hope to make life easier for developers who're just getting started with Erlang as well as more experienced developers looking to improve their understanding of an application.\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \nIn this talk we want to present a data collection application building on the tracing and error reporting capabilities in the erlang runtime system as well as the open source library folsom by Joe Williams. We also want to present a web application for controlling and presenting the data collected from one or more running Erlang nodes.\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory \_https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\_\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory \_http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
