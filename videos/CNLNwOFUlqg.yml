description: "This session is a deep dive into the modern best practices around asynchronous decoupling, resilience, and scalability that allow us to implement a large-scale software system from the building blocks of events and services, based on the speaker's experiences implementing such systems at Google, eBay, and other high-performing technology organizations.\n\nWe will outline the various options for handling event delivery and event ordering in a distributed system. We will cover data and persistence in an event-driven architecture. Finally, we will describe how to combine events, services, and so-called \"serverless\" functions into a powerful overall architecture.\n\nYou will leave with practical suggestions to help you accelerate your development velocity and drive business results.\n\nEVENT:\n\nBuild Stuff 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRandy Shoup\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nBuild Stuff Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to re publish this video."
