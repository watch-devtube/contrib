description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAre You Sure About Your Mesh Performance? Details matter! - Otto van der Schaaf, Red Hat, Sunku Ranganath & Mrittika Ganguli, Intel Corporation\n\nService Mesh performance characterization has been an elusive aspect of understanding the impact of mesh in production. While few studies have been published, mesh performance generally is highly influenced by runtime environment, hardware settings, test tool & methodology used to benchmark. Based on various tests performed on Envoy, this presentation aims to shed light on: -Performance characterization methodology of Envoy for deterministic throughput & latency -Gaps in benchmark tools - disconnect between L2 to L7 optimizations for load generation & features WIP to address these gaps, e.g. with Nighthawk -Common pitfalls in measurements -Usual culprits for lack of consistency in benchmarks -Impact of scaling Envoy on latency & hardware utilization -Share benchmark results & common bottlenecks using Envoy sandboxes -Customizing Envoy for telco grade performance with hardware offloads"
