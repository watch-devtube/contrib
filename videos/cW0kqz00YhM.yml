language: German
recordingDate: 1504537687
description: 'Did you ever found hs_err_pid or replay_pid files in your Java application directory? Did your Java application ever crash and you didn’t know why? This talk will unveil the contents stored by the HotSpot crash handler into the corresponding error files and how this information can be used to analyze and reproduce the crash. It will also introduce tools like the HotSpot Serviceability Agent which helps to introspect native core files and extract the relevant Java information from them which is otherwise not easily accessible by native debuggers.'
