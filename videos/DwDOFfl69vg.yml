description: "Martin Thompson\nHigh-Performance & Low-Latency Computing Specialist\nReal Logic\n\nCommon wisdom dictates that native languages are the only means of building high-performance applications. How do managed runtimes such as those available to Java, .NET, and even JavaScript compare? Many applications requiring high-performance are now developed for managed runtimes - such as financial trading, data stores and analytics, messaging, and even supercomputing. Over the last few decades we have seen significant advances in managed runtimes, particularly for JIT compilers and garbage collectors. In this talk we will explore how our managed runtimes can equal, and even better in some cases, the performance of native languages."
