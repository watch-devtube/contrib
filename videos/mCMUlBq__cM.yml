title: 'Garbage Collection: The Useful Parts (Practical), Part 2'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784670
description: "This presentation gives busy Java/JVM developers an overview of how to analyze and resolve common garbage collection problems. Using popular applications such as Minecraft, it shows you how to solve problems such as OutOfMemoryErrors, long pause times, premature promotion, and more. Overall, it covers how developers should set their GC performance goals, how to get information out of a production GC log, and some pitfalls of setting certain GC flags. For each problem, it shows developers how to interpret the data and then how to tune the GC to meet the stated GC performance goal. This will give developers the practical understanding for them to empirically solve GC problems, as opposed to guessing.\n\n\nAuthors:\nMartijn Verburg\nMartijn Verburg (aka 'the Diabolical Developer') herds Cats in the Java/open source communities and is constantly humbled by the creative power to be found there. Currently he resides in London where he co-leads the London JUG (a JCP EC member), runs a couple of open source projects & drinks too much beer at his local pub. You can find him online moderating at the Javaranch or discussing (ranting?) subjects on the Programmers Stack Exchange site. Most recently he's become a regular speaker at conferences on Java, open source and software development and has recently wrapped up his first Manning title - \"The Well-Grounded Java Developer\" with his co-author Ben Evans.\nView more trainings by Martijn Verburg at https://www.parleys.com/author/martijn-verburg\n\nJohn Oliver\nJohn is a keen developer and Matlab guru.\n\nJohn has performed research and development in many languages for 15 years, on various platforms from micro controllers, robots, simulations, desktop applications and web services.\n\nHe has previously worked on static analysis tools and is particularly interested in reducing our reliance on the relatively blunt and time consuming tools such as unit testing. John also has a special ability to make our continuous deployment chain just work.\n\nHe delivers all sorts of interesting analysis on our raw data, and is interested in bringing signal processing and machine learning techniques to analysing performance problems...despite us endlessly needling him about his love for Matlab.\n\nJohn holds a PhD in Engineering from Warwick University working on algorithms for coordinating mobile robotic teams. During his study he performed extensive work on both physical and simulated robotic platforms.\nView more trainings by John Oliver at https://www.parleys.com/author/john-oliver\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
