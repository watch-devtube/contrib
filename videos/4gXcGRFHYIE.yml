description: "by Hans Verkuil\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.401/v4l2.webm\n\n\nIn the past year a lot of work has been put into improving the V4L2 subsystem. The main addition was the Request API, which is required for stateless hardware codecs, and will help improve complex camera pipelines. Codecs in general saw a lot of attention and our virtual drivers are now being used in test frameworks. So it is time to present an overview of the current state of V4L2 and what can be expected from it in the future. \n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 17:00:00+01"
