description: "The Top Things I’ve Learned Since The Phoenix Project Came Out by Gene Kim\n\nHoly cow, I learned so much since The Phoenix Project came out in 2013. In this talk, I will share my top learnings while co-authoring The DevOps Handbook with Jez Humble, Patrick Debois, and John Willis. I’ll talk about the latest findings from the State of DevOps Report, the true importance of deployment lead times, how DevOps truly transforms the lives of Dev and Ops, what I learned about Conway’s Law, and how DevOps is a subset of dynamic learning organizations, of which Toyota is the most famous. This project was one of the most fun and rewarding adventures of my life, and I want to share some of my biggest a-ha moments"
