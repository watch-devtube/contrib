title: 'Building a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes Cluster and running .NET Core - Alex Ellis & Scott Hanselman'
recordingDate: 1518781222
description: "Join Scott Hanselman and Alex Ellis as they discuss how you can create your own Raspberry Pi cluster that runs Kubernetes on the metal.\n\nThen, take it to the next level by running OpenFaas (an open source serverless solution) on top of it. We'll see why and how to move from IaaS, to PaaS, to Serverless, and beyond! Building a hobbyist cluster that sits on your desk might just make you a better cloud developer!"
