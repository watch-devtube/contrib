title: 'Artificial Irreverence: Improvised Theatre with Robots by Piotr Mirowski'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510225553
description: "Would you go to see a show where one of the actors is a robot? We are two researchers in AI, with a shared passion for drama and the performing arts, who have embarked on a journey to create just such a show and to build a robotic stage partner, in order to perform live improvised comedy alongside an artificial intelligence system. We have created Pyggy and A.L.Ex. (Artificial Language Experiment), the first two Artificial Improvisors, each with a unique composition and embodiment, whom we have used in over 30 shows, from dingy pubs to international theatre festivals. We have relied on state-of-the-art natural language processing and deep learning techniques and we have trained a conversational agent on dialogue from a hundred thousand movies, then endowed the chatbot with a robotic avatar. This presentation highlights research and development, successes and failures along the way. The aim of our show is to build bridges between the artistic, acting and AI/hacker communities, and to raise questions about the nature of spontaneity and communication. Can we model language by patterns? How can a statistical language model inform improvised theatre? How easily do we suspend disbelief?\n\nPiotr studied computer science at ENSEEIHT and obtained his Ph.D. in deep learning at New York University under the supervision of Prof. Yann LeCun. He has a decade-long experience of machine learning in industrial research labs, where he developed solutions for epileptic seizure prediction from EEG, robotic navigation and natural language processing. His passion for performing arts, as a drama student with a 17-year background in improvised theatre, drew him to co-create (with Kory Mathewson) HumanMachine, an artistic experiment fusing improv and AI, where Piotr’s alter-ego Albert shares the stage with a computer called A.L.Ex. Piotr's collaborator Kory is a PhD student at the University of Alberta and an award-winning improv comedian."
