description: "Rediff.com (Nasdaq: REDF) is one of the top Internet portals in India, providing online communication services to India and the global Indian community. With over 100 million registered users, Rediff.com is one of the largest Indian Internet portals and one of the top email providers worldwide. Rediffmail is the company's popular email service and has experienced steady growth ever since it was launched in 1998. By 2011, the request load generated by the application had begun to overwhelm the underlying storage system, causing frequent outages. Metadata updates in connection with inbox management turned out the be the primary culprit, generating over 75% of the storage system request volume. In late 2011, the Rediffmail engineering team re-architected the system on top of Hypertable, solving the inbox management problem and eliminating the associated outages. In this talk, Doug Judd, the CEO of Hypertable Inc., will present the new Rediffmail architecture and describe how it leverages Hypertable as a core component.\n\nMore info: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/rediffmail-how-hypertable-powers-one-worlds-largest-email-services\n\nDescription of Doug Judd: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/doug-judd"
