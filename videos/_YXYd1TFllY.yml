description: 'A few years ago it seemed that the semantic web was poised to take over the world by storm. The idea of agents that would perform queries for you doing digital errands seemed irresistible. But realizing it required changing the way sites were built. In the meantime the smartphone happened and with it came a multitude of cheap and abundant sensors. Now we can realize a poor man''s version of the semantic web where instead of complex ontologies we define meanings and we can based on these define actions that impact the physical world around us, i.e., agent like entities. I''ll go through examples where we''ll see this poor man''s semantic web in action and how we can further explore this idea.'
