description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nTesting distributed systems is hard. Testing is hard, but we've been given tools like EUnit and common_test to make it easier. Where is this toolkit for distributed systems? I'm not going to claim that I have all the answers or even that I have a framework you can use to solve your problem. What I do have is an idea and a solution to MY problem, which is \"\"How do we test Riak?\"\n\nCome with me on an adventure of design decisions, tradeoffs and deep dark corners of Erlang. We'll go from group leaders to lager and port commands to cookies. By journey's end you'll have an understand of how we're able to test riak, how you may be able to build off what we've done to test your distributed system, and hopefully ideas on how we might, together, make riak_test generic enough to be that distributed testing tool we've been looking for."
