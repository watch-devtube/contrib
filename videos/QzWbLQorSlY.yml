title: 'Google Drive SDK: New Undo feature for the Realtime API'
language: English
recordingDate: 1367348439
description: 'We recently introduced a new feature to undo and redo changes in collaborative files with the Realtime API. This useful new feature handles all of the complexity of undoing changes when collaborators are involved and can be implemented with just a few lines of code. This undo feature can undo any local change, so it is useful for all types of files (not just text documents!). Tune in to for a demo and to see just how you can implement it in your apps.'
