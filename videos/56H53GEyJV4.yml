description: "Have you had blood pressure and heart beat increase with the proximity of the annual performance review rituals? Do you get the chills just before your \"performance improvement plan\" meeting with your boss? Have you had a poor review because you were not able to perform how you boss wanted, but in reality you could not have done anything different?\n\nPerformance Reviews are based in completely wrong assumptions. Companies still think that Performance Reviews are great tools to provide feedback, to set goals and to improve the individuals. All this is pure nonsense and in reality Performance Reviews are a cancer for our companies and they need to be removed.\n\nCome to see my talk and you will understand how Performance Reviews are completely incompatible with Agile Mindset and I will explain what can be done using examples of companies from all over the world that successfully tackled this problem.\n\nP.S.: due to technical issues first minutes of video were missed."
