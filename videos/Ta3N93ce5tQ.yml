title: 'How one team built their first microservice - Jim Pelletier'
language: English
recordingDate: 1506326623
description: "Microservices are here. But you're still stuck in a monolith. This is one team's story of how we decided to stop contributing to a shared monolith and start building our own microservices.\n\nFrom why we chose dotnet core, AWS, Docker, Terraform and Dynamo to the business context that drove and enabled us to build a microservice, I'll talk about our choices and experiences. Most importantly I'll tell you what we would have done differently if we had our time again."
