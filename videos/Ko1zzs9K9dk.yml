recordingDate: 1472043485
description: "Starting from an innocent question - what happens when you type google.com into a browser? - we'll explore how complex our field of computing has become.\nIt'll be a ride through acronym soup and rarely seen debugging experiences, as we peel back layer upon layer of magic. You'll leave this talk with a reinvigorated passion for complexity and problem solving. Or, you'll want to rage quit and take up horticulture."
