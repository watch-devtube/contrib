With Hadoop, \nno data is too big. \n\nMapReduce is a software framework that allows developers to write programs that process massive amounts of unstructured data in parallel across a distributed \ncluster of processors or stand-alone computers\n\nThe Topics covered in the video are:\n\n1.What is Big data?\n2.Limitations of existing solutions. \n3.Solving the problem with hadoop\n4.Hadoop ecosystem\n5.Hadoop Core Components\n6.HDFS Architecture\n7.MapReduce Job Execution\n8.Where Map Reduce is Used\n9.Traditional and Map Reduce wy of Solving problem\n10.Anatomy of a Map Reduce\n11.Hadoop Streaming\n12.Combiner and Partitioner\n13.Map Reduce data Flow\n14.Input Splits\n15.Input/Output Formats\n\nRelated Blog Posts:\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/introduction-to-big-data-n-hadoop/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bigdata-hadoop-mapreduce\n\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/why-learn-hadoop/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bigdata-hadoop-mapreduce\n\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/big-data-applications-sears-case-study/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bigdata-hadoop-mapreduce\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would prefer a hassle free and self paced learning \nenvironment, accessible from any part of the world. \n\nAll topics related to ‘Big data,hadoop and Map reduce’ have extensively been covered in our course ‘Big Data and Hadoop’.\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co \nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India: +91-8880862004"
