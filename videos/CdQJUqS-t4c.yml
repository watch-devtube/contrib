description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nAs data scientists, building on published research allows us to stay on the cutting edge and not reinvent the wheel. However, in most cases, this transfer is not trivial. My talk will provide you with a five-step workflow that has made this transfer easier for me.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/ellenkoenig/pydata-bln-2018-five-things-i-learned-while-prototyping-ml-papers\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
