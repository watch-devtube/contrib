recordingDate: 1435348348
description: "From Solid Conference 2015: From “ecosystem” strategies to the war on terror, from the copyright wars to the subprime lending industry, it seems like everyone wants to build an Internet of Treacherous Things whose primary loyalty is to someone other than the people with whose lives they are intimately entwined.\n\nYour gesture-driven, voice-controlled future is a future in which you are never off-camera, never out of range of a mic. The difference between a world where computers say “Yes, Master” and computers say “I can’t let you do that, Dave,” is the difference between utopia and dystopia.\n\nEFF is laying the legal groundwork for an Internet of Things That Do What You Tell Them, and we need your help!\n\nAbout Cory Doctorow (craphound.com):\nCory Doctorow (craphound.com) is a science fiction novelist, blogger, and technology activist. He is the co-editor of the popular weblog Boing Boing, and a contributor to “The Guardian”, “The New York Times”, “Publishers Weekly”, “Wired”, and many other newspapers, magazines, and websites. He was formerly director of European affairs for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (eff.org), a non-profit civil liberties group that defends freedom in technology law, policy, standards, and treaties. He holds an honorary doctorate in computer science from the Open University (UK), where he is a visiting senior lecturer; in 2007, he served as the Fulbright Chair at the Annenberg Center for Public Diplomacy at the University of Southern California.\n\nHis novels have been translated into dozens of languages, and are published by Tor Books and simultaneously released on the Internet under Creative Commons licenses that encourage their re-use and sharing, a move that increases his sales by enlisting his readers to help promote his work. He has won the Locus and Sunburst Awards, and been nominated for the Hugo, Nebula, and British Science Fiction Awards. His latest young adult novel is PIRATE CINEMA, a story of mashup guerillas who declare war on the entertainment industry. His latest novel for adults is RAPTURE OF THE NERDS, written with Charles Stross and published in 2012. His New York Times Bestseller LITTLE BROTHER was published in 2008. A sequel, HOMELAND, was published in 2013. His latest short story collection is WITH A LITTLE HELP, available in paperback, ebook, audiobook and limited edition hardcover. In 2011, Tachyon Books published a collection of his essays, called CONTEXT: FURTHER SELECTED ESSAYS ON PRODUCTIVITY, CREATIVITY, PARENTING, AND POLITICS IN THE 21ST CENTURY (with an introduction by Tim O’Reilly), and IDW published a collection of comic books inspired by his short fiction called CORY DOCTOROW’S FUTURISTIC TALES OF THE HERE AND NOW. THE GREAT BIG BEAUTIFUL TOMORROW, a PM Press Outspoken Authors chapbook, was also published in 2011.\n\nLITTLE BROTHER was nominated for the 2008 Hugo, Nebula, Sunburst, and Locus Awards. It won the Ontario Library White Pine Award, the Prometheus Award, as well as the Indienet Award for bestselling young adult novel in America’s top 1000 independent bookstores in 2008.\n\nHe co-founded the open source peer-to-peer software company OpenCola, sold to OpenText, Inc. in 2003, and presently serves on the boards and advisory boards of the Participatory Culture Foundation, the Clarion Foundation, The Glenn Gould Foundation, and the Chabot Space & Science Center’s SpaceTime project.\n\nIn 2007, Entertainment Weekly called him “the William Gibson of his generation.” He was also named one of Forbes magazine’s 2007/8/9/10 Web Celebrities, and one of the World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leaders for 2007.\n\nHis forthcoming books include ANDA’S GAME (a graphic novel from FirstSecond).\n\nOn February 3, 2008, he became a father. The little girl is called Poesy Emmeline Fibonacci Nautilus Taylor Doctorow, and is a marvel that puts all the works of technology and artifice to shame.\n\nCheck out these related O'Reilly products: 'Opportunities and Challenges in the IoT: A Conversation with Cory Doctorow and Tim O'Reilly' (free eBook; http://oreil.ly/1NbyR3V) and 'Abusing the Internet of Things' by Nitesh Dhanjani (http://oreil.ly/1eHFPTz).\n\nWatch more from the 2015 Solid Conference: https://goo.gl/4TNIww\nFind out more about Solid: http://oreilly.com/go/solidcon\nDon't miss an upload!
