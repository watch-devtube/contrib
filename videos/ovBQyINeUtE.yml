description: "by Matias Martinez\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2213/ml_on_code_astor.webm\n\n\nAstor is an open-source framework for repairing buggy Java program, which includes 5 publicly available  repair approaches.\nThose repair approaches take as input a buggy Java program (having at least one failing test case that exposes the bug) and search for a patch that produces all test cases to pass. Astor provides twelve extension points that form the design space of program repair.\nUsing those extension points, program repair researchers can create new repair approaches or extend those included in the framework by choosing  existing components (among 33 ones) or implementing new ones.\nIn this talk, we will first discuss the main techniques proposed on the field of automated software repair.\nThen, we will discuss how to execute repair approaches included in Astor framework, how to extend them, and how to implement new repair approaches reusing components provided by Astor. \n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:30:00+01"
