description: "Intro: Open Policy Agent - Torin Sandall, Styra \n\nOPA helps you unify control and visibility of policy enforcement throughout your system. Today you can leverage OPA to enforce policies across the stack in modern projects like Kubernetes, Istio, and Terraform as well as with older (more established technologies) like Linux PAM. This session will introduce the OPA project, use cases, and integrations and include a short demo. The session will also include an overview of how you can get started contributing to OPA in the form of core development, integrations, and policy libraries. If you are interested in learning about how to use OPA or how you can get started contributing to the project, this session is for you. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Grbn"
