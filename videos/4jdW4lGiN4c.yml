title: 'This Startup Life: A Developer''s Mistakes and Tips - Ben Cull'
recordingDate: 1543328683
description: "It's been 552 days since I had the arguably dumb idea of trying my hand at a startup. Little did I know the sheer volume of learning I'd be doing in the future, from basics like cashflow and forecasts to life lessons like always be talking to new people.\nIn this talk I tell the story of how I went from a full time .NET Developer, to a struggling and then mildly successful startup owner. We'll explore how I made the transition from full time employment to self-employment; we'll look at many of the mistakes I've made and how to avoid them; and we'll go through some practical tips to get you started on your own startup journey. My first tip? Learn from other people's experiences!\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
