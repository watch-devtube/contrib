title: '"The Hard Parts of Open Source" by Evan Czaplicki'
language: English
recordingDate: 1539227602
description: "As more people enter /r/elm and the Elm discourse, I have thought a lot about how \"online communities\" work. Patterns of conflict. Why those patterns exist. Structures that would diffuse that conflict in healthy ways. Initially I just wanted to get yelled at less, but I instead stumbled upon \"a cultural history of open source\" that may reveal a path to more civil and productive online communication in general.\n\nAttendees will leave with (1) an inside perspective on open source projects, (2) a historical and cultural framework that I think can improve online communities right now, and (3) some interesting references and ideas to explore further in their own projects and interactions.\n\nSpeaker: Evan Czaplicki"
