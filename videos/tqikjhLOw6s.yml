title: 'Abstraction Considered Harmful (and other opinions about writing maintainable code) by Erik Stenman'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474364584
description: "http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016/erik-stenman\n\nSince I started programming I have enjoyed higher and higher levels of abstractions in programming languages from 6502 Assembler, via C, Pascal, Basic, Lisp, ML, Scala to Erlang. For many years I also got into a habit of writing frameworks and abstractions in a misguided attempt to live up to the DRY principle. In the last decade, I spent more and more time reading, debugging and maintaining code than writing new code. This has opened my eyes to the real meaning of DRY and other abstractions. Really successful programs are written once and read thousands of times; this realisation puts the emphasis on writing readable programs. In this talk, I will give some examples of readable and perhaps even more examples of unreadable programs, and in the process, I hope to give you some ideas on how to write maintainable code.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\nMake you think about how to write maintainable code.\n\nTarget audience:\n\nDevelopers writing (Erlang) code for long running servers."
