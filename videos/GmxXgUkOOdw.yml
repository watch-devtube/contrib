description: "Paulo Lopes, Principal Software Engineer, RedHat\n\nDo you suffer from Java fatigue? Are you blocked from introducing JavaScript in your project just because you traditionally deploy only on the JVM? This session shows how you can fight this. Let’s run JavaScript faster than Node.js on GraalVM! You will learn how you can run JavaScript and enjoy both the NPM and Java ecosystems. The presentation is not about simple scripting but about building real reactive systems in JavaScript with the help of the Eclipse Vert.x and GraalVM projects."
