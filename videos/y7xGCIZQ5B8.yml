This versatile and tightly integrated component collects performance and session data from various subsystems within the server during runtime with minimal impact on overall server performance.With help of few real world use cases, this talk aims to explain how/what statistical information user is provided with using Performance Schema. With these use cases, it also explains how this information can be used for monitoring and trouble shooting to track an issue back to the relevant file and line of code in source file. Again, with some use cases, this talk also explains how Performance Schema gives consolidated view of different activities of MySQL server behind the scene with the multiple summary tables and how this can be tuned and used. This talk also covers the manual/automatic configuration of Performance Schema to suite to individual requirement in a specific scenario.This talk is targeted to many database users which includes DBA, Database Application developers, Database developers, Students. This talk is to give overview of MySQL Performance Schema and also how/what information can be collected using it and how this information could be used further for debugging/trouble shooting Database users' issue.Takeaways from the talk: - Overview of tuning and monitoring MySQL Server activities using Performance Schema. - Understanding of how to tailor the Performance Schema to track the data you want. - With few real world usecases, explain how to diagnosing problems with the Performance Schema.  - A glimpse of new features in Performance Schema in MySQL 5.7 GA.\r\n\r\n(Type: Talk | Track: Database - MySQL Day | Room: Curie & Hershel (Floor 2))\r\n\r\nEvent Page: http://2017.fossasia.org\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/5L1c/"
