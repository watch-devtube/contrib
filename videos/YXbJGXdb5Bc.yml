title: 'TypeScript for Every Part of Your Stack | Ryan Chenkie | EnterpriseNG 2020 #ngconf'
language: English
recordingDate: 1625594258
description: "The confidence we get from TypeScript in our Angular apps is great but what about the other parts of our stack? While it’s common to use TypeScript in an Angular app, it’s less common to use it in a Node backend. It’s especially less common to see database access be type-safe.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll look at how your team can be more productive by using the same types for your Angular app, TypeScript Node server, and also database access with Prisma. We’ll show how to do all of this in an Nx monorepo.\n\nLearn the best ways to build reliable web applications, write quality code, choose scalable architectures, and create effective automated tests at the Reliable Web Summit this August 26-27, 2021.
