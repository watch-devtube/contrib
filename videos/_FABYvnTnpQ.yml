description: "Today's session covers how to  build an API with node.js (Session 8 of the \"Programming from A to Z\" class at ITP http://shiffman.net/a2z/).\n\nIn this episode, I cover introductory steps to building your own RESTful API with node.js. I show you how to install the node framework Express, as well as how to use routes to deal with the GET requests. I also cover briefly what it means for an API to be a REST (Representational State Transfer) API.\n\n11:31 - Intro to Session 8\n22:21 - Node.js and Express\n41:02 - Handling GET Requests in Express\n55:44 - Handling JSON Data in Express\n1:13:52 - Q&A/Conclusion\n\nTo know more on this subject, visit my material on Server-side Programming and Node: http://shiffman.net/a2z/server-node/\n\nSupport this channel on Patreon: https://patreon.com/codingtrain\n\nSend me your questions and coding challenges!: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Topics\n\nContact: https://twitter.com/shiffman\n\nGitHub Repo with all the info for Programming from A to Z: https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F16\n\nLinks discussed in this video:\nNode.js: https://nodejs.org/\nExpress.js: http://expressjs.com/\nRepresentational state transfer on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer\n\n\nSource Code for the all Video Lessons: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code\n\np5.js: https://p5js.org/\nProcessing: https://processing.org\n\nFor More Live Streams: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bxnFR6no70vlxxuxDEzflz\n\nFor More Programming from A to Z: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YrbSJBg32eTzUU50E2B8Ch\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/72pj/"
