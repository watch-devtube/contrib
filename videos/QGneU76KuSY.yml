recordingDate: 1268439188
description: "By Jim Purbrick\r\n\r\nSecond Life is a large, on-line virtual world where avatars dance, fly, shop, play, meet, work, fall in love... and program.\r\n\r\nThis giant, collaborative development environment is run on a grid of over 30,000 CPUs that simulate the land of Second Life. Since August 2008 Mono has been available as a scripting engine for running interactive content in Second Life and over 27 million user created scripts are now running on Mono in Second Life. This talk will discuss our experiences using Mono in Second Life and our plans for the future.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
