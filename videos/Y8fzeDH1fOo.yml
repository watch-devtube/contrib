description: "The proliferation of IoT devices and sensors provides a more precise picture of the physical world for us to process in the digital world. Increased computing power has made the processing of this data more practical. We can now influence the physical world from the digital and vice versa in ways that simply were not possible before. What are the ramifications of this blurring of the boundaries?\n\nThis keynote examines both the technology changes that underpin the phenomena as well as the consequences to business, people, and society. New and exciting applications are possible, but there are also challenges to be managed."
