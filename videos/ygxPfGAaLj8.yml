recordingDate: 1327906210
description: "This February, O'Reilly's Strata conference returns to Santa Clara. Strata brings together the world's leading thinkers and innovators in the fields of business, data, and disruption. After last year's sold-out inaugural event, it's clear that Big Data is here to stay, and that Strata is the place to learn about it. In this online conference, we'll look at hot topics, brewing controversies, and cutting-edge technologies that promise to change how we live, work, play, learn, and love. Hear from some of Strata's marquee speakers about what's consuming them in the Big Data world in this web-based event.\n\nAbout Noah Iliinsky\n\nNoah Iliinsky has spent the last several years thinking about effective approaches to creating different types of information visualizations. He also works in interface and interaction design, all from a functional and user-centered perspective. Before becoming a designer he was a programmer for several years. He has a master's in Technical Communication from the University of Washington, and a bachelor's in Physics from Reed College."
