Google Wallet Instant Buy brings two click checkout to all major platforms: Android, mobile web, and iOS. Besides cross platform support, since last year we have been busy making Instant Buy even better. We've worked with developers to make it even easier to integrate and monetize physical goods and services on Android. We've listened to buyers and have made using Instant Buy a simpler experience. Whether you are looking to improve your existing app or build the next great mobile commerce app, you'll want to learn about Instant Buy and how it has improved conversions and sales for developers who are already using it.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
