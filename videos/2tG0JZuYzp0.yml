description: 'In this talk, I will describe: The physical architecture of Stack Overflow. How many servers are there? What is their purpose and what are their specs? The logical architecture of the software. How do we scale up? What are the main building blocks of our software? The tooling system. What supports our extreme optimization philosophy? The development team. What are our core values? What footprint do we want to leave as developers? Stack Exchange & Stack Overflow have been growing exponentially since 2008. They now encompass:120+ Q&A sites and millions of questions and answers.'
