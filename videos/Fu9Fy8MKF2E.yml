description: "Mark Swarbrick\nMySQL Principle Presales Consultant\nOracle\n\nMySQL is the world’s most popular Open Source Database. And, with MySQL 8.0 Document Store, you can mix SQL and NoSQL in the same database. For this session we will guide the developer and the DBA through an easy journey on developing MySQL applications in NodeJS. Our application will use both NoSQL and more complex SQL statements too. Finally, we will use the MySQL Shell to directly interact with MySQL in SQL, JavaScript and Python."
