description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nWhat are variants, why are they important, and how I use them? Once available to a developer, variants become one of the most commonly used tools in everyday programming. This talk will explore the venerable Boost.Variant library, discuss the improvements made by C++17’s std::variant＜＞, and close with a discussion of the exciting new language-based variant and pattern matching papers (proposed for C++20). This talk aims to be of practical utility in variant library usage and informative as to where things are heading.\n— \nDavid Sankel\nBloomberg\nNew York, New York\nDavid Sankel is a professional software developer/architect based in the USA and an active member of the C++ Standardization Committee.
