description: "This video looks at how to use an ArrayList to store the parts of a fractal as separate objects.  This allows a fractal to experience physics.  The Koch curve is used as a demonstration.\n\n(If I reference a link or project and it's not included in this description, please let me know!)\n\nRead along: http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-8-fractals/#chapter08_section4\n\nKoch: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake\n\nGitHub repository: https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples/tree/master/chp08_fractals\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Qbv6/"
