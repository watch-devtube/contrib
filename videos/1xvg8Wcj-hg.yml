title: 'Metaprogramming With The Groovy Runtime - Part 1 of 2'
language: English
recordingDate: 1404726660
description: 'The dynamic runtime nature of Groovy is one of the things that sets it apart from standard Java and makes it a fantastic language for building dynamic applications for the Java Platform. The metaprogramming capabilities offered by the language provide everything that an application development team needs to build systems that are far more capable than their all Java counterparts. This Part 1 of 2 will cover the runtime metaprogramming capabilities of Groovy. The session will dive deep into Groovy''s Meta Object Protocol (MOP) which implements the incredibly dynamic runtime dispatch mechanism. The session will include a lot of live code demonstrating really powerful runtime features of the language. This session is focused specifically on Groovy''s runtime metaprogramming capabilities. Part 2 of 2 will cover Groovy''s compile time metaprogramming capabilities'
