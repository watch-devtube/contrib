description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nJanuary 11, 2012\r\n\r\nPresented by Bruno Bowden\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nSanta Tracker runs on Christmas Eve to allow children the world over to follow Santa as he travels around the world. It has the unusual distinction of being a very large synchronized online service, generating large homogenous loads. This talk covers the technical aspect of how the service is run by Google, including how it exceeded 1.6 million requests per second in December 2011."
