description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/developing-a-geospatial-webservice-with-kotlin-and-spring-boot\n\n\"As described in this announcement I made on the Spring blog [1], it is now easy to create a Spring Boot application using Kotlin.\n\nThanks to a sample Geospatial messenger application [2], I will show how Spring Boot and Kotlin share the same pragmatic, innovative and opinionated mindset to allow you to build simple but powerful projects.\n\nThis talk will provide an opportunity to show how to use a relational database without JPA in order to use advanced PostgreSQL functionalities (like its powerful spatial database extender PostGIS or native JSON support) while keeping a lightweight stack.\n\nI will also demonstrate the upcoming Kotlin to Javascript transpiler that allows you to share code between client and server (domain model, validation) and to code your frontend with autocomplete, static typing and so on.\n\n[1] https://spring.io/blog/2016/02/15/developing-spring-boot-applications-with-kotlin [2] https://spring.io/blog/2016/03/20/a-geospatial-messenger-with-kotlin-spring-boot-and-postgresql\""
