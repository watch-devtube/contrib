How does DNS work? What is DNSSEC? And what exactly is it that she is the keyholder for? \n\nPart 2 will dive into the the Internet of Things. With IoT we are facing new and different security risks in the developed digital world. Suddenly human lives are at stake in a way they haven't been previously.
