title: 'Cross-platform Progressive Web Apps'

description: "Progressive Web Apps are the new hotness with Google pressing hard to make them the de facto choice for building mobile applications. Support for PWA’s is quite good in Chrome, FireFox, and Edge but what's to be done about Safari and iOS where many of the key API's are not supported. Six months ago I would have told you to wrap your PWA in an Apache Cordova/PhoneGap container to polyfill the missing functionality. Now Apple has moved aggressively to support PWA’s in desktop Safari and iOS 11.3 but there are still some quirks. In this talk, I'll show you how to create a PWA that runs on the web, Android, and iOS from a single code base. Take advantage of some new tools to easily deploy and test your PWA.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode+JS Interactive 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nSimon MacDonald, Adobe\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nNodeJS YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQPYJluYC_sn_Qz_XE-YbTQ"
