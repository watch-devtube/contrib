description: "Peeling Onions Without Tears - Reading and Writing Intuitive Abstractions in Scala\nScala is a rich language, which offers a lot of flexibility to developers. This freedom allows library designers to provide neat abstractions to conceal the complexity of the implementation. However, abstractions can also bring uncertainty about what the software really does, which can then erode the confidence of the unsuspecting reader.\n\nJon looks at how we can use functional and declarative styles to improve the way we write code to mitigate these negative effects, along with some examples of the best and worst code out there!"
