recordingDate: 1514641999
description: "Category Theory is known as one of the most terrifyingly abstract branches of maths, yet functional programmers swear by its effectiveness applied to code. How can this be? What makes it so useful for real-world software development?\n\nKen will answer these questions and more, explaining the basic concepts and terminology of Category Theory, how it reveals deep underlying patterns in our software, and why that matters.\n\nKen is a Melbourne-based FP enthusiast, who writes and speaks about programming, type systems, maths and other fun things. By day, he’s a Lead Developer at REA Group, and helps run the Melbourne Scala User Group.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
