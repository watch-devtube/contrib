However, every consecutive four-year interval since then has produced a new disruption, and the present era has ushered in its own with mobile, social and cloud technologies. It may seem as if the future will be just an extension of the last decade's technologies, but if history is any indication, when we look back, in 2018, at the previous four years, we'll see something as new and momentous as the milestones in the previous three decades.\n\nFew companies and services survive beyond their disruption era and it's only those that fall in love with the problem they are solving, not the method they are using to solve it, that persevere. For 30 years, Intuit has been building products that perform effectively at scale -- from DOS to a services-based architecture that serves 45 million customers across mobile, web and desktop. Cheryl Ainoa, senior vice president, platform development for Intuit will discuss how to recognize the signs leading up to major disruption you and your company need to prepare for, and how to adapt to and embrace innovation for the future. Whether it's scaling for experimental hardware, adapting development for unpredictable platforms or continuously maintaining intelligent systems, she'll share principles for solving real customer problems to inspire engineers to develop for the future, not just today.\n\nAbout Cheryl Ainoa (Intuit Inc.):\nCheryl Ainoa is the Chief of Product Development Operations for Intuit where she focuses on maximizing the agility and productivity of Intuit's product development teams and the development of platforms and central technology.
