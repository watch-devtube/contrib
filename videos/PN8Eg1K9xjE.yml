It was an event that changed the world forever. There were only about 40 people there, but those who attended were inspired to form their own bands, creating Joy Division, The Buzzcocks, The Fall and The Smiths. As these bands fade away, we're long overdue for another such event. Programmers are artists, and JavaScript is the new Punk Rock.\n\nMy talk will show that JavaScript can be used to write and perform music using the wonderful Web Audio API. I'll talk about why we should do this and why it's the future of music. By the time the conference is over you'll have burned your guitar, remixed a dozen tunes on GitHub, and started a JavaScript band that has its sights set on changing the world.\n\nIggy pop video: http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/arts-entertainment/music/punk-rock-comes-to-canada/gzowski-interviews-iggy-pop-1.html\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
