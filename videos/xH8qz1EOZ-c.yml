description: "How Did Our Garden Grow? Advances in the Cloud Foundry App Runtime's Container Engine - Tom Godkin, Pivotal & Georgi Sabev, SAP\n\nGarden (the Cloud Foundry App Runtime's container engine, optimised for PaaS workloads) saw awesome features bloom over the last year. Garden is the first production runtime to support rootless mode; a wonderful security benefit. Leveraging containerd, Garden now uses more industry standards than ever, allowing for a much more familiar operator experience. The new \"Garden Peas\" feature enables sidecar containers for Cloud Foundry. This makes the platform more secure and opens the door for cool things like cf ssh, intelligent routing and many more.\n\nAs well as introducing the new features, the talk will explain how operators can interact with the runtime container bundles generated by Garden to debug, extend and operate the platform.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/GAUx/how-did-our-garden-grow-advances-in-the-cloud-foundry-app-runtimes-container-engine-tom-godkin-pivotal-georgi-sabev-sap"
