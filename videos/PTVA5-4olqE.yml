description: "Tools of the Javascript Trade \nby Frank Reding \n(@mottokrosh)\n\nIn the land of the full stack developer, npm is king. When server-side Javascript landed with NodeJS, a new era was born. A fresh, passionate community exploded onto the scene, bringing with it a myriad of command line tools written in Javascript, ranging from useful to indispensable. Build and deployment tools, task runners, and more, suddenly became part of front-end development, much like it had been for years for older, more mature languages -- only smaller, faster, and more powerful.\n\nWe'll look at some of the most popular Javascript tools, when, how, and when not to use them, and examine one, very opinionated, complete workflow, amid a sea of endlessly customisable ones. Just make sure you don't drown in the many whimsical or gaudy names they have.\n\nFrank is a senior front-end developer at Neontribe (they of the pulp prototyping fame), where he constantly seeks to eek out extra performance from web apps masquerading as native mobile apps. Unless he gets distracted by modern PHP frameworks, or new design tools.  "
