title: 'Abhay Balkrishna Mhatre: Inside Service Fabric Resource Provider (SFRP)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1535389203
description: "Meet Abhay, a Senior Software Engineer on the Service Fabric team. Abhay works on the Service Fabric service that manages Service Fabric resources across all of Azure. Yes, there is some circularity here, but the good kind. \n\nAzure is composed of a number of so-called Resource Providers that span VM provisioning to Network creation to CPU and Memory allocation to Storage binding to Service Fabric cluster provisioning an management (SFRP). \n\nIn this conversation, Abhay takes us through what happens when you create a Service Fabric cluster in Azure. You will learn about how Azure provisions cloud environments across any number of application/service types. You'll also gain deep insight into Service Fabric cluster management (from the outside - so, a service that manages deployment and provisioning of SF resources across all Azure regions, which also happens to be a Service Fabric application itself...). There is a lot of information in this one, so take your time and pay close attention. \n\nThanks as always to Deep and our special guests! Please tweet to @Carmine007 and @deepkapur for suggestions and feedback. Thank you for watching!\n\nLearn more about Service Fabric: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/"
