I will work my way through the graphics stack, starting with kernel drivers and end with the X server, talking about the various components along the way. In this presentation I will talk about the FreeBSD Graphics effort and the team behind it. \n\nI will give an overview of the various components that make up the FreeBSD graphics stack, starting with the kernel drivers and subsystem, and then work my way through the stack. I will talk a bit about Mesa, the X server and other software in the FreeBSD graphics ecosystem. \n\nI will also talk a bit about the team behind it, what is going on, and where we are going, as well as challenges working with and porting the graphics software. \n\nThis talk is intended to give a broad overview of the FreeBSD Graphics stack and the team working on it. I will not go into too much technical details on each part of the Graphics stack, instead focusing on the big picture. \n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 14:05:00+01"
