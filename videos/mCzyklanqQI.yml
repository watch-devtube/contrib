description: 'Go faster than your competitors. That’s the promise of microservices – deploy faster, scale faster, be more robust. It’s all about outcomes and the way your organisation is structured has a tremendous impact on those outcomes. it’s easy to say “Conway’s Law” and then move swiftly on. “But but but, but how?” In this talk James explores what we mean by business capabilities and how architecture and organisational design interact. He may even mention Isomorphism.'
