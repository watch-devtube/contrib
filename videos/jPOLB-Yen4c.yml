title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Bending Behat''s Benefits'
recordingDate: 1493191922
description: "SLIDES\n\nBehat is a tool for having better conversations with your team about expectations for the software being built. By it's nature, Behat separates the expectations (the steps written in feature files) from the implementation details (the PHP files that define the steps). This separation of concerns can make Behat both powerful and cumbersome. Once comfortable with Behat's complexity, there is room for a lot of creative usage.\n\nThis session will cover some of the good, bad, and ugly ways Pantheon uses Behat include:\n\nTesting our command line tool, Terminus.\nSharing tests of core WordPress behavior across multiple WordPress plugins.\nOverriding some Behat classes to change how shared steps are executed (for example, changing the execution of user login steps for SAML).\nNightly tests of Drupal and WordPress core.\nVerifying Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 data migration.\nProviding authenticated traffic to compare performance of PHP 5 vs. PHP 7.\nRemote execution of Behat tests against sites installed on Pantheon."
