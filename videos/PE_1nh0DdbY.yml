description: "As a programmer, I make hundreds of mistakes every day. I only check a few of them into source control because I'm able to discover my mistakes within seconds. Fast unit tests uncover some mistakes, but to get maximum confidence I rely on full-stack functional acceptance tests as well. Over the past couple of years, I have discovered techniques for making functional acceptance tests run in milliseconds. \n\nThe effect on productivity is almost unbelievable. In this talk, I'll demonstrate those techniques. I'll also explain how to organise functional tests so they can be run in different configurations, optimised for confidence or speed.\n\nThis video was recorded at SCLConf 2018, an annual conference for software professionals that care about their craft.
