title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2012: Robert Muir - Automata Invasion'
recordingDate: 1545060428
description: "Finite-state technology, including automata and weighted finite state transducers (wFSTs), are compact data structures well suited to text processing and searching applications. Low level support for both automata and wFSTs is available in Lucene and has recently enabled a number of surprisingly powerful improvements. In this talk, Robert Muir will provide an overview of finite-state technology and then describe how it's used today in Lucene: synonym filtering, fuzzy queries, respelling/suggesting, terms dictionary, in-memory postings format (MemoryPostingsFormat) and Japanese analysis (Kuromoji analyzer).\n\nMore Info: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/automata-invasion\n\nDescription of Robert Miur: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/robert-muir"
