description: "We all know how it goes...Android users rag on iOS users and vice-versa. On forums, social networks, within companies, and, of course...those keynotes. Just like cats and dogs.\n\nBut, what if it wasn't like that?\n\nIn a world where iOS engineers are Swift engineers, and (perhaps) Android engineers are Kotlin engineers, might we have more in common, than not? If \"design and code\" means we're all designers now, and if the \"t-shaped engineer\" is the new normal, then why do we diverge completely at implementation?\n\nWhat if, instead, both teams worked together, designed together, solved problems together? Let's stop taking our cues from Apple and Google, and instead take them from our own engineering culture; sharing, supporting, teaching. Who knows, we might just start something infectious, something our whole company, maybe the whole community, picks up.\n\nNow wouldn't that be a welcome change in these divisive times?\n\nMichael has been an iOS engineer since just after the app store launched, and various incarnations before that, including Windows when NT meant New Technology and Java when it had a Mobile Edition. He has helped develop several notable apps for the likes of Time Out, Songkick (where he met Romain, who he is doing this talk with), Lyst, The Guardian, Viz, and Shazam.\n\nCurrently, he is working for a brand new #insurtech (of course it has its own hashtag) startup called Wrisk — trying to make insurance less vile. Michael is far too fussy about what coffee he drinks and very easily upset by bad user interface design.\n\nRomain has been an Android developer for 6 years. He has had the chance to work on exciting apps like Yammer, Blablacar and Songkick (where he met Michael). Recently, Romain joined the Android team at Deliveroo. When he is not being picky while reviewing pull requests, he is passionate about emojis, gifs, running, and reading (sometimes not in that order)."
