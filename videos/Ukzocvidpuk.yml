title: 'Cisco - Cloud = Application Enablement and Innovation ? IaaS (Cloud Foundry Summit 2014)'
recordingDate: 1404352889
description: "Keynote presented by Ken Owens, CTO, Cloud Services at Cisco.\n\nInfrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a very small part of the overall cloud adaption requirements needed to enable business agility, growth, and transformation. This is an area that service providers and Telcos have been trying to optimize with traditional BSS, OSS, and provisioning systems over the last several years. The overall market for cloud in these providers is very small and not growing quickly due to their lack of development and application enablement in the physical and virtual layers. These layers are becoming commodity and not easy to differentiate business capabilities on without adding tremendous cost from enterprise software and advance services. Even with this added cost, enterprises are failing to transform because basic IaaS is a very small part of their business needs. This is not to say that IaaS does not matter. Where IaaS matters is their efficiency and platform capability that enables businesses to innovate and develop seamlessly. Consider the power to your home and office. Typically you do not worry about the quality and performance of that power. You do not call up the power company and ask for the power plants specs and performance characteristics. It's a utility and you use it. For the most part, it is reliable and available. The importance in building a cloud application enablement platform is to have a utility model mindset and ensure the platform is efficient, scalable, and 100% interoperability across other cloud solutions including PaaS and SaaS. There is too much focus on IaaS which is just a very small and commodity platform. For application enablement and development, it is critical to have an open scalable platform. This aspect is not \"magic\" as many cloud service provider and Telcos try to have you believe. Remember, they do not get it and are still trying to just get the basic hardware, software operating with their traditional OSS and BSS. The industry has settled on open source platforms and the leaders here are Cloud Foundry and Openshift, but the platform characteristics are what's important to understand. The industry has settled on Application Platform as a Service (aPaaS) and Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS). aPaaS represents the cloud services that offer development and deployment environments for application services. These services must be interoperable across cloud service provider boundaries. This is accomplished through open common development libraries. iPaaS is represented by a suite of services that enable development, execution, governance, workflow integration, and policy controls. This presentation will dive into the integration specification of IaaS Platforms with PaaS Platforms by discussing the architecture of: Multi-tenant Services; HA service architecture that is interoperable across multiple cloud solutions; Middleware Stack including message bus; Data Storage and Access; Data Analytics; Deployment Management (multi-vendor); Asynchronous processing capabilities; Flexible Security framework ie integration into SecSDLC; Data Protection; SOA Support; and a Common Management Architecture (console, log, metering, monitoring, performance)."
