recordingDate: 1493186051
description: "The promise of open source technology has always been about the ability to spread and scale. This is exemplified with Drupal distributions. In this session we will examine how we are leveraging open source, Drupal 8 with one of the largest federated non-profit organization in the world, the YMCA. We will focus specifically on a community driven initiative, Open Y, which is a Drupal distribution custom built for YMCAs everywhere. Some specific topics we will go over include:\n\nLeveraging open source software to foster sharing and collaboration.\nDeveloping a communication strategy focused on key benefits of Drupal and open source, such as cost and speed of innovation.\nCreating a sustainable model in a federated organization from small to large YMCAs.\nThis session will reveal how open source software and Drupal can drive business results with better customer experiences, faster speed to market, and lower costs. It should be beneficial for all community members regardless of the position."
