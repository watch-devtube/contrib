description: "In this HTML5 tutorial we'll discover how to build a webpage layout in 2017. \n\nI'll reveal to you how to build the page layout with CSS3 display grid and flexbox, a.k.a. display flex. We'll find out about properties like grid template column, grid template row, grid column, grid row as well as justify-content and align-items.\n\nOur HTML5 page will be minimal and quick. Most still wonder how it's possible to be that simplified and straight forward.\n\nThere is also a live drawing where I'll show you how to look at a layout and visualise it using coloured pens and paper. \n\nOnce you take the display grid way you'll never want to go back. No more floats, no more negative margins. The nightmare is finally over!\n\nThis setup needs NodeJS and Gulp to run correctly so if you haven't got those ones check the “required tools” playlist and get it done.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlgRhtOkjmmCI1l-jZhq_z93omN7USqUC\n\n## Help us help you and others by subscribing to our YouTube channel using the following link:\nhttp://youtube.com/codetap?sub_confirmation=1\n\n## Or like our page on FaceBook:\nhttps://facebook.com/codetap\n\n# Related videos:\nHow to make a website for free in 3 easy steps 2017\nhttps://youtu.be/YBK5ZyXHumE\n\nInstall nodejs, gulp v4, git and github\nhttps://youtu.be/A-iTEtt6SN8\n\nCode like a PRO for beginners\nhttps://youtu.be/Y6Gz1ceMDNE\n\nInstall Visual Studio Code\nhttps://youtu.be/VNbxJyw-bwM\n\nInstall Atom Text Editor\nhttps://youtu.be/v5TaKvcLu7M\n\nStart coding with a 4 years old\nhttps://youtu.be/Cd-l-i0zyAc\n\n# Powered by \nhttp://codetap.io and http://bitbee.uk\n\n# Free resources\nW3Schools where you can discover HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/\n\nFree Code Camp - Amazing community where you can test your skills in well prepared challenges\nhttps://www.freecodecamp.org/\n\n# Powered by \nhttp://codetap.io and http://bitbee.uk\n\nMusic by:\nJPB - High [NCS Release] https://youtu.be/Tv6WImqSuxA\nSoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/anis-jay\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/jayprodbeatz\nTwitter https://twitter.com/gtaanis\nInstagram http://instagram.com/gtaanis\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nPlease watch: \"Build HTML5 website pain free tutorial for beginners 2017 - CodeTap\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCyokdeZ6jI\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-"
