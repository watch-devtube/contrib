description: "Most of us don't have to think too much about module bundlers in our day jobs. However, module bundlers are all around us, and if you’re a web developer you are probably using one on a daily basis.\n\nIn this talk, Ronen helps you understand how most module bundlers work and shows you that they’re not as scary as you might think. Ronen does that by live coding a simplified example of a modern module bundler in JavaScript."
