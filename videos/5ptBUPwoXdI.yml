title: 'Developing multiplatform projects in Kotlin (Dmitry Jemerov, Germany) [RU]'
language: Russian
recordingDate: 1528193801
description: "In Kotlin 1.2, we’ve added support for developing multiplatform projects. Multiplatform projects allow you to reuse the business logic written in Kotlin between all the components of your application – backend code on the JVM, frontend code in JS, and also mobile apps. The common code is compiled for all platforms and can access platform-specific implementations of APIs and libraries. The platform-specific parts are also written in Kotlin and have access to the full set of features of the corresponding platform.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll look at language and IDE features that support developing multiplatform projects, and at the libraries that can be used in such projects. As an example, we’ll study a project that supports isomorphic HTML rendering, or, in other words, reuses the HTML building code between the frontend and the backend."
