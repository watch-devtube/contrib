description: "This is a video of Harro Verkouter's talk at London erlang Factory Lite http://www.erlang-factory.com/\n\nIn radio astronomy - the field I work in - data processing requirements are so large we have to build custom hardware to actually do it. In the talk I would like to introduce the observation technique we currently use, very long baseline interferometry, and the hardware that is currently being developed for expanding its capabilities. Feeding and controlling this FPGA powered device will require a distributed system also capable of controlling embedded devices remotely over a network. A primary objective was to produce a system where the hardware developers and VHDL programmers (not generally Erlang savvy programmers) should also be able to use the code to easily interact with their logic code running on the FPGAs.\n\nTalk objectives: I would like to show that Erlang is really good at what it was written for: interacting with (embedded) systems, dealing with binary data, running a distributed system for monitoring and controlling it. \n\nTarget audience: Technology oriented people with an interest in low level programming or global high-speed network connections being used in a real time radio astronomical application. Talk may contain traces of physics."
