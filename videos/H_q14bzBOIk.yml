recordingDate: 1468311547
description: 'We aren’t sure about you, but working with Java 8 made one of the speakers to stop shaving and the other lose his sleep. If you still didn’t reach the level of Kuksenko or Shipilëv in mastering lambdas and strings, this talk is for you. And if you think you did, we have some bad news for you, you should attend as well. We’ll show you some surprising, bizarre and inconceivable parts of Java 8 and make sure that you won’t be (too) surprised when it hits you in production. As any other puzzlers talk, this session will consist of two speakers, lots of puzzling questions, answers by the audience, t-shirts flying around and a lot of fun, all for one purpose – to make you understand Java 8 better.'
