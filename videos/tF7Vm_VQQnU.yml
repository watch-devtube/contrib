As part of Bisq’s “decentralize everything!” approach, the organization that develops Bisq is in the process of transforming itself into a DAO. \n\nBisq DAO is a second-layer solution on top of Bitcoin blockchain. The Bisq DAO enables, among other things, payment to Bisq contributors, the appointment of roles in the Bisq organization, and the adjustment of parameters in the Bisq trading protocol. \n\nThis talk presents an overview of the technical design of the Bisq DAO, with a focus on the high level blockchain model that enables a construction of a second layer DAOs on top of Bitcoin. The Bisq DAO is already up and running, currently in a testing environment, with a scheduled mainnet deployment set for 2019. \n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 15:10:00+01"
