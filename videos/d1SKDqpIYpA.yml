description: "#testedAF: Test All the Things (Not Just Your Units) - Bryon Kroger, United States Air Force & Quynh Tran, Raytheon\n\nThe United States Air Force’s Kessel Run has made headlines for the incredible fuel savings from the tanker planner application and for taking their deployment frequency from 5 years to 1 week. What often goes unstated is that they are also building applications where failure carries life and death consequences and, as such, the larger organization they are part of takes testing very seriously. Not only that, they spend even more time on upfront planning than is seen in even the worst offending commercial enterprises. And talking to real end users? Forget about it, they have an active mission to support! Breaking through those barriers took a lot more than just a robust suite of unit tests.\n\nPivotal Cloud Foundry is key in that it provided the Air Force the platform they needed to ignore all the things below the value line and focus on expanding their testing practice to meet the demands of their enterprise: testing assumptions around building the right thing, building the thing right, and was the right thing built. Find out how Kessel Run established the means to go fast forever, continuously delivering business value their users LOVE by testing all the things!\n\nAbout Bryon Kroger\nAir Force Captain Bryon Kroger is Founder and COO at Kessel Run, where he leads operations for an enterprise-scale software lab running a worldwide cloud platform and 22 customer-facing products.
