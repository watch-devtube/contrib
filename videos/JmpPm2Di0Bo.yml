description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nMay 12, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Hanno Sander\r\n \r\nI built a balancing robot that uses vision to dance with people using the Parallax Propeller multi-core processor. My talk will cover the robot and the tool I wrote to build and debug sophisticated embedded systems. ViewPort now supports computer vision using OpenCV, fuzzy logic, physics simulation, and monitoring telemetry with simulated instruments. I use Google Checkout, Analytics, CustomSearch, and Adsense to sell my software on my website: http://mydancebot.com\r\n \r\nHanno Sander has been working with computers since he programmed a lunar lander game for the z80 when he was six. Since then, he graduated from Stanford University with a degree in computer science and then started his corporate career as an Internet entrepreneur. Hanno moved to New Zealand in 2005 to spend time with his growing family and develop sophisticated, yet affordable, robots  starting with the DanceBot. His technical interests include computer vision, embedded systems, industrial control, control theory, parallel computing, and fuzzy logic."
