description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/christopher-meiklejohn\n\nHow can you maintain consistency across a large number of devices that are sporadically connected?\n\nIn this talk, we will look at on-going work being performed by the SyncFree research group, a FP7 EU-funded research project on large-scale, synchronization-free computation. We will look at several use cases provided by Rovio Entertainment, makers of Angry Birds, and propose several possible designs to solve consistency problems across mobile devices: an environment where clients can go offline and be partitioned from the network for a indefinite amount of time.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- The objectives of this talk are to discuss alternative designs for offline gaming where consistency and deterministic execution is paramount.\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- People interested in distributed computation.\n\nAbout Christopher\n\nChristopher Meiklejohn is a Senior Software Engineer with Machine Zone, Inc. working on distributed systems. Previously, Christopher worked at Basho Technologies, Inc. on the distributed key-value store, Riak. In his spare time, Christopher develops a programming language for distributed computation, called Lasp. Christopher is starting his Ph.D. studies at the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium in 2016."
