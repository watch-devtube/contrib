description: "From the 2014 Solid Conference, Jim Stogdill's Keynote talk explores how advancements in hardware and software, and how they can interact with physical objects, has broken down the barriers separating the \"real\" and \"digital\" world. In the spirit of Solid, the web has become tangible, integrating into our everyday lives.\n\nAbout Jim Stogdill (O'Reilly Media, Inc.):\nJim Stogdill heads up O'Reilly's Radar and Strata businesses.
