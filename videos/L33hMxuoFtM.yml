description: "Love how you can use Google Forms to poll your colleagues or create a pop quiz for students? Creating 1, 5, or even 10 Forms by hand may be reasonable, but what if you needed to create 100s or 1000s?

In this DevByte from Google engineer Wesley Chun, you’ll see just how easy it is.\n\nWatch all Launchpad Online videos at https://goo.gl/rb69Ge\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L -\nSubscribe to the brand new Firebase Channel: https://goo.gl/9giPHG"
