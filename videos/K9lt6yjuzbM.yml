description: "This talk was recorded at Scala Days New York, 2016. Follow along on Twitter @scaladays and on the website for more information http://scaladays.org/.\n\nAbstract:\nScala Futures are one of the most, if not the most, used abstractions for dealing with asynchrony and concurrency in Scala. In this session we're going to go through what's new for Future in Scala 2.12 and how to take advantage of it, and discuss common pitfalls & useful programming patterns for dealing with Futures. The session may or may not also contain rants on designing primitives for concurrency control, spontaneous rebuttals of common criticisms around Futures, and extremely poor and nonsensical analogies."
