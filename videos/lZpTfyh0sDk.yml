description: "Replicated SDS with DRBD & LINSTOR An Open Source SDS for the automated management of storage clusters\nby Robert Altnoeder\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1308/replicated_sds_drbd_linstor.webm\n\n\nPresentation of the LINSTOR SDS system, which automates the management of different types of block storage volumes on a cluster of storage servers, with a focus on replicated storage for high availability and disaster recovery. \n\nFocus on architecture &amp; implementation of the system, integration with other software and the development process. \n\nIntended audience: \n\n\nOperators, Architects, Developers of cloud &amp; virtualization environments\nOperators of systems based on software defined storage\nOperators of OpenStack, OpenNebula, Proxmox virtualization platforms\nOperators of Kubernetes/Docker containerization\n\nFocus of the lecture &amp; discussion: \n\n\nExisting storage technologies, focus on Linux: block devices in general, device mapper/LVM, ZFS, DRBD, dmcrypt, etc.\nChallenges of automating storage management (allocation/modification (resizing, ...)/deallocation of volumes)\nChallenges of managing clusters (parallelization, networking, ...)\nOur solutions - how the system works, protocols involved, security model, configuration persistence, transaction safety, etc.\nSome interesting implementation details\nHow the development team works - methods, processes, project management, the tools that we like to use\n\n\n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 18:15:00+01"
