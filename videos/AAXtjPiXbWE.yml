description: "In this talk Peter introduced XProf, an open-source visual profiler for Elixir, a new addition in the spectrum between complex monitoring software and clever, command-line tracing and debugging tools. \n\nXProf was originally created to help solve performance problems of live, highly concurrent and utilised back-end systems. However over time it has turned out to be useful for general ad hoc debugging, as it is capable of both intuitive visual feedback on bigger patterns and provide details if necessary. \n\nDuring the talk Peter demystifed tracing and match-specs, an extremely powerful toolset provided by the Erlang VM, and shows how XProf makes it more accessible and easier to use for everyone."
