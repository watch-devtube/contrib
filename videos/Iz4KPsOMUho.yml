Four years ago we released mod pagespeed to implement those suggestions automatically, so every web site can get the basics right with less human effort, putting decent performance within the range of mortals. We'll discuss some of the lessons have have learned over the years. Where has PageSpeed has been effective? How do we balance our reliance on tools against learning and implementing best practices to create great websites?\n\nPhoto of Joshua Marantz\nJoshua Marantz\nGoogle\nJoshua Marantz is a software engineer at Google, where he is tech-lead of mod_pagespeed, a project to build an open-source Apache module for automatically improving website latency and reducing bandwidth consumption by rewriting HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Images.
