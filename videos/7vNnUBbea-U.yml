recordingDate: 1298044196
description: "In this talk Ben will go over a series of (surprising) observations backed by comprehensive data from the U.S. iTunes app store. He will present statistics and metrics that will help app sellers, marketers, and developers, understand recent dynamics in the U.S. app store. Along the way we'll uncover clues and strategies for boosting app downloads. To the extent that many other app stores share features similar to the iPhone, patterns and strategies presented should be relevant in other app ecosystems.\n\nBen Lorica\n\nO'Reilly Media\n\nBen Lorica is the Senior Analyst in the Market Research Group at O'Reilly Media, Inc..
