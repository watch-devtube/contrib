title: 'Designing Wonderful .NET APIs - James Newton-King'
language: English
recordingDate: 1506326744
description: "There are .NET libraries that are complex to setup, hard to understand, difficult to debug, and impossible to extend. And then there are .NET libraries for the same task that wonderfully just work. Why do some libraries succeed where others fail?\n\n\nIn this session we will discuss what makes a well designed API, from high level design principles like The Pit of Success, The Wall of Complexity, and The Power of Sameness, to applying those concepts in low level .NET class design, with the goal of creating .NET libraries that developers love to use."
