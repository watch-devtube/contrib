title: 'DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Writing Modular JavaScript with Browserify'
recordingDate: 1462914336
description: "Developing a modern web application requires an increasing amount of JavaScript code.  If not managed properly, you'll quickly find yourself dealing with a tangled mess of libraries and dependecies. Browserify can help.\n\nBrowserify is a flexible and powerful build tool for JavaScript.  At the most basic level, it allows you to bundle your JS code using CommonJS style modules that will run in the browser. It also offers a plugin and transformation api. Allowing you to process your scripts as they are bundled. \n\nIn this talk we'll look at the benefits Browserify and walk through practical examples, including:\n\nOrganizing your code into smaller modules for better reuse.\nRequiring 3rd-party modules from npm.\nSeparating your JS application's markup into clean template files.\nTranspiling ES2015 (ES6) code to ES5 with Babelify.\nMinifying code with Uglify.\nSetting up super fast incremental builds with Watchify.\nExtracting shared dependencies into common files with automatic code-splitting.\nWhether working with Drupal 7, 8, or a headless frontend, you'll come away with a deeper understanding of what Browserify is and concrete steps to integrate it into your workflow.\n\nThis talk is geared toward developers who have experience with JavaScript and may have used other nodejs based tools such as Grunt, Gulp or node-sass. Those with experience using Browserify or Webpack are bound to learn something new as well."
