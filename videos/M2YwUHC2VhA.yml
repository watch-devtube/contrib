description: "Where Does Cloud Foundry Stand in the Containers’ Ecosystem? - Surya Duggirala, IBM\n\nAs container technology is becoming the de facto choice for cloud platforms, it is essential to compare various container ecosystems. As the industry is embracing microservices and service mesh technologies like Istio, there is a common question around how Cloud Foundry fits in this space. The main intent of this session is to compare Cloud Foundry’s garden containers with other container technologies like Docker and Kubernetes and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each of these container technologies. This session also looks into the latest advances in Cloud Foundry Platform and how it is strengthening the cloud native deployments.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyE/where-does-cloud-foundry-stand-in-the-containers-ecosystem-surya-duggirala-ibm"
