description: "by Gratien D'haese \r\n\r\nDisasters do happen, big or small, so we better be prepared before these happen.\r\n\r\nCommercial Operating Systems ship tools to help you prepare or create images for several years already. However, Linux still lacks a good standard tool delivered with the core system tools (besides tar) to assist with creating a disaster recovery images. As you can image a disaster recovery (DR) exercise is more then just restoring a plain backup.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of the presentation we will guide you through the different steps in creating a Linux Disaster Recovery Procedure with Relax and Recover (rear).\r\n\r\nRear is a modular disaster recovery engine completely written in bash and released under GPL v2 license. Rear can store the details about your systems on hard disks (network, USB, SAN,...) or network (PXE, NFS, CIFS,...) including the complete backup. It also creates a bootable image which you need to recreate your system from scratch. Furthermore, thanks to the modular concept, we can integrate rear with foreign backup solutions (commercial or not) to do the backup and restore part which makes rear very scalable in big enterprises.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of the presentation we will explain how to build a Linux Disaster Recovery as a Service with rear-server.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org"
