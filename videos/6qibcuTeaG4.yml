description: "The rise of NodeJS and its lightweight approach has brought great benefit to the enterprise. It has also brought intermittent availability, unstable builds & potential vulnerabilities.\n\nJavascript isn't going away anytime soon so this quickie aims to provide some mitigations that mean your next npm install is more skill than luck.\n\nWe'll see how Gradle can standardize versions, Nexus will provide a safety net, Docker can help with builds as well as how npm shrinkwrap works.\n\nPaul Watson is Java developer and co-founder of Weaselworks (http://wsl.works), a London based IoT startup.\n\n[JVP-2134]"
