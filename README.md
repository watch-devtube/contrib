# Dev.Tube Contribution Data

Let's build the best technical video hub together! Check out ðŸ¥‡[contributors leaderboard](https://dev.tube/contributors).

## What help is needed?

* please help fixing video metadata
* please help adding speakers
* please help [improve the website](https://github.com/watch-devtube/web/issues)
* please contribute new channels

## Channel or playlist contribution guidelines

* Conference talks are accepted.
* Panel discussions are accepted.
* High quality video tutorials are accepted (only time-proven channels, with no aggressive marketing)
* No webinars.
* No commercial videos (product or company advertisement or hiring promotions).
* We do not add videos shorter than 5 minutes. Short videos are automatically ignored.
* If your channel contains commercial videos, but you still want to share some of the technical videos, please, create a playlist and share that instead.

Channels and playlists can be added to [channels.yml](https://github.com/watch-devtube/contrib/edit/master/channels.yml).

## How to edit video metadata

* Please use spaces for formatting.
* Please, only add speaker information if it is a **real single person**. Collective names or organization accounts will not be accepted as a valid speaker metadata. We plan to implement multiple speakers per video at some point (follow up [here](https://github.com/watch-devtube/web/issues/50)). 

The structure of the video metadata looks like this:

```
tags:
    - tag1
    - tag2
speaker:
    name: Speaker full name
    twitter: SpeakerTwitterHandle (no @)
title: Title goes here
language: English
featured: true (you need to have enough karma points, see https://dev.tube/contributors)
recordingDate: 1444245407 # 
description: Some text goes here #
```

## How to remove a video

If you want a video to be removed, create a new GitHub issue and explain why you think the video should be removed. In particular, we'd appreciate if you created issues for marketing videos.

## Video auto-tagging

In addition to editing video metadata, auto-tagging is supported. Auto-tagging takes place when video metadata is modified or a new video is ingested.

Contribute to auto-tagging by modifying [tags.yml](https://github.com/watch-devtube/contrib/edit/master/tags.yml)

## Speaker auto-discovery

When a new video is ingested, Dev.Tube tries to determine author's twitter account.

Contribute to speaker auto-discovery by modifying [speakers.yml](https://github.com/watch-devtube/contrib/edit/master/speakers.yml).

## FAQ

### I made a contribution, but do no see the change
Videos are updated few times in a week, but we try to do it more frequently. We're also working on the solution to make changes on the fly.
